I J Macfarlane: Medium-term developments in the Australian economy
Speech by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to Australian Business in
Europe, in London, on 26 May 2000.
 It  is  a  great  pleasure  to  be  in  London  again  speaking  under  the  auspices  of  Australian  Business  in
Europe. The last time I spoke to this group in London was in mid-1998, which was very close to the
low point of the Asian crisis. My main purpose on that occasion was to reassure investors in the City
that Australia would get through the Asian crisis in reasonable shape. As you are, no doubt, all aware,
the results were better than any of us could have predicted at the time. The economy continued to grow
at  4%  plus,  inflation  remained  low  and,  although  the  balance  of  payments  deteriorated,  it  was
temporary and not all that different to what has occurred on a number of other occasions in the past 20
years.
The international situation is a lot different now. Most of the Asian economies are growing again and
world output growth is a good deal stronger than in 1998. At the same time,  the  structure  of  world
interest rates has moved up, as has Australia’s. Whereas two years ago the focus of attention was on
Asia and other emerging markets, the focus now seems to be more on the United States than in any
earlier stage I can remember.
I would like to take the opportunity today to update some of the things I said two years ago, but to do
so  in  a  way  which  focuses  on  medium-term  developments.  I  will  take  as  my  starting  point  a
comparison of economic growth rates of developed countries over the most recent decade (Table 1).
These figures from the OECD show that except for Ireland, which everyone in this audience would
know  is  a  very  special  case,  the  Australian  growth  rate  has  been  higher  than  for  any  comparable
OECD country. (Incidentally, each of the countries in this list experienced a recession at some stage
earlier in the decade, which helps explain why the decade averages look a bit lower than the growth
rates that we have been accustomed to over the past few years.)

For me, however, the interesting thing about this table is that this is the first decade in my working life
where Australia has figured in the top half of the table, let alone being virtually in the top position. We
must have been doing something right.
One of the things that we are doing right is that we have kept the 1990s expansion going longer than
the expansions of the 1970s or the 1980s (Graph 1). The 1980s expansion was quite a strong one but it
turned  down  midway  through  its  seventh  year.  The  1970s  expansion  was  a  much  weaker  one  even
though it lasted a bit longer. The 1990s expansion shown in the diagram covers the eight-and-a-half
years to December 1999, but we are confident that it has continued through the ninth year, and by the
time we reach the September quarter we will be in our tenth year. So, sustainability of the expansion is
the first key to our improved performance.
The second key is improvements in productivity. Here, if we use the simplest measure of productivity,
which is labour productivity, the pattern in Australia is very similar to the pattern in the United States
(Graph 2): strong growth in the 1960s, a flattening out in the 1970s and 1980s, followed by a pick-up
in the 1990s. But the pick-up in the 1990s in Australia has been more pronounced than in the United
States. We have gone from 1.7% per annum to 2.9% per annum, whereas the United States went from
1.5%  per  annum  to  2%  per  annum.  I  do  not  want  to  suggest  that  this  means  we  have  higher
productivity  than  the  United  States;  remember  we  are  only  talking  here  about  rates  of  change  of
productivity. The fact that we have been able to speed up more than they have is, in large part, because
we were starting from a lower base.
BIS Review 46/2000

Whilst I am on the subject of productivity, I want to make two general points:
The first is the obvious one which I have made on numerous occasions that the main reasons behind
the pick-up in productivity growth have been structural changes made over the past  15  years in the
Australian  economy  which  have  increased  flexibility  and  competitive  pressures.  These  changes
include:
     further tariff reductions;
financial deregulation;
labour market deregulation;
privatisation; and
a more stringent regime of competition policy.
It has not been easy to put these changes in place, even though there has been for most of the decade
considerable  bipartisan  political  support  for  change.  Inevitably,  compromises  have  had  to  be  made
and, viewed in isolation, some of the individual changes do not look to be all that thorough. But taken
together, I think the total is larger than the sum of the individual parts. Of course, one aspect of the
economy that was not reformed during this period was the tax system. But that will change in about a
month’s time when a Goods and Services Tax is introduced to replace the old wholesale sales tax and
to take some of the weight off income taxes.
The second point about productivity I want to make concerns the new economy/old economy divide.
Some  people tend to judge  a  country’s  technological  sophistication  by,  for  example,  the  number  of
listed  companies  in  the  IT  sector.  Although  Australia  has  a  number  of  companies  that  fit  this
description,  about  70  or  so  in  fact,  their  combined  share  of  the  stock  market  is  not  large  by
international standards. But that is only one measure of technological sophistication. Another equally
important one is the country’s or the business sector’s willingness to embrace new technology. This
may be a better guide to productivity improvements than focusing only on the IT sector. I have two
measures of the spread of technology:
- 
The first is Internet usage per cent of population, which shows Australia in a relatively high
position of the countries compiled by the Consulting Group, NUA (Table 2).

 A measure that is more specific to the business sector is the number of e-commerce servers
per  head  of  population.  On  this  measure,  Australia  is  second  only  to  the  United  States

So, in terms of willingness to adapt to new information technology, Australia would get a very high
score. This, along with the measures I mentioned earlier, helps to explain why there has been such a
significant lift in the rate of growth of productivity over the last decade.
A big lift in productivity growth has a beneficial effect on many areas of the economy. A lot of it is
passed through to consumers and, in the process, this makes it easier to maintain low inflation. Some
of it can also make businesses more profitable, which is, after all, the incentive that drives much of the
efforts  towards  improving  productivity  in  the  first  place.  The  two  broadest  measures  of  corporate
profits as a percentage of GDP in Australia have been trending up over the past decade, with profits
after interest showing a much sharper rise than profits before interest, again another indirect benefit of
low inflation (Graph 3).
BIS Review 46/2000

You will note that this measure of corporate profits is adjusted for privatisations. If that had not been
done, the lines would have trended up more sharply because of the significant number of privatisations
that have occurred over the last decade. Largely as a result of these privatisations, the percentage of
the population in Australia who are now direct shareholders has risen sharply and is exceptionally high
by  world  standards.  The  proportion  who  hold  shares  directly  is  41%.  I  have  not  got  a  table  of
comparisons  with  me,  but  I  believe  this  figure  is  now  about  as  high  as  in  the  United  States.  If  we
added  to  the  number  who  directly  hold  shares,  the  number  of  people  who  voluntarily  hold  shares
through equity unit trusts (or mutual funds, to  use  US terminology),  the  number  would  go  to  about
54%. And, of course, if we added in those who contribute to an accumulation pension fund, exposure
to shares would be almost universal.

Can  I  turn  now  to  inflation?  If  we  look  at  an  international  ranking  of  inflation  rates  over  the  past
decade comparable to the one I showed for real GDP growth, Australia finishes in the middle of the
field  with  an  average  inflation  rate  of  2.3%  per  annum  (Table  4).  This  is  a  huge  improvement  on
previous decades, but, of course, virtually every country has also shown a significant  improvement.
There are a number of factors behind this improvement, but the one I would like to mention today is
our  monetary  policy  regime.  Like  a  number  of  English-speaking  countries  -  the  UK,  Canada,  New
Zealand - Australia has a monetary policy regime which is based on the trilogy of an inflation target,
5
BIS Review 46/2000
an independent central bank and a floating exchange rate. Our inflation target is not all that different
from that of the UK in that we aim for an average inflation rate of somewhere between 2 and 3% over
the long term, recognising that it could go above or below that range from to time, but like the UK, it
is the average that matters.
One consequence of lower inflation in Australia is the convergence of our bond yields to international
norms,  or  at  least  the  US  norm  (Graph  4).  Some  of  you  may  have  been  able  to  remember  that  as
recently  as  a  decade  ago,  Australian  government  bonds  were  400  basis  points  higher  than  US
government  bonds.  We  think  of  that  as  the  bad  old  days,  but  if  you  were  an  international  funds
manager, you may look back on it as the good old days.
Another factor that has contributed to the improved acceptance of Australian government paper is the
recognition that our fiscal policy is very responsible by international standards. The Budget has been
in  surplus  for  some  time  now.  This,  together  with  the  proceeds  of  the  privatisations  I  referred  to
earlier, has meant that the outstanding stock of government debt has fallen in absolute terms, and as a
percentage of GDP is now the lowest among developed countries (Table 5).

I  am  not  sure  how  fully  aware  international  investors  are  of  these  excellent  figures  on  growth,
inflation,  productivity,  public  debt,  etc.,  so  I  have  taken  the  liberty  today  of  indulging  in  a  bit  of
BIS Review 46/2000

trumpet blowing. One economic fact, however, that markets are aware of is that Australia always runs
a substantial current  account  deficit  and,  therefore, is  a  net importer  of  capital.  I  have  nothing  very
new to say on this subject other than to point out that it is the result of private agents’ decisions rather
than government’s demands on capital markets, and that its magnitude has not changed very much in
the last 20 years. It has varied cyclically, of course, but around a basically flat trend. At its cyclical low
points it tends to be about 3% of GDP, and at its high points a bit over 6% (Graph 5). In this cycle,
which  was  heavily  influenced  by  the  contraction  of  our  Asian  markets, the  deficit touched  6.1%  of
GDP in the September quarter of 1999, but has since fallen noticeably. The conditions are right for
further falls over the next year, given that exports are now growing rapidly again (up 19% over the last
12 months). The medium-term issue, of course, is whether the capital we are importing is being put to
good use. The output growth, the productivity growth and corporate profit story suggest that it is.
So far this year, exchange rates have been in the forefront of attention. For the first few months of this
year,  the  Australian  dollar  declined  quite  sharply  against  the  US  dollar,  more  so  than  other  major
currencies. More recently, it has been a bit steadier, while a number of other currencies have weakened
more noticeably against the US dollar. With firstly the euro, then the pound, then some other smaller
currencies joining in, the position of the Australian dollar is now not so lonely. With the United States
being perceived as the country most likely to need higher interest rates, we should not be surprised by
an  international  adjustment  mechanism  which  has  seen  other  currencies  all  falling  by  a  somewhat
similar amount against a rising US dollar.
Turning to the medium term, these developments have meant a fall in the Australian Trade-Weighted
Index or effective exchange rate over the course of 2000. The more noticeable thing, however, is that
since about the second year of the period of floating in Australia, i.e. since about 1985, the Australian
dollar in effective terms has fluctuated around  an essentially  flat trend,  with its  present  value  being
near the low end of this range (Graph 6).
I think I have taken enough of your time on the medium term. Turning briefly to the period ahead, we
expect that the current expansion will continue into a tenth and eleventh year, i.e. for the length of our
current forecasts. Beyond that, the outlook is too distant for us to forecast. We are conscious that the
reason we have done so much better this time than in previous expansions is that we did not let the
usual  late-cycle  imbalances  develop.  The  most  common  of  these,  of  course,  is  inflation.  We  are
confident that our early action on monetary policy, plus our adherence to the discipline of the inflation
targeting regime, will mean that we continue to maintain low inflation in the years ahead.
