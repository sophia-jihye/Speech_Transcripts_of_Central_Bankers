I J Macfarlane: A medium-term perspective on monetary policy
Speech by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to Queensland University of
Technology Business Leaders’ Forum, held in Brisbane, on 10 August 2000.
 It is a pleasure to be here in Brisbane to address the Leaders’ Forum Luncheon. I am not sure that I
will have much to say about leadership, but I hope that my comments will be of interest and relevance
to those attending today. I would also like to thank the Queensland University of Technology, which is
to be congratulated for running this excellent series of lectures.
I  would  like  to  take  the  opportunity  today  to  restate  the  underlying  logic  behind  our  approach  to
monetary policy. My reason for doing so is not that it is intrinsically difficult, and therefore in need of
repetition in order to aid understanding. It is because the logic is essentially medium to long-term in
nature,  and  hence  tends  to  get  lost  in  the  day-to-day  welter  of  economic  statistics  and  associated
commentary. For those whose interest is in the details of the current economic statistics, we will be
publishing our quarterly review, The Economy and Financial Markets next week.
Our approach to monetary policy, like that of a number of other countries in similar positions, is based
on  the  achievement  of  an  inflation  target.  This  says  that  over  the  medium  term,  inflation  should
average somewhere between 2 and 3%. We recognise that it will not always stay in this range - that is
why it is expressed as an average over the medium term. The actual adjustment of interest rates, of
course, is done on the basis of our assessment of the outlook for inflation, including a central forecast
and a judgment about the balance of risks. But if we have done the job well, we should be able to look
back and see that over a reasonable run of years inflation has averaged 2 point something per cent per
annum.
So far in stating our approach I have not mentioned economic growth or employment, but there is a
reason for approaching things in this order. It is not because we downplay the importance of growth
and employment - we certainly do not, and in any case our Act makes it clear that to do so would be
contrary to our mandate. We approach monetary policy in this order because there is overwhelming
evidence to suggest that countries can only have sustained expansions if they are accompanied by low
inflation. It is the sustainability of the expansion which is the key to maximising economic growth and
employment.  Thus,  another  way  of  expressing  the  aims  of  a  monetary  policy  based  on  inflation-
targeting is to say that its aim is to maximise the length of the economic expansion.
A cynical observer might say that it is all very well to emphasise the length of the expansion as the
crucial  test  now  that  we  all  know  that  the  current  expansion  has  been  a  long  one.  But  this  is  an
approach  which  we  have  had  for  quite  a  long  time.  I  remember  explaining  it  to  a  Parliamentary
Committee in early September 1996 immediately before I took up my present position.

I think there is a reasonable consensus forming in Australia, as there is in a number of other countries,
that inflation-targeting is a  good  approach  to  monetary  policy. The  most  persuasive  argument  in  its
favour is that the results achieved so far have been very good. For example:
• 
The  current  economic  expansion,  which  started  in  the  September  quarter  of  1991,  has
already lasted longer than its two predecessors and, on current indications, still has a fair way
to go. The accompanying graph shows the expansions which started in the 1970s, 1980s and
1990s.  For  the  current  expansion,  the  figures  only  go  up  to  the  March  quarter  2000.
Incidentally,  the  length  of  our  expansion  is  very  similar  to  the  much  better  known  US
expansion - ours has lasted for 36 completed quarters (including June 2000), theirs has lasted
for 37 completed quarters.
  During this time, economic growth has averaged 4.1% per annum, with inflation averaging
in the low two’s. So the good result on inflation was not achieved by sacrificing our growth
performance.
While  a lot  of  countries  have  done  well  over  the  past  decade,  the  Australian  performance
stands  out.  We  have  grown  faster  than  other  comparable  countries  (including  the  United
States) and our inflation rate puts us in the middle of the field. The table below shows that
only Ireland, which had very special circumstances, grew faster than Australia.
In  short,  the  results  suggest  that  the  inflation-targeting  approach  to  monetary  policy  has  been
successful  in  achieving  its  aim.  Also,  the  fact  that  Australia  has  been  virtually  at  the  top  of  the
international growth league, while achieving a respectable middle order ranking  on  inflation,  shows
that we have not over-emphasised inflation control at the expense of economic growth.
While I think there is now a consensus that the inflation-targeting approach to monetary policy makes
sense, there is always room for disagreement about how it is applied in practice. Such differences of
view are part and parcel of the normal policy debate, and we of course participate in it and listen to
other views. In passing, I should say that I think the debate is carried out in a much more civilised way
these days, compared with a number of earlier periods I can remember. I attribute this improvement to
the fact that there is now wider agreement on the underlying model than in earlier periods.

Nevertheless, differences of view remain, and I would like to say a few words about  some  of them
today.
The  first  area  where  there  is  always  room  for  differences  of  view  is  on  how  to  interpret  the  many
individual pieces of economic data that come in virtually every day. How important is any particular
statistic?  Is  it  indicating  strength  or  weakness?  Are  there  special  factors  that  have  to  be  taken  into
account before it can be interpreted? Does it have any implications for monetary policy? This “bottom-
up”  approach  is  widely  used  and  it  means  that  there  is  almost  daily  discussion  in  the  media  and
elsewhere of the current and future strength of the economy.
My observation over the past four years is that the bulk of people expressing a view on this subject
invariably argue that the economy is weaker than the Reserve Bank judges it to be. There are very few
on the other side to act as a balance. The majority of people who present a view think that the Reserve
Bank has a recurring tendency to over-estimate the strength of the economy.
This view is quite wrong: the fact is that we have consistently under-estimated its strength. You only
have to consult my half-yearly appearances before the Parliamentary Committee to see that on every
occasion I have had to explain to them why the modest slowdown in growth that we forecast did not
arrive. The correct way of summarising the various views is to say that the Reserve Bank has under-
estimated the strength of the Australian economy, while its  critics  have  under-estimated  by  a  larger
margin.

This is  not  unusual. There is a  tendency  during  the  expansionary  phase  of  the  business  cycle  to  be
unduly influenced by the inevitable signs of weakness in some of the individual indicators and hence
to lose sight of its underlying strength. There is a tendency for people to not be able to see the wood
for the trees. This is true of most economists, bureaucrats, politicians, the press and, as I pointed out
above, central bankers are not immune from it. It is one of the reasons why historically there has been
a  tendency  to  leave  the  tightening  of  monetary  policy  till  too  late  in  the  cycle.  By  then,  various
imbalances - particularly, but not only, inflation - have become established and policy has had to be
tightened  by  a  larger  amount  than  if  it  had  been  done  in  a  more  timely  manner.  This  has  been  an
important  contributor  in  many  countries  to  shortening  the  expansion  phase  or  to  making  the
contraction deeper and so producing a boom-bust cycle.
That is why if the central bank wants to have any hope of getting its timing right it has to move ahead
of  public  opinion.  This  will  mean  that  the  tightening  phase  will  inevitably  attract  criticism  from
various  quarters  and  will  be  labelled  by  some  as  unnecessary  or,  at  least,  premature.  That  is  why
governments  have  entrusted  monetary  policy  to  independent  central  banks  -  in  order  to  ensure  that
monetary policy is insulated from day-to-day political pressures, and to make it clear to the public that
this is the case.
A  second  area  where  differences  of  opinion  are  often  expressed  is  on  how  to  reduce  the  level  of
unemployment. Now, in my opinion, there are a lot of policies that have a role to play in this task, one
of which is monetary policy. There was a time not so long ago when economic purists, including some
central  bankers,  often  denied  that  monetary  policy  could  affect  unemployment  -  in  their  view,
monetary policy only affected inflation. You will be pleased to know that I am not a member of that
school.  Bad  monetary  policy  can  certainly  make  unemployment  worse,  so  it  follows  that  good
monetary policy can make it better than it would otherwise have been.
What is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to lowering unemployment? My answer
is that the best thing it can do in the long run is to provide the conditions which maximise the length of
economic expansions. We do not want a seven or eight-year expansion followed by a serious recession
as we have had in the past. The damage to unemployment occurs during recessions. The significant
rise in unemployment that occurred in Australia from the early 1970s to the early 1990s was not due to
a prolonged period of weak economic growth, it was due to the fact that we had three relatively short
periods of recession, each of which resulted in a big lift in the unemployment rate.

To repeat, it is not the insufficiency of growth during the expansions which accounts for Australia’s
current  rate  of  unemployment  -  it  is  due  to  the  sharp  rises  that  occurred  during  the  recessions.  To
illustrate by reference to the US again:
BIS Review 64/2000
4
  during  our  current  expansion  GDP  has  grown  at  a  rate  of  4.1%  per  annum  in  Australia,
compared with 3.7% in the US;
over  the  same  period,  we  have  reduced  our  unemployment  rate  from  its  peak  by  4.6
percentage points compared with 3.8 percentage points for the US. The fact that their rate at
4.0% is lower than ours at 6.6% is entirely due to their lower starting point, which was due to
the relatively mild nature of their early 1990s recession.
In  short,  it  is  clear  that  the  best  thing  that  monetary  policy  can  do  to  reduce  unemployment  is  to
prolong the expansion and delay and reduce the size of any subsequent recession. On occasion, that
means  tightening  monetary  policy  early  to  forestall inflationary  pressures,  as  an  alternative  to  more
vigorous application of the brakes when inflation has built more momentum.
A third question which could be asked about our approach concerns Australia’s potential growth rate.
We are, I think, rightly proud of our growth performance during the current expansion, especially of
our average of 4½% per annum since mid-1997 when we were hit by the Asian crisis. But some may
ask why we think 4½% is a good result -  maybe the economy was capable of growing a good deal
faster without pushing up inflation by much. We have all heard of Australia’s improved productivity
performance in the 1990s, so why can’t this allow us even more growth?
There are two answers to these questions - a mechanical one and a policy one:
• 
The mechanical one is that the potential growth rate is determined on the supply side of the
economy  by  the  growth  of  the  labour  force and  the  rate  of  labour  productivity.  While  the
second  of  these  is  now  about  1½%  per  annum  higher  than  in  the  eighties,  the  first  -  the
growth of the labour force - is 1¼% per annum lower. This is largely due to lower growth in
the working-age population, and a much smaller rise in the participation rate as the female
participation rate is now already quite high and the male participation rate is declining. So
the improved productivity trend has contributed to higher living standards, but its effect on
total GDP growth has not been as marked.
 The more important answer is the policy response; it is one that I gave three years ago at a
time when a number of critics were claiming that the RBA would not permit the Australian
economy to grow by more than 3½% per annum. The answer then, as it is now, is that we do
not have firm views about a speed limit. Our tightenings or loosenings of monetary policy
are determined by the inflation outlook. If the economy wants to grow faster than it currently
is, and inflation is not showing any tendency to rise to the point where it could threaten our
medium-term  objective,  then  we  would  not  restrict  the  economy’s  growth.  That  was  true
three years ago, and it is still true: the difference is that now inflation has moved up, whereas
three years ago it was moving down.
The rise in inflation over the past year, though a little larger than forecasters had expected, is not an
alarming event. But it is a reminder to us that it would have been unwise to continue with the stance of
monetary  policy  we  had  in  mid-1999.  Monetary  policy  at  that  time  was  at  its  “maximum-
expansionary”  setting  for  the  decade,  and  in  our  view  some  degree  of  tightening  was  going  to  be
needed  if  we  were  to  successfully  manage  further  progress  in  the  expansion.  A  number  of  other
countries reached a similar conclusion over the past 18 months for reasons not very different to the
ones I have outlined above.
Conclusion
I have tried to give an outline of how the inflation-targeting approach operates and how it contributes
to  improved  performance,  not  only  on  inflation,  but  also  on  output  and  employment  growth.  The
outline  is  necessarily  broad  and  I  am  afraid  it  will  disappoint  those  who  wish  to  have  answers  to
specific questions such as why did we raise rates in one month rather than the next? - or why did we
raise  rates  by  50  basis  points  rather  than  25?  Inevitably,  the  answers  to  these  questions  involve  an
element of judgment. But the truth is that the answers are not very important in the medium term.

BIS Review 64/2000
Rather, it is the average level of interest rates that matters. Have we allowed them to stay too low and
so encouraged the build-up of an inflationary process, or have we raised them too high and so set in
train a contractionary or deflationary process? These are the important questions, and any judgment on
them must be based on the medium-term performance of the Australian economy. This may not be a
simple task, but I would suggest that a favourable judgment would require that the macro-economic
performance of the Australian economy be better than in earlier decades, and that it stand up well in
comparisons with the experience of other countries over the same period.
