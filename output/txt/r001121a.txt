T K Alweendo: Prospects for growth and employment in Namibia
Annual  speech  by  Mr  T  K  Alweendo,  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Namibia,  held  in  Windhoek  on
15 November 2000.
 Introduction
1.
This year’s subject matter is growth and employment or unemployment, depending whether you are an
optimist  or  a  pessimist.  Some  of  you  may  be  surprised  by  the  choice  of  a  topic.  It  is  true  that
“Prospects  for  growth  and  employment”  can  be  regarded  as  a  topic  that  does  not  fall  within  the
primary responsibilities of the central bank.
Conventional wisdom strongly suggests that monetary policy in itself can do little to generate growth
and employment. This may sound surprising as it is within the domain of the central bank to influence
the quantity and price of money in the society.  The  problem,  however,  is  to do  so  without creating
inflation,  which  in  the  longer  run  will  harm  growth.  Although  this  question  of  a  possible  trade-off
between  inflation  and  growth  has  been  debated  for  a  long  time,  the  compromise  seems  to  be  that
monetary policy is most conducive to high employment and growth when price stability is maintained.
Available  evidence  from  both  developed  and  developing  countries  does  not  support  the  view  that
monetary policy can accelerate growth and reduce unemployment at the cost of a higher inflation rate.
Why should this topic of growth and employment then be of concern to the central bank? The simple
answer is that growth and employment prospects are the single most important issues on any economic
policy agenda.
The objective of this speech is limited to taking stock of what we know today and indicating what in
our  view  should  be  the  main  elements  in  future  strategies.  We  have  to  acknowledge  that  empirical
evidence  strongly  suggests  that  there  is  not  a  clearly  identifiable  single  set  of  variables  that  either
promotes  or  inhibits  growth.  My  main  contribution  will  be  to  support  current  efforts  to  stimulate
economic growth; to reiterate the need for the main stakeholders to fulfil their respective roles; and to
emphasise that we all have to work together.
The  ultimate  objective  of  economic  policy  in  any  society  is  to  ensure  a  satisfactory  level  of  the
citizens’ welfare and to improve it over time. Opportunity to work is a fundamental basis for private
welfare  and  the  lack  thereof  may  often  lead  to  personal  and  social  ills.  Economic  growth  and
employment should therefore, in the case of Namibia, be closely linked to poverty reduction. Poverty
is not only an assault on  human  dignity  and  deprivation  of  material  good,  but  also often  associated
with  lack  of  security  and  access  to  basic  services  including  health,  education  and  sanitation.  In
addition, poverty may have several economic consequences and be in itself an impediment to growth.
A review of conventional growth strategies
2.
Let me first review some of the theories related to economic growth. Development economists have
over the years established several theories in an attempt to explain dispersion in output growth among
countries that have similar resource endowments. Theories explaining such growth patterns have been
classified  into  two  main  groups:  neo-classical  or  exogenous  growth  theories  and  modern  or
endogenous theories.
The earliest exogenous theories attributed output growth to increases in factor inputs such as capital,
labour, land and natural resources and a residual called “technological progress”. The endowment of
human and natural resources, size, and geographical location, no doubt, are very important elements in
the growth process. These theories received a lot of attention in the earlier growth literature. However,
1

technological progress has in more recent discourse been identified as a fundamental determinant of
economic growth.

Endogenous growth theories, on the other hand, have emphasised the role of improvements in human
capital, financial intermediation, external trade and institutions as very crucial complementary factors
in economic development.
Most recently, in the wake of the poor growth performance of developing countries, the IMF and the
World  Bank  have  developed  some  stabilisation  cum  growth  models  to  stimulate  the  economic
performance of developing countries. They take into consideration the interaction among stabilisation,
adjustment and growth. Critics have focused on the long-run relevance of these models for economic
growth. However, evidence is beginning to emerge to support the existence of a long-run relationship
between  price  stability  and  economic  growth  giving  credibility  to  the  Fund-World  Bank  efforts.
Policymakers in many developing countries are beginning to appreciate the importance of policies that
are targeted at reducing the price level, with a view of stimulating economic growth and development.
These experiences offer important lessons for Namibia.

In a recent study, the Research Department at BON tested the relevance of some of these factors to the
growth process in Namibia. Using a simple model based on quarterly data for the period 1990-99, our
empirical results attest to the significant impact of financial factors proxied by the level of financial
depth and real credit to the private sector on the growth of output. Both exports and the real exchange
rate representing the trade factor, also turned out to be positively related to the real GDP. This study
revealed  that  when  exports  were  decomposed  into  two  components,  minerals  and  non-minerals,  the
positive contribution of the non-minerals component was quite astounding. Another thing that struck
us was the impact of the human capital factor, proxied in our model by the primary school enrolment
ratio  on  real  GDP  growth.  The  result  turned  out  to  be  strongly  correlated  to  real  GDP  growth,
demonstrating  the  effect  of  human  capital  development  on  the  growth  process  in  Namibia.  As
expected, the price level, though significant, turned out negatively related to GDP growth.
Growth and employment trends in Namibia
3.
In reviewing recent trends in Namibia, we find that real GDP growth for the period 1980-99 averaged
approximately 2.7%. For the period 1980-89, average GDP growth was about 1.3% compared to the
4.2% recorded for 1990-99. However, real GDP growth slowed down to 3.8% for the years 1995-99.1

The performance of per capita real income was more striking. After relatively large fluctuations in the
pre-independence  period,  real  GDP  per  capita  recorded  an  average  growth  of  about  1.9%  between
1990-99. Thus both real income and per capita real income have shown consistent declines since the
period after independence. It is this fall in general living standards that represents our challenge.
The  Namibian  economic  performance  since  1994  has  not  been  sufficient  for  providing  jobs  for  a
labour force that  grew  by  more  than  3% annually.  We  have  also registered  a  decline  in total  factor
productivity. This last factor is very worrisome since it implies that for every unit of capital invested in
the economy, less and less output is received in return. This is being held accountable for the flow of
savings outside the economy where  returns  are  higher.  The  combination  of a  declining  productivity
and outflow of savings keep growth below the potential for the nation.
1 These growth rates are based on revised national account figures for 1993-99, which will be publicised shortly.

BIS Review 104/2000
In relation to the First National Development Plan (NDP1) period, growth fell below the target rate of
5%,  which  was  considered  reasonable  to  significantly  address  the  problems  of  income  inequalities,
poverty and unemployment in the country. Unfortunately, no major strides were made in this regard as
economic growth remained weak and hence unemployment surged during this period.

Looking  more  closely  at  growth  on  a  sectoral  basis,  primary  industries,  consisting  of  agriculture,
fisheries and mining, performed rather sluggishly during the period. In particular, the share of mining
to GDP declined by 5 percentage points over the period due mainly to a secular decline in commodity
prices. The main commodity that has continued to dominate mining is diamond and its fortunes and
misfortunes directly translate into growth or stagnation in the economy.

 Manufacturing Sector Construction
Manufacturing  and  construction  are  the  two  main  sectors  that  have  contributed  steadily  to  output
growth  in  the  secondary  sector,  particularly  in  the  last  decade.  Manufacturing  has  continued  to
maintain a slow but consistent growth trend in the economy, with a contribution to GDP of about 10%

in 1999. The performance of construction has shown a rather irregular pattern since 1983. In the most
recent  years,  construction  has  been  sluggish,  due  mainly  to  high  interest  rates  following  the  global
financial crisis that engulfed most economies from 1997.
The dominant sub-sector in the tertiary sector is general government. The activity of this sub-sector is
followed by wholesale and retail, transport and communication, hotels and restaurants and community,
social and personal services, in that order. The ratio of general government to GDP, of some 22% over
the last  five  years,  is  quite  substantial.  This  has  given  vent  to  the  fears  in  certain  quarters  that  this
expansion might not be in the long-run interest of the economy, particularly if it crowds out private
sector role.

Private Consumption

BIS Review 104/2000
The incomes of households followed the developments in Gross National Income, as the share of wage
income remained relatively stable. Private consumption suffered for a greater part of the 1990’s under
the  weight  of  falling  real  incomes  and  rising  real  interest  rates.  On  the  other  hand  government
consumption  represented  a  disproportionate  share  of  GDP.  It  has  been  observed  that  among
developing countries, the share of government consumption in GDP, which is currently put at about
30%, is the highest.
Unemployment trends
The  labour  market  in  Namibia  is  characterised  by  an  excess  supply  of  unskilled  labour  and,  at  the
same time, a lack of skilled labour. Available data suggest that the unemployment rate rose from 33%
in  1994  to  35%  in  1997.  Lack  of  data  precludes  us  from  making  sufficient  observations  on  the
unemployment trends in the economy since then, but whatever little evidence there is, points to the
fact that the unemployment situation has worsened. Government remains the main employer of labour.
This  has  resulted  in  a  burgeoning  public  sector  wage  bill.  Although  available  statistics  show  that
sectors  such  as  finance  and  transport  are  making  necessary  efforts,  the  overall  situation  remains
difficult and requires a structural policy thrust.
Factors that impacted on growth and development
4.
In attempting to reduce the reliance of the economy on primary exports, the government objective has
been  to  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  through  a  strategy  of  diversification  since
independence. The promotion of manufacturing activities, development of the agricultural sector, the
fishing industry and tourism have been identified as having the most potential to provide impetus for
the diversification strategy under the First National Development Plan.
The  government  introduced  specific  measures  targeted  at  promoting  growth,  development  and  job
creation. These measures included the enactment of the Foreign Direct Investment Act 1990, which
provides  generous  tax  breaks  and  other  concessions  to  investors  and  the  export  processing  zones
(EPZ). A further measure is the disproportionate allocation of national expenditure to education and
health.
As we all know, Namibia is blessed with a significant supply of natural resources, such as diamonds,
uranium,  zinc  and  natural  gas.  Unfortunately  these  natural  resources,  particularly  diamonds  and
uranium, have been susceptible to exogenous influences in the form of demand or price shocks.

The share of minerals in total export declined from about 65% of total exports in 1990 to about 50% in
1994. Following an increase in subsequent years, the share fell to 49% in 1999.
Apart  from  demand  and  price  shocks,  Namibia  is  also  susceptible  to  other  natural  shocks,  which
influence growth. Recurrent drought spells, for example, caused agricultural output to decline by over
40% in the last three months of 1995. As nearly 70% of Namibians derive their livelihood directly and
indirectly  from  the  land,  these  droughts  have  caused  declines  in  agricultural  exports  and  farmers’
incomes.

Savings Investment
Let  me  now  turn  to  savings.  As  the  saying  goes:  “To  have  more  tomorrow  you  have  to  have  less
today.”  To  provide  funds  for  investment  at  the  national  level  there  needs  to  be  a  healthy  level  of
savings. For a greater part of the period after independence, investment has lagged behind savings. At
an  annual average  of  about  25%  of  GDP  for  the  period  1991-99,  the  savings  rate  ranks  among  the
highest  in  Sub-Sahara  Africa.  Given  the  savings-investment  gap,  Namibia  has  witnessed  a  constant
outflow  of  capital  and  a  matching  current  account  surplus  for  a  greater  part  of  the  period  under
consideration.  Gross  fixed  capital  formation  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  hovered  around  21%  for  the
period.
Both private and public investment has been on the decline, though this has been more pronounced for
private investment. Two important factors that have contributed to the decline in private investment
are the slowdown in government investment and the high interest rates that emerged after the financial
crisis  in  the  middle  to  late  1990s.  The  increasing  savings-investment  gap  has  remained  a  source  of
concern for policymakers particularly in the face of high domestic unemployment.
Technological  progress,  as  mentioned  earlier,  enhances  growth,  as  it  makes  it  possible  to  produce
more with the same quantity of resources. This boosts the potential level of output of the economy.
The unprecedented growth experienced in the United States in the last couple of years is said to have
been  spearheaded  by  technology  related  sectors.  It  is  important  to  note,  however,  that  the  pace  of
technological  change  is  likely  to  depend  on  the  quality  and  relevance  of  education  that  a  country
provides to its citizens.
Education has been identified as one of the priority sectors and a lot of resources have been allocated
to  this  sector  since  independence.  The  budgetary  allocation  to  the  two  Ministries  of  Education  has
increased  from  about  18%  of  total  expenditure  in  1990  to  about  24%  in  1999.  This  is  quite  a
substantial amount bearing in mind that low-income countries spend on average 13% of their national
budget on education.
7
BIS Review 104/2000
Despite the sizeable budgetary allocation to the education  sector,  a consensus  seems  to  emerge  that
suggests that the output from our education system is not commensurate with the input. Our schools
dropout and repetition rates are the highest compared to other similar countries, such as Zimbabwe,
Mauritius  and  Botswana.  For  example,  the  rate  of  grade  repetition  in  Namibia  is  as  high  as  25%
compared to an average of about 5% for these countries.

What  should  also  be  of  concern  is  that  a  breakdown  of  the  total  education  budget  into  type  of
expenditure reveals worrying trends. The personnel costs of the primary education budget accounts for
about  88%  whilst  personnel  costs  of  the  secondary  education  accounts  for  about  73%  of  total
secondary budget during 1999/2000.
If we accept the argument that human capital is essential for economic growth, then there could be a
case for re-evaluating the type and quality of education we are providing. This is necessary, not only
to ensure consistency with the long-term development needs of the country, but also to increase social
returns on our investment in education from the current low levels, as reflected in the high level of
unemployment, especially among our youth.
Main elements in future strategy
5.
Looking now into the future, the question is what Namibia can do to bring the economy on a path of
sustainable and healthy growth. As I have already emphasised the point, investments in physical and
human capital must continue.
However, it is far from obvious that high initial investments and savings are sufficient preconditions
for growth. The relatively high saving ratio in Namibia has not been transformed into high investment
and growth. As mentioned, one important explanation has been low and declining factor productivity
in the economy. Public investment will remain important, but investment opportunities must also be
made available to the private sector.
Although  our  present  knowledge  strongly  indicates  that  investment  is  probably  the  factor  closest
correlated with growth, it is crucial to identify other relevant factors that will trigger investment and
growth  in  Namibia.  Advances in  production  efficiencies  and technology  are  such  important  factors,
but so is the complicated interplay between economic and political factors.
BIS Review 104/2000

Let  me  start  with  sound  macroeconomic  policies.  Sound  macroeconomic  policies  basically  mean  a
sustainable fiscal balance and a supportive monetary policy.
The pressure on the public finances has been growing in recent years and the budget deficit has been
edging  up  and  public  debt  has  increased  as a  result.  Among  the  new  challenges that  will  affect  the
budget, is the reduced SACU receipts over the next few years. As our fiscal policymakers are aware,
bold measures are needed to make sure public finances are put on a sustainable path over the medium
term. These will include reduced expenditure on recurrent expenditures, especially on personnel costs,
and a broadening of the tax base. This should not increase the general tax burden, but rather contribute
towards its reduction. The announced review of the tax system and the introduction of a medium term
budgetary  framework  will  undoubtedly  contribute  to  a  more  efficient  tax  system  and  strengthened
expenditure control.
Turning briefly to monetary policy, we believe that the peg of the Namibia dollar to the rand and our
membership  in  the  Common  Monetary  Area  (CMA)  have  contributed  to  securing  broad  financial
stability. Our objective is to expand the role of the CMA in the direction of a true regional monetary
union. Recent initiatives have strengthened the role of the smaller members in information exchange
and in providing input into the monetary policy making process in the CMA.
Also within the domain of the central bank is our payment system reform project, which is aimed at
establishing an automated payments system that is able to link up with regional and global systems.
This  would  facilitate  foreign  trade  and  make  monetary  policy  and  supervision  more  effective.  The
bank is also committed to the steady liberalisation of exchange controls within the CMA. We hope this
initiative  will  contribute  towards  attracting  foreign  portfolio  investments  and  foreign  direct
investment.
My  impression  is  that  the  government  is  eager  to  support  general  growth-oriented  policies.  We  are
also blessed with a high degree of political stability and our basic institutional structures are broadly
up to good standards. However, it is important to recognise that there are severe limitations on what
authorities alone can do to promote sustainable growth. We must recognise that it is individuals, firms
and  markets  that  are  the  most  important  factors  for  generating  economic  growth.  Namibia  needs
individuals with knowledge and ideas to create new concepts and innovations and entrepreneurs that
can  convert  these  ideas  into  successful  businesses.  Physical,  legal  and  financial  infrastructure  must
support and facilitate this conversion.
But that is not enough. Also social  attitudes that  encourage  creativity  and  reasonable  risk-taking  by
new and established enterprises must be built. Recent development strategies are emphasising the role
of “social capital”, meaning the networks and relationships in social interactions that both encourage
trust and mutual support in a society - be it schools, health institutions, rural villages and towns that
will  eventually  filter  through  to  a  national  level.  These  are  factors  that  economists  may  have  some
difficulties to relate to and to analyse, but I believe that they nevertheless are important in the whole
process.
The role of government
Development  and  growth  policies  contain  many  elements,  but  a  statement  in  WB’s  Comprehensive
Development Framework can serve as a summary:
“Structural elements  (which)  include  honest,  competent  governments  committed to  the  fight  against
corruption; strong property and personal rights laws supported by an efficient and honest legal and
judicial system; a well-supervised financial system that promotes transparency; and  a  strong  social
safety net.”
Namibia has in most of these areas come a far way, but there will always be room for improvements.
It should be an achievable goal for Namibia to reach international standards in all these areas.
Although  it  is  difficult  both  theoretically  and  empirically  to  establish  a  clear  relationship  between
growth  and  income  inequality,  this  is  a  problem  that  must  be  addressed  within  a  comprehensive
growth strategy. If we have a situation in which significant low-income groups are unable to acquire
9
BIS Review 104/2000
skills necessary to  participate in  economic  activities, the  society  suffers  a  substantial loss  in  human
capital.  The  Chairman  of  the  US  Federal  Reserve  Board,  Alan  Greenspan,  recently  stated  that:
“Societies  cannot  thrive  when  significant  segments  perceive  its  functioning  as  unjust”.  He  was
referring  to  the  changes  new  technology  is  bringing  about  in  the  US.  This  statement  has  more
relevance for characterising our post-apartheid economy.
Economic  empowerment  of  those  previously  disadvantaged  must  be  addressed  in  a  fair  and
transparent  manner in  order to  build  a foundation for prosperity  and  growth. The same  is  true  with
gender equalities. We can come some way with public disclosure, incentives and moral suasion, but in
my opinion it is not likely that these measures will yield sufficient results in a reasonable length of
time. A suggestion I would like to make is that we should come up with a privatisation strategy that
not only addresses how to deal with potential problems that privatisation may cause in the short run,
but  also  to  address  the  empowerment  of  previously  marginalised  groups  within  our  society.  The
potential for growth of such an initiative is large, but the process must be transparent, open and fair.
Our future growth strategy must also address the HIV/AIDS problem. This is not only a problem in
relation  to  human  suffering,  but  will  also  have  a  macroeconomic  dimension  in  terms  of  reduced
productivity  and  availability  of  productive  human  capital,  skill  shortages,  and  reduced  saving  and
investment. It is estimated that annual real GDP growth may be reduced by more than 1 ½ percentage
point; other estimates that are even more pessimistic. Again, this is not only the sole responsibility of
the government, but the private sector, in particularly employers at all levels, must also contribute.
The role of the private sector
The private sector has to be recognised as a key stakeholder in the development and growth process, as
private investment plays a pivotal role for future growth. The views of the private sector have to be
heard and taken into account by policymakers.
On  the  other  hand,  we  must  also  expect  the  private  sector  to  be  fully  committed  to  the  long-term
development of the country. There are many ways this commitment can be displayed. Disclosure of
corporate  social  investment  in  such  areas  as  on  affirmative  actions,  marginalised  community
empowerment  and  general  skills  development  could  perhaps  be  used  as  one  indicator  of  this
commitment.
It is sometimes argued that the wage structure in Namibia does not reflect the low level of productivity
of  the  unskilled  labour  force  and  that  uncompetitive  wages  have  contributed  to  the  unemployment
problem. In fact, sketchy evidence indicates that unit labour cost in Namibia may be higher than in
many other countries in the region, with the exception of South Africa. We must appeal to the labour
unions that they should not only be concerned with the interest of their employed members, but also
take macroeconomic considerations into account in their wage negotiations. Problems associated with
wage inflexibility, strained labour relations and regulations on hiring and firing may have a bearing on
our competitiveness and growth potential.
The role of the financial sector
The function of financial intermediation is also central in the growth process. It is therefore important
to improve the functioning of money and capital markets in Namibia. The growth process would be
facilitated if financial instruments and prices would be available over a sufficiently wide spectrum of
maturities to satisfy the market players with regard to saving preferences and financing needs.
In this connection, the efforts made by the Bank of Namibia and the Ministry of Finance to develop
more efficient markets for government securities are important. Such markets are not only important
for an effective management of public debt, but well functioning  markets  for  government  securities
will  also  provide  a  basis  for  raising  funds  through  the  issuance  of  securities  by  the  parastatals  and
private sector. The creation of a broader market for securities would channel investable funds by local
institutional investors into productive investments in the Namibian economy. This should contribute to
lower  interest  rates,  as  one  would  expect  that  the  interest  rate  premiums  in  relation  to  comparable
South African government bonds should narrow over time.

I would also like to believe that in the future we should be more active in investigating and addressing
perceived “market failures”. In this connection, we have to consider structural policies that can address
the limited competition in a large part of the financial sector. The authorities and representatives from
the sector should investigate joint actions for decentralising geographically financial services.
We  must  also  recognise  the  fact  that  the  traditional  financial  institutions  and  markets  cannot  be
expected to cater for all financing needs, particularly by smaller and inexperienced future investors.
The role of the financial parastatals will therefore continue to be an important alternative.

Unfortunately, the near-term prospects for economic growth are not very bright, as GDP growth for
the  present  year  will  not  be  significantly  different  from  last  year’s  rate  of  about  3%.  Despite  the
present gloom, however, the recovery in the growth of the economy in the medium term will be that of
a balanced, diversified growth as both the mining and non-mining sectors are expanding. Economic
prospects for the next five years are particularly positive as GDP is projected to grow on average at a
rate  slightly  below  5%  per  year  between  2001  and  2005.  For  the  ensuing  five  years  beyond  2005,
growth is expected to fall to an average of around 4%.
The balance of trade deficit is forecast to deteriorate during the first half of the decade as the terms of
trade will continue  to  deteriorate. This  is  further compounded  by  the  envisaged reduction  in  SACU
revenue. Consequently, the current account of the balance of payments will become negative for the
first  time  since  data  were  recorded.  The  current  account  deficit,  together  with  persistent  capital
outflows, yield a balance of payment shortfall for the large part of the forecasting period, implying that
the internal reserves of the country will be falling. At the end of 1999, the level of reserves was equal
to an import coverage of 8.3 weeks. It should be the authorities’ objective over the next ten years to
increase this coverage.

Public finance
Public finance projections are based on the assumption that the budget deficit for the next ten years
remains at a level of not more than 4% in relation to GDP. Revenue from mining is expected to rise in
the first half of the decade, but this positive trend is likely to be offset by the declining SACU receipts.
Although  the  magnitude  of  the  fall  is  still  being  investigated,  preliminary  evidence  suggests  that
revenue  from  this  source  could  shrink  by  as  much  as  15%  over  the  next  ten  years.  Government
expenditure is forecast to remain stable at the level witnessed during the past two years.

The consequence is a budget deficit continuing at the present level and an upward trend in the overall
debt position of government. Although the ratio of debt as a proportion of GDP should still be within
manageable limits during the next ten years, the pace of its expansion will raise some concerns.

The lack of continuous employment figures makes projections on employment  a  very  difficult  task.
From  the  labour  surveys  in  1991  and  1997  one  can,  however,  deduce  some  general  conclusions.
During this period, productivity increased substantially in the primary sector while the increase was
quite  modest in  the  non-primary  sector.  Assuming  unchanged  productivity  growth  rates  in  both  the
primary and non-primary sectors, total employment has been projected to grow by 2.7% on average to
a level of about 500,000 people at the end of the tenth year period. Using the past average growth in
the  economically  active  population  of  2.4%  gives  rise  to  a  figure  of  751,000  people  that  will  be
economically active at the end of the tenth year. Thus, the result is only a marginal reduction in the
rate of unemployment and underemployment from 35 to about 33% at the end of year 2010.

Conclusion
7.
Although these employment projections should be treated with caution due to the fact that the they are
based on limited data, and also that the impact of HIV/AIDS could significantly alter the picture, the
message  is  clear:  notwithstanding  the  improved  prospects  in  economic  growth  during  the  next  ten
years,  employment  outlook  remains  gloomy.  A  continuation  of  present  policies  is  therefore  not
enough.
The government must continue its effort to expand the development potential of the economy through
pursuance  of  sound  macroeconomic  policies.  We  have  in  this  connection  touched  on  a  number  of
important  challenges,  such  as  improved  efficiency  in  public  spending,  particularly  in  the  education
sector, broadened tax base and tax structure review, including the EPZ arrangement. A comprehensive
privatisation strategy must also be established.
I hope that this presentation has shown that it is not the lack of ideas and good proposals which have
hampered  growth in  our  economy.  Notwithstanding  some  misfortunes  and  limitations  in  the  factors
promoting growth, I also feel that our ability and willingness to act has been part of the problem. As a
nation and individuals we have been too slow when it comes to implementation. Let us all, individuals
and institutions, take personal responsibilities and accept the challenge to promote economic growth,
lest we will continue to be marginalised economically. It is only when we all work together as a nation
that  our  country  can  take  up  its  rightful  economic  position  alongside  other  nations.  We  are  now
starting a new century and we should therefore work hard in order to make a difference.
