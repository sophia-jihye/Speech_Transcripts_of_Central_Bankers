Lars Heikensten: Introduction on monetary policy 
Speech  by  Mr  Lars  Heikensten,  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  to  the  Riksdag  Committee  on 
Finance, Stockholm, 15 March 2005. 
 Allow me as usual to begin by thanking you for your invitation. I think it goes without saying that these 
hearings are a highly valuable feature of the open discussion of monetary policy that we are all keen 
to safeguard. It is also my hope that the hearings can help spread knowledge about monetary policy 
issues to a wider audience, especially since they are now broadcast live on television.  
As is customary at the first hearing of the year I intend to begin by looking back on developments last 
year. As we all know, inflation turned out sharply lower than the Riksbank’s target in 2004. When that 
happens it is natural that a debate on monetary policy should arise in the public domain. It is hardly an 
exaggeration to say that the discussions in the past year have been unusually lively. I commented on 
the debate in detail when I was here in October, but there may be reason to touch upon it again today. 
Subsequently  I  intend  to  present  our  current  assessment  of  the  inflation  outlook  and  explain  the 
interest rate decision we made yesterday, after which I will round off with some general reflections on 
Swedish monetary policy and the conditions under which it operates.  
A look back at 2004 
Developments in 2004 
Sweden’s  economic  performance  in  the  past  year  was  characterised  by  high  growth  coupled  with 
markedly low inflation. Economic growth last year was in actual fact considerably higher than normal; 
in the past 25 years growth has been higher on only six occasions. Even though demand in general 
grew  strongly  in  2004  the  same  cannot  be  said  about  employment.  We  have  yet  to  see  a  clear 
turnaround in the labour market.  
The  Riksbank’s  monetary  policy  decisions  in  2002  and  2003,  which  are  relevant  to  the  inflation 
outcome  in  2004,  were  initially  guided  by  the  measure  of  underlying  inflationary  pressures  that  the 
Bank has used most in recent years, UND1X. In 2003, though, the Bank shifted its focus for a period 
to the measure UND1X excluding energy prices. Inflation according to these measures averaged 0.9 
per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively, in 2004. In terms of the CPI, inflation was 0.5 per cent. The 
fact that CPI inflation turned out significantly lower than the other two measures is essentially because 
the fairly extensive monetary easing that began at the end of 2002 and continued through 2003 and 
into 2004 has kept down households’ mortgage interest expenditure. 
So why was inflation in 2004 so low? In order to get a better picture of one of the causes we need to 
go back to the turn of the year 2002-2003. At that time inflation was pushed up unusually high after 
electricity prices rose to record levels. The Riksbank’s view then was that it was a temporary effect; 
that  electricity  prices  would  fall  back  and  that  the  inflation  rate  would  therefore  come  down  again 
during the year, which it did. As regards CPI and UND1X inflation, that meant that the twelve-month 
change – or the change in relation to the corresponding month a year earlier – fell steeply in early 
2004.  So  the  drop  in  inflation  at  the  start  of  2004  was  partly  an  expected  recoil  of  the  temporary 
increase a year before. (Figure 1). The Riksbank had thus anticipated in early 2003 that CPI inflation 
would undershoot the target in 2004.  
Inflation  was  also  being  depressed  by  low  import  prices.  Imported  producer  prices  have  developed 
weakly  for  a  couple  of  years,  although  they  rose  again  in  2004  partly  because  hikes  in  commodity 
prices pushed up the prices of intermediate goods. As regards consumer prices, inflation on imported 
goods has turned out unexpectedly low for some time. The surprisingly low import prices could be a 
result  of  Swedish  importers  and  producers  buying  from  low-cost  countries  to  a  greater  extent  than 
before,  something  that  is  difficult  to  capture  with  the  measure  that  we  normally  use  to  gauge 
developments in world market prices. The low outcome is most likely also attributable to conditions in 
Sweden, including increased competition in many sectors, not least the retail trade.

This  brings  me  to  a  third  factor  that  has  contributed  to  the  low  inflation,  namely  productivity,  which 
grew stronger than expected by the Riksbank and other forecasters. (Figure 2). This is the other side 
of the unexpectedly weak labour market conditions, which in turn have dampened domestic price and 
wage pressures.  
Neither are the causes of the high productivity growth fully understood. One possible hypothesis is that 
the large-scale IT investment in many sectors at the end of the 1990s is now beginning to pay off. 
Another  theory  argues  that  Sweden  is  a  highly  open  economy  and  thus  strongly  influenced  by  the 
currently rapid integration of low-cost countries into world trade. As regards the developments in both 
productivity and imported inflation there is considerable uncertainty over the strength and durability of 
the present tendencies.  
The Riksbank and unemployment 
As  I  said  earlier  it  is  natural  that  a  debate  on  monetary  policy  should  arise  when  inflation  deviates 
considerably  from  target.  On  this  occasion  the  debate  has  been  fuelled  further  by  the  rise  in 
unemployment in 2003-2004. When I was here in the autumn I devoted a lot of attention to the issue 
of what the Riksbank could do about the unemployment situation. The discussion has continued since 
then.  
It is important to remember that the Riksbank’s objective is price stability. We try to fulfil this objective 
by setting interest rates at a level that enables the general level of demand to grow in line with what 
the economy is able to sustain in the long run without giving rise to inflation, and that ensures that 
economic agents have confidence in the Bank to meet the inflation target. So we only have an indirect 
influence on the general level of demand and employment. And the poorer than expected employment 
conditions  in  the  past  two  years  have  not  been  due  to  developments  in  demand.  On  the  contrary, 
demand has proved surprisingly strong. 
Nonetheless it can of course be maintained that employment could have been somewhat higher if the 
Riksbank had kept interest rates lower, something that would have been possible given what we now 
know  about  inflation.  It  is  difficult  to  object  to  this  assertion,  which  of  course  is  why  the Riksbank’s 
critics keep coming back to it. But an assessment of what we could or could not have done must be 
based on what we knew when the decisions were made, not on what we know now. One way to try to 
approach  this  issue  is  to  compare  our  assessments  and  actions  with  other  players’  forecasts  and 
opinions on policy at the time in question. 
The Inflation Report that we published today shows that the economic and inflation outlook on which 
the Riksbank based its monetary policy in 2002-2003 was in no way significantly different from that 
held by other leading forecasters of the Swedish economy during this period. (Figure 3). If anything it 
seems that the Riksbank was one of the most successful forecasters, or perhaps rather one of the 
least unsuccessful, although it also has to be remembered that our forecasts, unlike others’, had been 
based on the assumption of an unchanged repo rate. 
Part of the recent monetary policy debate has seen our forecasts compared with those of the National 
Institute of Economic Research (NIER). It turns out, however, that the NIER’s view of the appropriate 
repo rate path has not differed more than marginally from the Riksbank’s. (Figure 4). On average the 
NIER recommended a repo rate that was barely 0.2 percentage points lower. Given the effects that 
one generally expects from monetary policy, inflation in 2004 would only have been marginally closer 
to the target if we had followed the NIER’s recommendations. Nor would we have had more than a 
very slight impact on employment. The point is that the differences in opinion regarding future inflation 
and the stance of monetary policy have been small in relation to the drop in inflation and the rise in 
unemployment.  
To sum up, we can conclude that the low inflation outcome in 2004 cannot be attributed to a monetary 
policy  that  was  contrary  to  the  consensus  view  at  the  time.  Instead,  it  was  essentially  a  result  of 
developments  that  practically  nobody  managed  to  foresee.  Another  possible  conclusion  is  that  we 
would have had to conduct a dramatically different monetary policy if inflation was to have turned out 
much closer to the target in 2004. For example, the Riksbank would probably have had to cut the repo 
rate  rapidly  and  sharply  at  the  beginning  of  2002.  Such  a  stance  would  most  likely  have  caused 
something of a stir. Inflation was high at that time and nobody predicted the kind of dramatic decline 
that would have justified a substantial rate cut. To give you an idea of the sentiment at the time, one of 
the country’s leading trade union representatives warned us not to take the inflation target lightly.

Has policy been asymmetrical? 
One recurrent feature of the recent discussion is claims that the Riksbank is more concerned about 
high inflation than low inflation. It has been said that inflation since the introduction of the Bank’s target 
– from 1995 onwards – has turned out somewhat below target on average.  
Personally, I can understand fears that central banks could be ”overly zealous” in their fight against 
inflation, especially if a country has experience of a high-inflation regime, as is the case in Sweden. 
Such risks have also been one of the arguments in favour of opening the Riksbank to scrutiny and of 
promoting a policy that is as clear as possible. An open debate and good opportunities to scrutinise 
the Bank appear to me to be the best antidote against an introverted and exaggerated inflation-fighting 
perspective. 
Having said that, though, I think that there is every reason to object to the recurrent interpretation that 
the low inflation is an expression of an excessively hawkish stance on the part of the Riksbank. Firstly, 
for a large part of the period in question monetary policy has been guided by a measure of underlying 
inflation  UND1X,  and  so  policy  should  first  and  foremost  be  evaluated  in  terms  of  this  measure,  in 
accordance  with  the  Bank’s  clarification  in  1999.  UND1X  inflation  has  averaged  1.9  per  cent  since 
1995, which is undeniably quite close to the target. (Figure 5). The fact that CPI inflation during this 
period has been lower – 1.4 per cent – is mainly due to the sharp decline seen in the general level of 
interest rates, partly because a low-inflation environment has been secured. Furthermore, ten years 
may be too short a period over which to assess policy, at least when a number of those years have 
involved an adjustment from one regime to another, as in Sweden’s case.  
Another  way  to  approach  this  issue  is  to  study  the  episodes  when  inflation  has  undershot  the 
Riksbank’s target. That has mainly happened on three occasions. On the first of these, 1996-1997, a 
high level of interest rates in the previous years had without doubt contributed to both a drop in the 
general level of demand and to low inflation. The period was also characterised by an occasionally 
heated debate on monetary policy. The reason the Riksbank decided to keep policy tight at the time 
was that credibility for inflation-targeting had not yet been established.  
The  two  subsequent  periods,  1998-1999  and  2004,  were  completely  different.  On  both  these 
occasions the repo rate had been relatively low the years before at the same time as the general level 
of demand was growing fast. The main factors generating the low inflation were changes on the supply 
side of the economy: deregulation, lower import prices and surprisingly rapid productivity growth. The 
Bank’s policy had hardly been called into question at all when it was conducted in 1996-1997; it was 
only in retrospect that the criticism came, and this has largely been the pattern in recent times, as I 
mentioned earlier. If one wants to argue that the Riksbank has systematically conducted excessively 
tight  policy  one  should  reasonably  be  able  to  show  that  other  forecasters  called  the  Bank’s  policy 
strongly into question when it was formulated.  
So, in my opinion, there are on the whole fairly natural explanations for why inflation on average has 
been  somewhat  below  target  over  the  past  ten-year  period.  It  is  not  because  the  Riksbank  has 
considered deviations below target to be less serious than deviations above target; instead, it is partly 
because  we  have  undergone  an  adjustment  from  a  high-inflation  to  a  low-inflation  regime,  which 
affected policy in large measure during the first of those three episodes, and partly because inflation 
on different occasions has been depressed by supply factors that neither we nor others have been 
able to predict.  
Allow me to conclude the retrospective part of this speech by underlining that I value an open, lively 
debate  on  monetary  policy.  I  have  previously  pointed  out  before  the  Committee  that  we  would  be 
happy to come here more often and that we are open to other forms of discussion than this one. If the 
Committee’s members have ideas to improve the material that we present, we would be interested in 
hearing them. The Riksbank is also considering initiating an annual forum for monetary policy debate, 
where our assessments and policy can be discussed against the background of regular independent 
evaluations of the forecasts that we – and other participants in the general debate – have produced. 
The current assessment 
Cyclical upswing continuing 
With  that  I  shall  now  look  forward  and  briefly  discuss  the  assessment  of  economic  and  inflation 
prospects in our latest Inflation Report and the decision we took yesterday regarding the repo rate. 
BIS Review 18/2005

As  usual  I  shall  begin  with  a  brief  look  at  the  international  situation.  Economic  growth  abroad  has 
remained  high.  There  are  many  indications  that  international  economic  activity  will  continue  to 
strengthen  in  the  period  ahead and  that  resource  utilisation will  gradually  pick up.  High  productivity 
growth and weak resource utilisation have kept down cost developments in a number of industrialised 
countries.  Coupled  with  the  increased  integration  of  low-cost  countries  into  world  trade  this  has 
contributed to low global inflationary pressures. In the period ahead, price pressures are expected to 
remain  modest  even  though  they  will  increase  as  economic  conditions  improve  and  there  is  a 
reduction in spare production capacity. That means that market interest rates are also anticipated to 
rise  from  today’s  unusually  low  levels.  There  are  positive  signals  emanating  from  the  US  economy 
while the euro area, and notably Germany, has seen somewhat weaker growth than expected. (Figure 
6.) Overall, growth in Sweden’s export markets is forecast to be largely the same as in the previous 
Inflation Report.  
The  Swedish  economic  recovery  began  in  2003  and  it  is  predicted  to  continue  during  the  forecast 
period.  In  2004  robust  international  demand  for  Swedish  exports  contributed  to  the  high  economic 
growth. Manufacturing activity now appears to be entering a slightly slower phase. Indicators and data 
point  to  a  continuation  of  firm,  healthy  growth,  albeit  at  a  somewhat  lower  rate  than  in  early  2004. 
Growth in domestic demand is assumed to increase while the contribution to aggregate demand from 
net  exports  will  diminish.  (Table  1).  In  2005  business  investment  and  private  consumption  are 
anticipated  to  account  for  the  majority  of  the  pick-up  in  demand.  Compared  with  the  December 
Inflation Report the forecast for GDP growth in 2005 has been revised up marginally to 3.2 per cent, 
mainly  due  to  higher  investment  and  increased  services  trade.  Towards  the  end  of  last  year 
investment  in  the  economy  grew  more  than  expected  and  there  is  much  to  suggest  that  the  fast 
increase will continue in early 2005.  
Despite last year’s robust productivity growth the number of employed fell for the second consecutive 
year. The fact that firms were able to boost output so sharply without hiring new staff was due to a rise 
in both productivity and average working time. It is reasonable to believe, though, that a continuation 
of strong GDP growth will result in higher employment during the forecast period. Different indicators 
from  the  labour  market  also  suggest  that  a  turnaround  is  on  the  way.  For  example,  the  number  of 
temporary employees has risen since summer 2004 and the number of new job vacancies reported to 
Swedish  employment  offices  rose  in  annual  terms  in  the  period  November-January  after  having 
dropped for almost two years in a row.  
There is reason to expect average productivity growth in the economy to decrease somewhat as the 
economic upswing continues. Nevertheless, the Riksbank’s assessment remains that there has been 
a lasting increase in the rate of productivity growth, and the Bank’s forecasts for the coming years are 
therefore  relatively  high  in  a  longer  historical  perspective.  The  forecast  for domestic cost  pressures 
this year has been revised down somewhat all the same compared with the assessment in December 
on the basis of new data for 2004.  
Resource utilisation in the Swedish economy was low last year. In particular, the demand for labour is 
still  limited  even  though  some  indicators  of  labour  shortages  show  an  upward  tendency.  Indicators 
from  manufacturing  also  suggest  that  capacity  utilisation  has  picked  up  recently.  The  Riksbank’s 
overall assessment is that resource utilisation has risen – albeit from a low level – and will continue to 
increase as more and more spare resources are put to use.  
The inflation outlook 
As I mentioned, both domestic and imported inflation were low in the past year. Domestic inflation was 
expected to be low at this point in time and the rate of price increases for domestically produced goods 
in recent months has also been broadly in line with the Bank’s previous forecast. In spite of this, the 
forecasts for domestic inflation this year and next year have been revised down. One reason is that 
the downward pressure on prices in the retail food trade is anticipated to be greater than previously 
assumed. How big the effects will be is difficult to say, though, as is their significance for the general 
inflation rate in the longer term. Over a longer horizon, domestic inflation is expected as before to rise 
gradually as the cyclical upswing continues and resource utilisation picks up. 
Imported inflation has recently turned out lower than we anticipated in the previous Inflation Report. 
There are several reasons for this, which I touched upon earlier. For instance, increased imports from 
low-wage countries appear to have led to greater downward price pressure than previously forecast 
even  though  these  projections  were  optimistic  about  price  developments  for  imported  goods.  The 
4 
 BIS Review 18/2005
price-dampening factors are also estimated to affect imported inflation in the period ahead, and the 
forecast has therefore been revised down both for this year and next.  
The effects of the factors that have resulted in falling prices of imported goods in the past year are 
expected  to  gradually  subside,  however.  It  is  reasonable  to  believe  that  rising  global  resource 
utilisation will lead to higher international price pressures. In addition, a gradual pick-up in domestic 
resource utilisation and mounting cost pressures are forecast to contribute to larger price increases for 
imported goods and services as well.  
All in all, the forecasts for domestic and imported inflation mean that the forecast for UND1X inflation 
has  been  revised  down  compared  with  the  Inflation  Report  in  December.  (Figure  7.)  Both  imported 
inflation and domestic price pressures are expected to be lower mainly in the near term but also during 
the  latter  part  of  the  forecast  period.  The  downward  revision  for the  coming  year  is  not  due  to  any 
change in the assessment of economic prospects, but rather to a number of specific factors that have 
resulted  in  higher  competition  in  the  world  market  and  in  Sweden.  But  as  the  cyclical  upswing 
continues and firms’ costs increase, there is still assumed to be a gradual rise in inflation. In the main 
scenario, which is based on an unchanged repo rate in the coming two years, both CPI and UND1X 
inflation  is  expected  to be  on  target  two  years ahead.  The  annual  averages  for  inflation will  be  low 
throughout the forecast period, however.  
Allow me in this context to briefly say something about the fact that the weak price developments in 
the recent period have caused the word ”deflation” to reappear in the media, often in the form of an 
eye-catching headline. There is always reason to keep the risk of deflation in mind, since falls in the 
general  price  level  are  sometimes  associated  with  considerable  problems  in  the  economy.  It  is 
important,  however,  to  ascertain  whether  the  subdued  price  developments  are  a  result  of  weak 
demand or due to positive changes on the supply side of the economy. At the moment there is no 
doubt that the latter is the dominant factor. If a pair of jeans becomes cheaper because the dollar has 
fallen, or the price of plasma TVs has been halved because their production has increased in China, or 
the  price  of  food  goes  down  because  the  competition  in  the  retail  food  trade  has  toughened,  it  is 
something that we essentially should be happy about. But should there be a sharp fall in demand then 
the situation would be completely different of course.  
So  what  risks  do  we  see  that  could  cause  inflation  to  deviate  from  the  path  in  the  main  scenario? 
There are a number of risks in the inflation assessment that have been in focus for some time, e.g. the 
twin deficits in the US economy, the developments in the Swedish krona, and productivity growth. In 
addition, new risks have emerged in connection to specific factors, such as the developments in food 
prices, and these are creating great uncertainty over how inflation will be affected in the period ahead 
– not least in the short run. 
Compared with the previous Inflation Report the main scenario on this occasion has taken account of 
the downside risks to inflation to a greater extent; e.g. increased international, as well as domestic, 
competition  is  now  forecast  to  have  a  somewhat  bigger  impact  on  Swedish  prices  than  previously 
assumed.  There  are  arguments,  however,  that  this  could  nevertheless  entail  an  underestimation  of 
inflation as much as an overestimation. That was shown, for instance, by the latest price data released 
last Friday, where the inflation outcome for February was actually a little higher than the forecast in the 
Inflation Report that we published today. Individual monthly figures for inflation are difficult to forecast, 
however, and next month the forecast could just as easily overshoot the outcome.  
In the main scenario productivity is also assumed to follow the normal cyclical pattern, but just like the 
effects of the international competition there are arguments to suggest that this pattern may imply an 
underestimation  or  overestimation  of  the  future  trend.  The  overall  assessment  of  the  different  risk 
factors is that the risk outlook is balanced, i.e. that the risks of inflation turning out higher than in the 
main scenario are as large as the risks of inflation turning out lower. Thus, the balance of risks does 
not change our assessment. Inflation in the coming two years will be low, coming into line with the 
target at the end of the forecast period. 
Some considerations 
The point of departure for our discussion about the future path of the repo rate is the assessment of 
inflation prospects in the coming years that I just presented. Allow me in this context to point out that 
the  Riksbank  does  not  conduct  monetary  policy  according  to  a  mechanical  rule,  even  though  that 
sometimes seems to be the perception. There are also other aspects than inflation one to two years 
ahead that must be taken into account when setting the repo rate. 
BIS Review 18/2005

Last year we encountered a similar situation to that today, when the Bank's forecasts suggested that 
inflation would undershoot the target for almost the entire two-year period ahead, even though it was 
estimated to be on target in two years’ time. One reason we decided not to cut rates then – a reason 
that is still valid today – was that we saw that demand was growing strongly already. So, monetary 
policy  appeared  to  have  had  the  desired  effect.  This  development  has  been  reinforced  now  that 
business investment seems to have begun to pick up in earnest and that private consumption is also 
stronger. In other words, economic activity is already firm and GDP growth is above what is judged to 
be sustainable in the long term. Given that, a rate cut now would probably mean in practice that we 
would have to tighten policy more quickly in the future. So it is a question of trying to avoid excessive 
fluctuations in the real economy and interest rates. 
Another, partly related aspect that we also have reason to consider when making decisions about the 
repo rate is that the low inflation is due in large measure to markedly weak price developments for 
certain products as a result of increased competition, e.g. in the retail food trade and textile industry. It 
is  probably  not  always  prudent  to  fully  counter  this  through  highly  loose  policy  that  would  drive  up 
domestic  demand.  Should  that  price  outlook  change,  we  may  find  that  excessively  high  price 
pressures have been established, which may then prove difficult to break. It remains to be seen how 
long  the  effects  on  inflation  of  the  price  cuts  for  certain  products  will  last.  This  argument,  too,  can 
essentially  be  said  to  involve  an  ambition  to  avoid  excessive  swings  in  interest  rates  and  the  real 
economy.  
Yet another factor that has been discussed for some time by the Executive Board is the rapid growth 
in  household  debt  and  the  increases  in  house  prices.  A  number  of  commentators  have  begun  to 
highlight risks in this area. We have previously concluded that the developments are not a cause for 
great concern. Even though that largely remains our assessment, it has gradually become clearer that 
the developments in credit and house prices are one argument against looser monetary policy. A rate 
cut  followed  by  a  faster  hike  could  bring  about  problems  through  their  effects  on  household 
indebtedness and consumption. 
The inflation assessment I presented earlier indicates that inflation will be in line with the target at the 
end of the two-year period on which we normally focus. At the same time the issues that I have just 
discussed  give  cause  for  a  certain  amount  of  caution  in  interest  rate  policy  in  line  with  the  Bank’s 
clarification of monetary policy in 1999. All in all, the arguments I have put forward advocate leaving 
the repo rate unchanged, which was also the decision we took yesterday.   
As usual there is reason to underline that even though this is our assessment today conditions can of 
course change in the period ahead. A lot can happen: the imbalances in the United States could result 
in  financial  unease  that  sharply  curtails  the  international  economic  upswing,  or  the  credit  and  debt 
developments in Sweden may prove considerably more worrisome than foreseen today. We may also 
find that we have overestimated or underestimated the impact on inflation of changes in competitive 
pressures. So, claims in the media that the Riksbank has closed the door on a particular course of 
action in the future are misleading as usual. 
Concluding remarks 
Allow me to conclude with a few general reflections on the conditions under which monetary policy 
operates  and  regarding  the  expectations  one  can  have  on  it.  Even  though  developments  since  the 
shift in policy regime in the early 1990s have been remarkably good this has, as we now know, neither 
stopped inflation from occasionally deviating sharply from target nor prevented output and employment 
from fluctuating somewhat.  
What  is  important  to  realise  is  that  there  are  always  going  to  be  fast  changes  in  the  economy  and 
inflation that cannot be foreseen nor fully offset in the short run. No central bank can therefore have 
full control over inflation and economic activity over time. What monetary policy should normally be 
able to achieve is to ensure that inflation over a number of years is fairly well in line with the inflation 
target.  This  should  also  improve  the  chances  of  ensuring  stable  developments  in  demand  in  the 
economy. That in turn should help smooth the fluctuations in the cyclical component of unemployment, 
even  though  the  relationship  between  demand  and  unemployment  does  not  always  have  to  be 
especially strong, as demonstrated in particular by recent developments. 
It is just as important to realise that monetary policy, and for that matter stabilisation policy in general, 
cannot  be  used  to  permanently  raise  growth  and  reduce  unemployment.  If  the  aim  is  to  achieve  a 
permanently higher employment rate and lower unemployment, it is essentially a question instead of 
6 
 BIS Review 18/2005
trying  to  influence  the  structural  component  of  unemployment,  i.e.  the  component  that  does  not 
depend  on  fluctuations  in  demand  for  goods  and  services  in  the  economy.  And  that  requires 
completely different measures than those of monetary policy. Examples include how to improve the 
business climate and how to make the labour market as efficient as possible.  
It  is  vital  to  discuss  and  evaluate  monetary  policy,  but  it  is  also  important  that  the  discussion  of 
economic policy and developments on the whole be based on a realistic view of what monetary policy 
can accomplish. If so, the discussion is more likely to help us in our efforts to conduct monetary policy 
in the best way possible. 
Thank you.
