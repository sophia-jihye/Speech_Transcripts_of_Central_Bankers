Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Monetary and financial policies in the Asian network economy 
Introductory  remarks  by  Dr  Zeti  Akhtar  Aziz,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Malaysia,  at  the  Tun 
Ismail  Ali  Chair  Public  Lecture  by  Datuk  Seri  Panglima  Andrew  Sheng  on  “Monetary  and  Financial 
Policies in the Asian Network Economy”, Kuala Lumpur, 18 April 2006. 
 Introduction  
Let me first of all welcome you to the Tun Ismail Ali Public Lecture for 2006. This Public Lecture is part 
of a series of events organised in conjunction with the Tun Ismail Ali Chair in Monetary and Financial 
Economics  at  the  University  of  Malaya.  The  Chair  was  established  by  Bank  Negara  Malaysia  in 
August 2000 to commemorate the contributions of the late Tun Ismail Mohamed Ali, the first Malaysian 
Governor of Bank Negara Malaysia . It is our hope that this Chair would contribute to the advancement 
of new ideas and knowledge in the area of monetary and financial economics.  
Today, we are indeed honoured to have Datuk Seri Panglima Andrew Sheng, holder of the Tun Ismail 
Ali Chair for 2006, to speak to us on "Monetary and Financial Policies in the Asian Network Economy". 
This occasion is particularly meaningful because Andrew was with Bank Negara Malaysia for many 
years, from 1976 â€“ 89, and during that period, he had worked closely with the late Tun Ismail Ali.  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
The  theme  for  today's  Public  Lecture:  "Monetary  and  Financial  Policies  in  the  Asian  Network 
Economy" is indeed timely and highly relevant, in  the current regional and global environment. The 
Asian economies have always been highly integrated into the global economic and financial network. 
Indeed, the success of the Asian economies lies essentially in its ability to be highly networked. The 
nature of these networks however, has evolved over time, heightening the complex nature of the inter-
linkages.  
In this recent decade, this trend is being reinforced by the intensification of regional integration. It is 
being  facilitated  by  increased  liberalisation  and  the  increased  potential  for  complementarities  in  the 
region. It is also driven by the conscious efforts by the authorities to facilitate the integration process. 
This is premised on the potential for increasingly mutually reinforcing positive outcomes.  
There  is  a  growing  recognition  of  the  need  for  enhancements  to the  institutional  arrangements  and 
regulatory  and  legal  framework  to  better  manage  the  risks  and  vulnerabilities  associated  with  the 
network  economy.  In  this  regard,  an  enhanced  understanding  of  the  changes  in  the  way  financial 
markets and payment systems operate in a more connected environment becomes important. As part 
of this process is the support provided by an enhanced surveillance mechanism. A further implication 
of a more networked economy is i n the area of payments, clearing and settlement systems, in which 
the  benefits  are  derived  from  the  economies  of  scale  and  the  positive  network  externalities  of 
increased participation. Inevitably, payment networks could become more interconnected and a single 
and large payment network could emerge. It then becomes essential to be in a position to manage the 
risks that may emanate from places beyond national boundaries. There has to be then a high level of 
preparedness against any disruption in the flow of information, funds and securities becomes vital.  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
The policy response  
How have these developments changed the way Bank Negara Malaysia operates?  
In Malaysia , efforts are currently being taken on several fronts to meet the challenges arising from 
these  trends.  These  range  from  structural  enhancements  to  the  macro  surveillance  systems,  to 
strengthening  of  the  robustness  and  capacity  of  financial  players,  in  addition  to  promoting  greater 
understanding of the intricacies of the interconnectivity, and the nature and speed of contagion risks 
within the overall system.  
On the regulatory front, closer regulatory oversight is particularly important in ensuring the strength of 
the  risk  management  framework  of  large  and  complex  financial  institutions  that  are  active  in  cross-
border transactions. Towards this end, Bank Negara Malaysia is enhancing its prudential framework 
for  the  management  of  operational  risks  among  such  financial  institutions,  with  the  introduction  of

sound practices. The Bank's prudential framework has also been refined and enhanced to ensure that 
financial  institutions  address  the  risk  management  implications  of  new  financial  products,  including 
credit  derivatives,  credit  default  swaps,  credit  linked  notes  and  collateralised  debt  obligations.  In 
addition, the introduction of the Payment System Act in 2003 provided Bank Negara Malaysia with a 
broader scope on the oversight function over payment systems and instruments that are operated or 
issued by banks or non-banks, given that advances in ICT have increased the participation of non-
banking institutions in the payments system. The Bank has therefore put in place a specific legislative 
authority to institute more comprehensive and effective mechanisms for achieving effective oversight 
of the payments system in a networked environment.  
Bank Negara Malaysia also maintains very close contacts with its counterparts in other jurisdictions to 
keep  abreast  of  developments  in  the  financial  markets.  Strengthened  surveillance  and  information 
sharing  on  a  real-time  basis  has  become  key.  Cooperation  among  the  Asian  central  banks  is  very 
strong,  and  there  are  various  avenues  for  increased  interface  for  collaboration  at  all  levels  in  the 
regional central banks.  
To maintain effective surveillance, importance is also placed on regular engagement with the financial 
market participants, the industry and the public. An emerging dimension in the changing environment 
is  to  strengthen  Central  Bank  communications.  The  aim  is  to  enhance  market  understanding  and 
awareness of the benefits as well as the potential risks and the policy initiatives in a network economy. 
The regular publication of the Bank's Monetary Policy Statement is to appraise markets of the direction 
of  monetary  policy.  Other  measures  include  outreach  programmes  on  investor  and  consumer 
education to enhance financial literacy.  
Finally,  Bank  Negara  Malaysia  has  also  put  in  place  business  continuity  plans  as  part  of  its 
contingency  programme  to  deal  with  all  eventualities  and  threats  to  financial  stability,  in  particular, 
those emanating from a more networked financial system. Similar contingency plans have also been 
introduced  in  the  domestic  financial  industry,  where  regular  test-runs  are  conducted  to  ensure  the 
integrity of all the back-up systems.  
Going forward, Central Bank cooperation continues to be enhanced to strengthen risk management 
capabilities 
is 
complemented  by  cooperation  on  regional  surveillance  mechanisms  to  provide  comprehensive 
oversight over the entire regional network. Closer cooperation with the respective regulators is also 
important  to  promote  greater  understanding  of  the  nature  of  the  risks  involved  and  to  facilitate  the 
development of appropriate circuit breakers and mechanisms to contain the risks in the network.  
In  addition  to  the  establishment  of  Business  Continuity  Plans  to  help  to  mitigate  risks  arising  from 
outside the financial network, the harmonisation of regulatory and financial standards would facilitate 
the containment process. These cooperative efforts to harmonise standards are to support financial 
infrastructure development in facilitating the flow of funds and settlement requirements across borders.

Conclusion  
Datuk Seri Panglima Andrew Sheng's lecture today will explore the behaviour of markets as networks, 
and the implications of such network behavior on monetary and financial stability in the Asian network 
economy.  Going  forward,  it  can  be  expected  that  the  Asian  networked  economy  will  become 
increasingly more entrenched. While this will open up new opportunities for enhanced efficiency and 
productivity gains in Asia, a better understanding of the risks inherent in networks will better prepare 
the regional economies to address these risks. This will be a shared responsibility within and among 
the regional economies. Closer regional cooperation, strategic alliances and smart partnerships will be 
important key responses for enhancing the prospects for higher growth and development in Asia.  
Thank you.
