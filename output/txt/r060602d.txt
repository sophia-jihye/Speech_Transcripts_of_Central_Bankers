Paul Tucker: Uncertainty, the implementation of monetary policy, and the 
management of risk 
Speech by Mr Paul Tucker, Executive Director and Member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the 
Bank of England, at the Association of Corporate Treasurers, Newport, 19 May 2006.  
 Many of us would probably say that we do not much like uncertainty, whether at work or home. But we 
cannot escape it, and it provides opportunities. Rather, we want to be compensated for the risk, or to 
mitigate it, or both. 
What  I  think  we  actively  dislike  is  avoidable  uncertainty.  And  from  the  point  of  view  of  society,  we 
should dislike uncertainties that are both avoidable and especially costly to mitigate for those who bear 
the consequent risks.  
I am going to discuss some sources of avoidable uncertainty – or volatility – that have affected you as 
corporate treasurers. And I will discuss some unavoidable sources of uncertainty, and what they might 
mean for risk management, at the level of firms and of the financial system as a whole.  
Avoidable uncertainties: the monetary regime, and the implementation of monetary policy 
For  too  many  years  in  the  UK,  we  lived  with  a  large  but  avoidable  element  of  macroeconomic 
uncertainty. It was unclear what rate of inflation households and businesses should expect to prevail 
over the medium-to-long run. In other words, it was unclear what policymakers were trying to achieve; 
whether their goals shifted about; and whether policy makers would succeed in delivering those goals. 
That was resolved progressively during the 1990s, culminating in the Government’s announcement in 
1997 that an operationally independent Bank of England was charged with achieving a clear inflation 
target. A stable monetary environment has reduced the quite unnecessary risk of self-induced ‘boom 
and bust’ flipping about demand conditions across the economy as whole. 
For  users  of  financial  markets,  the  most  visible  sign  of  the  change  was  the  reduction  in  yields  on 
conventional government bonds with long maturities, which had previously compensated for high and 
highly uncertain prospective inflation rates. By ushering in a world with a credible nominal anchor, one 
source of uncertainty and risk was significantly reduced. The ex post annualised volatility of ten year 
gilt yields has halved: from over 200 basis points between 1970 and 1997, to under 100 basis points 
since the current monetary regime was introduced (Table 1).  
That means that, as corporate treasurers, one source of unavoidable uncertainty about your long-run 
borrowing costs has been very significantly reduced.  
The  introduction  of  the  new  monetary  regime  did  not,  and  of  course  could  not,  remove  uncertainty 
about the quarter-to-quarter, or indeed year-to-year, path of the economy and inflation. And so there 
remains  a  degree  of  unavoidable  uncertainty  about  the  short-term  path  of  official  rates,  as  the 
Monetary  Policy  Committee  responds  to  cyclical  developments.  Transparency  can  reduce  that 
uncertainty, through our making clear what we think is going on in the economy and how, generally, 
we react to changes in the outlook. We do that through the minutes of our monthly meetings and the 
quarterly  Inflation  Report;  and,  in  terms  of  our  individual  analyses,  through  speeches,  etc.  But,  like 
anybody else,  we  cannot predict with certainty what  will happen in  the economy.  There  are  always 
material risks around the central outlook. We have to weigh those risks in our policy decisions in much 
the same way as you do in your business and financing decisions. 
In the midst of all this unavoidable uncertainty, however, a few things are not in doubt. The MPC’s 
official interest rate is certain. So there should be no uncertainty about the general level of overnight 
rates in the money markets. In fact, though, overnight rates in the UK have historically been highly 
volatile. Various steps taken over the past decade or so moderated that volatility – with some success; 
it has for some while been much lower than in the mid-1990s (Chart 1). But it has remained greater – 
from day to day, and during the day – than overnight rates in dollars, euros etc (Charts 2 and 3).  
That has created uncertainty for users of the sterling money markets – banks, asset managers and, of 
course, corporate treasurers. Avoidable uncertainty.

It is the Bank of England’s responsibility to remove that uncertainty as much as we possibly can. And 
yesterday,  after  more  than  three  years’  preparation  and  extensive  collaboration  with  market 
participants, we introduced a completely modernised system to do just that. 
It  provides  a  new  framework  for  the  Bank’s  implementation  of  monetary  policy;  our  operational 
engagement with the banking system; and for the sterling money markets.  
I  shall  spare  you  the  details,  but  I  do  want  to  sketch  the  main  features  of  the  system,  by  way  of 
underlining that it is directly relevant to you as corporate treasurers. I am keen that you should hear 
this directly from the Bank.  
For as long as anyone can remember, a small group of clearing banks – which these days we call 
‘settlement  banks’  –  have  had  to  balance  their  books  with  the  Bank  at  the  close  of  business  each 
evening. Volatility resulted if the Bank had not provided pretty well exactly the amount of liquidity the 
banking  system  as  a  whole  needed  each  day;  or  if  our  money  was  not  distributed  in  the  money 
markets to those banks that were short. And traders would speculate on that volatility – perhaps a rare 
instance of financial market activity with little social utility. 
The new system relaxes the overnight constraint and liberalises access to the Bank. A broader group 
of  banks  –  initially  just  over  40,  accounting  for  around  90%  of  the  UK  banking  system’s  sterling 
liabilities  –  will  maintain  a  target  balance  with  the  Bank  on  average  over  each  month.  (In  the  first 
maintenance period, which started yesterday, the target is just under £23bn.) These reserve-scheme 
banks, and other banks who so choose, also have access to a standing deposit facility and a standing 
(secured) lending facility. At a modest penalty to the Bank’s policy rate, they can use those facilities in 
unlimited amounts, and so can turn to them if the rate in the market threatens to be less attractive. 
Together, this should keep the market rate in line with our policy rate. 
Indeed,  our  objectives  have  been  fourfold.  First,  to  stabilise  overnight  market  rates  in  line  with  the 
MPC  rate.  Second,  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  framework  for  banking  system  liquidity 
management  in  normal  conditions,  and  to  make  it  more  resilient  in  stressed  conditions.  Third,  to 
simplify our method of implementing monetary policy. And fourth, to foster efficient and fair markets. 
For too long, too many people have been deterred from using the short-term sterling markets as much 
as  they  might  because  it  seemed  to  required  special  expertise,  and  therefore  a  disproportionate 
commitment of resources.  
Judging  by  the  ACT’s  very  positive  response  to  one  of  the  Bank’s  early  consultation  papers,  the 
modernisation  of  our  framework  should  be  helpful  to  companies,  which  of  course  use  the  money 
markets to borrow, employ cash balances, and manage risk.  
At the end of last year, firms’ short-term sterling borrowing in the UK was around £300 bn. There are 
no data on how much of that was at very short maturities, but there is anecdotal evidence of overnight 
volatility acting as a deterrent. For example, when in late 2004 the Bank announced our intention to 
introduce  reforms,  the  European  treasury  department  of  one  of  the  largest  companies  in  the  world 
wrote to me in the following terms:  
“I write to express our support and appreciation ….. The excessive volatility in the 
overnight  market  precluded  high-quality  issuers  ..  from  participating.  …The  steps 
you  are  taking  will  surely  increase  the  depth,  stability  and  overall  liquidity  of  the 
sterling money market.”  
That kind of support has been a great encouragement.  
In terms of risk management, many companies swap fixed-rate term borrowing (and other cash flows) 
into  floating-rate.  This  can  be  into  a  six  or  three-month  LIBOR  rate  of  interest,  or  into  a  stream  of 
payments linked to the overnight money market rate. In the UK, the Overnight-Index-Swap market has 
developed  rather  less  than  its  counterpart  in  the  euro  area,  which  is  used  by  large  non-financial 
companies. One obstacle seems to have been the intra-day volatility in the sterling market, which has 
entailed uncertainty about the spread between the average overnight rate on any particular day (as 
measured  by  the  Sterling  Overnight  Rate  Index  Average,  or  SONIA)  and  the  rate  actually  paid  on 
overnight cash at different times during the day. Many market participants believe that if the reforms 
introduced yesterday significantly reduce intra-day volatility, the sterling OIS swap market will grow, 
making it a more useful risk management tool.  
The  evidence  of  corporate  treasurers  as  placers  of  short-term  money  is  more  concrete.  For  a  few 
years now, UK companies’ domestic operations have been producing surplus cash flows: £12bn, or 
2 
 BIS Review 47/2006
about 1% of GDP, in 2005. The counterpart has, of course, been an accumulation of financial assets. 
A  lot  of  that  has gone  in  to  the  money  markets –  in  particular,  holdings  of call-deposits  with  banks 
(Chart 4) and investments in money market funds. In placing that liquidity, you should be in a position 
where  you  need  to  negotiate  only  the  spread  paid  relative  to  a  stable  money  market  rate,  not  the 
underlying rate itself. Our overhaul of the system should deliver that. 
By taking the noise out of the sterling money markets, we aim to achieve greater stability and greater 
transparency.  That  won’t  revolutionise  your  businesses,  but  I  trust  that  it  will  bring  a  welcome 
reduction in the avoidable uncertainties you confront.  
Business risk management and pension-scheme uncertainties 
At  an  aggregate  level,  the  recent  financial  management  of  the  company  sector  has,  in  fact,  posed 
some  puzzles  about  your  assessment  of  uncertainty  and  risk.  This  has  been  important  to  our 
understanding of what is going on in the money markets, and indeed financial markets more generally, 
as part of the backdrop to our role of promoting monetary and financial stability. 
The surplus cash flows I described earlier, in the context of your treasury management, are a product 
of UK cash profits having exceeded, by some margin, business investment (Chart 5).  
The  same  is  true  across  the  G7  economies  as  a  whole.  Companies  have  acted  to  repair  balance 
sheets following the excesses of the late 1990s, and may conceivably have built a cushion of financial 
assets to support them through a period of uncertainty as they adjust to the new competitive forces 
associated with globalisation. But the UK corporate sector stands out as having employed its surplus 
in ‘cash’ to a far greater extent than its G7 peers (Chart 6). 
The IMF hypothesise1 that this may have been motivated by a desire to accumulate a precautionary 
pot of liquid savings for managing pension fund deficits. I do not know whether or not that is so. For 
example, the build up of deposits has been concentrated in a few sectors: real estate, and business 
services, and it is not obvious that these sectors have big pension fund deficits (Chart 7).  
But that pensions have been a material component in firms’ cash management is not in doubt. That is 
apparent in the share of gross corporate savings accounted for by employers’ contributions to pension 
funds (Chart 8). Contributions have tripled – or in real terms doubled – since the late 1990s (Chart 9)2. 
Part  of  this  reflects  ‘special’  or  ‘one-off’  contributions  to  reduce  deficits.  But,  judging  by  self-
administered schemes3, regular contributions have doubled (Chart 10). What is going on here? 
Well,  it  might  have  something  to  do  with  your  management  of  risk,  bearing  in  mind  avoidable  and 
unavoidable sources of uncertainty. 
A  corporate  sponsor  of  a  defined-benefit  pension  scheme  is,  in  effect,  providing  a  guarantee  or, 
broadly, writing a very complex option4: one on which the present value of the payoffs is related to, 
amongst other things, the future growth in earnings of its workforce, their longevity, and the yield on an 
equivalent-maturity  risk-free  bond.  Apart  from  the  design  of  the  scheme  itself  and  the  associated 
balance of wages and pensions in employee remuneration, the sponsor makes two big choices: the 
level of contributions it makes to the fund, and the asset allocation of the fund. (It may seem odd to 
say that the sponsor makes a decision about fund asset allocation, because of course that is formally 
the responsibility of trustees. But as guarantors, those decisions affect the risk run by sponsors who, in 
principle,  could  make  adjustments  to  their  own  balance  sheet  if  they  regarded  trustee  choices  as 
suboptimal.) 
Past increases in life expectancy entail higher contributions and, other things being equal, add to the 
marginal cost of a firm’s labour force. An unavoidable source of uncertainty is future developments in 
longevity.  
                                                 
1  See footnote 18, Chapter IV ‘Awash with cash: why are corporate savings so high?’, World Economic Outlook, April 2006, 
page 151.  
2   For the household sector, the effect has been that employer contributions more than account for total net savings.  
3   A breakdown of contributions into ‘one-off’ and ‘regular’ is available only for self-administered schemes. They account for 
around half of total employers’ contributions to private pension schemes.  
It is option-like because of the asymmetry between extracting surpluses from pension funds and making good deficits.

In the asset allocation of a fund, company sponsors face, at one remove, a trade-off. On the one hand, 
if a fund holds risky assets, it will earn a risk premium but its value will tend to be more volatile, varying 
with the long-term risk-free rate used to discount its liabilities and the value of its risky assets. On the 
other  hand,  a  fund  could  choose  to  hold  only  risk-free  assets  matching  the  characteristics  of  the 
scheme’s liabilities; for example, buying annuities which can hedge the duration and longevity risk in 
known  pension  liabilities.  In  that  case,  the  fund’s  expected  returns  will  be  lower,  and  so  sponsor 
contributions will have to be higher in order for the fund to meet the scheme’s future obligations. 
In short, company sponsors face some sources of avoidable uncertainty about the future value of their 
pension funds, with the level of their contributions akin to a premium paid to reduce or remove that 
uncertainty. (The funds’ trustees face a subtly different risk trade off, in which they need to weigh the 
correlation of the risks in the asset-liability mix of their fund with the risks to the sponsor’s business 
and net worth, and so to its capability to meet any future fund shortfall.) 
How  much  risk  a  company  should  take  in  its  core  business  and  in  the  provision  of  pensions  is 
obviously  a  matter  for  its  board.  A  famous  paper  in  corporate  finance5  finds  that,  subject  to  some 
(admittedly fairly strong) assumptions about tax etc, the market value of a company (measured as the 
sum  of  the  value  of  all  its  financial  liabilities,  equity  and  debt)  should  not  depend  on  its  capital 
structure. Rather, its capital structure affects the risk to equity holders, and so the headline return they 
should  rationally  require  to  compensate  for  risk.  Within  this  framework,  defined-benefit  pension 
schemes  can  be  viewed  as  deferred  compensation  and  so  as  entailing  a  form  of  indebtedness  (in 
many  cases,  de  facto  indexed-linked  borrowing)  for  their  sponsors,  to  be  ‘serviced’  alongside  their 
more  conventional  external  indebtedness.  Perhaps  that  has  become  most  obvious  when  a  fund  is 
calculated as being in deficit.  
It  would  seem  that  in  recent  years  there  has  been  a  keener  awareness  of  this  way  of  thinking 
analytically about pension obligations. If there has been an ‘awakening’, maybe it was triggered by a 
combination of the volatility of the value of equities held by funds, especially when they fell sharply a 
few years ago; the volatility of the discounted value of their liabilities as long-maturity real rates fell; 
regulatory  requirements  governing  the  closure  of  deficits;  and  fluctuations  in  the  net  value  of  funds 
having for the first time to be reflected in firms’ capital in their financial accounts.  
Firms may, therefore, have been reviewing their preferences between risk-taking in their core business 
and risk-taking via pension provision, and for a while may have been unusually uncertain about how 
equity markets value those different sources of uncertainty. If so, that may conceivably offer part of the 
explanation for the measured recovery in UK business investment having been weak, relative to the 
economy’s total output, compared with past cycles (Charts 11 and 12). Some have suggested that the 
need to close deficits may have been a factor, via the call on cash flows. The possibility I am airing is 
that another factor may be the size of a scheme’s discounted liabilities and the prospective volatility of 
the associated fund’s net value relative to the sponsor’s underlying business and capitalisation.  
I do not want to push that too far. There have, of course, been other possible explanations for weak 
fixed-capital expenditure. These include competition from China, India and elsewhere; the rise in oil 
and commodity prices; and the uncertainty about how both will play out, and thus about prospective 
demand for UK output. All of this might have been thought to make the external environment unusually 
risky and so to warrant deferral of investment decisions.  
Another  possible  explanation  is,  simply,  that  the  level  of  investment  has  been  under-recorded,  and 
that the data will be revised up, as they have been frequently in the past (Chart 13). Indeed, as the 
share of economic activity accounted for business and financial services increases, it is even possible 
that  a  growing  part  of  business  investment  is  simply  unmeasured.  When  your  teams  spend  time 
developing spreadsheets that will be used for 3-5 years, do you count that as investment? 
So it is difficult to know whether or not the management of risks associated with pension provision has 
had a bearing on the recent measured weakness in business investment.

Financial market uncertainties 
It has, though, surely been an important factor in financial markets in recent years.  
The  most  obvious  manifestations  have  been  associated  with  their  own  jargon:  Liability-Driven 
Investment (or LDI), and so-called ‘alpha-generating’ active-management strategies.  
LDI  involves  matching  a  fund’s  assets  more  closely  with  its  quasi-fixed-income  liabilities,  via 
purchases of long-duration conventional bonds, inflation-indexed (or real) bonds, interest-rate swaps 
and  inflation  swaps.  This  may  well  have  amplified  the  fall  in  very  long-maturity  real  forward  rates, 
which has been such a puzzle in recent years (Chart 14).  
Greater asset-liability matching represents a reduction of risk, and so – at least at first blush – does 
not obviously square with a more aggressive approach to active management via increasingly popular 
‘alpha’ strategies. But quite what such strategies entail may need a bit of unpacking.  
Conventionally, in the framework of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, ‘alpha’ would refer to excess risk-
adjusted  return  (a  nice  thing  if  you  can  get  it!).  In  practice,  the  term  seems  to  be  deployed  rather 
loosely,  being  used  variously  to  cover  allocations  to  assets  whose  returns  have  in  the  past  been 
relatively uncorrelated with a fund’s liabilities; leveraged – that is to say, risk-enhancing – plays across 
almost  any  asset  class;  and  giving  greater  freedom  to  fund  managers.  For  pension  funds,  one 
motivation has probably been to diversify asset portfolios, perhaps evidenced by bigger allocations to 
private  equity,  commodities  etc.  Another  motivation,  both  here  and  overseas,  seems  to  be to  try  to 
close deficits partly by earning high investment returns on some proportion of their asset portfolios. 
Cast in that light, it appears to be part of the broader ‘search for yield’, which has been offered by 
some  as  contributing  over  the  past  couple  of  years  to  the  compression  in credit  spreads  and  other 
market-based indicators of risk, such as the price of options on most asset classes. 
Two  responses  to  this  have  circulated  amongst  market  participants,  both  intermediaries  and  asset 
managers. One is that falls in implied risk premia truly have reflected a reduction in risk. The other is 
that, while that story might hold up to a point, risk has been under-priced. 
It  is  certainly  plausible  that  structural  change  has  caused  risk  to  decline  somewhat  over  the  past 
decade  or  so.  First,  monetary  policy  regimes  have  become  more  credible.  That  being  so,  central 
banks  may  be  able  to  stabilize  demand  and  output  growth  more  effectively  than  in  the  past.  Most 
obviously,  cuts  in  interest  rates  are  now  much  more  likely  to  be  understood  as  a  response  to  an 
adverse demand shock rather than as attempts to generate extra demand and jobs in the short run at 
the cost of stoking up higher medium-term inflation. And so it is easier for central banks to cut interest 
rates when that would desirable in order to stabilise demand conditions and so keep inflation in line 
with  the  target.  Related  to  that,  greatly  increased  transparency  across  the  central  banking  world 
makes policy surprises – and so outsized market reactions to policy decisions – somewhat less likely. 
Second,  more  competitive  and  transparent  product  markets  (partly  thanks  to  the  internet),  together 
with  more  flexible  labour  markets,  may  have  improved  the  real  economy’s  ability  to  absorb  nasty 
shocks  without  persistent  large  falls  in  output.  Third,  developments  in  banking  probably  mean  that 
more households have access to credit to help them to smooth their consumption by borrowing during 
‘bad times’. And by routinely distributing more risk to non-banks, the banking system may be less likely 
to wish or need to conserve capital, refraining from taking risk, when faced with increased demand for 
liquidity from its corporate and household customers. For these reasons, consumption growth may be 
less prone to violent lurches than during, say, the 1970s and 1980s.  
In  parallel,  new  techniques  for  unbundling  and  distributing  risk,  and  possibly  also  asset  managers 
working under fewer constraints than in the past, may have made financial markets more efficient. For 
any given level of expected volatility in the economy, that may have enabled investors to hold more 
diversified  portfolios,  reducing  the  excess  returns  (or  risk  premia)  required  for  bearing  the  residual 
undiversified risk.  
Taken together, other things being equal, these factors would tend to work in the direction of reducing 
inflation risk premia and term premia in government bond yields, credit spreads, equity risk premia, 
and implied volatilities derived from options. 
But there are important qualifications to this story, especially regarding what it implies looking forward. 
First,  various  cyclical  developments,  such  as  corporate  sector  balance  sheet  repair,  have  probably 
reduced  risk.  And,  of  course,  growth  is  currently  robust  pretty  uniformly  across  the  world economy. 
Those  features  of  the  environment  may  have  reduced  risk  premia,  cyclically.  There  is  no  way  to 
separate out with any precision the cyclical and structural, potentially more persistent, influences on 
BIS Review 47/2006

the price of risk. Second, the importance of some of those structural factors may be exaggerated by 
market participants. Closest to home for me, I would not want anyone to think that central banks are 
capable  of  delivering  uninterrupted  growth  indefinitely.  And  while  central  banks  no  longer  seek  to 
spring surprises on the market, our community could not rule them out if circumstances were to evolve 
where the market misperceived the implications of a central bank’s analysis of the outlook. 
But perhaps the most important point for the pricing of risk in capital markets is the following. To the 
extent that a structural story of some kind holds true, the consequent reduction in risk premia, and the 
associated rise in asset prices, would broadly be a one-off – even if drawn out. In other words, it would 
not  be sensible  for  market  participants  both  to  place  weight  on  the  argument  that  risk  premia  were 
lower because there was fundamentally less risk, and at the same time to extrapolate ex post returns 
on assets into the future. Headline returns would be lower than in the hypothesised ‘old world’ when 
risk premia were higher; and would be a lot lower than during the period when risk premia were falling 
to a new, lower level (Diagram A). 
This  may  not  be  completely  idle  speculation  in  a  market  environment  where,  anecdotally,  fund 
managers have been chasing returns. And, of course, to the extent that past returns have in degree 
been extrapolated into the future, the effect might be an over compression of risk premia. 
That  has  to  be  for  you  and  other  market  participants  to  judge.  What,  from  the  sidelines,  we  have 
observed is striking innovation in ways of taking and distributing risk, against a background of strong 
asset-price  performance  in  recent  years  and a  presently  benign macroeconomic  environment.  Over 
the  past  few  years  and  currently,  this  has,  perhaps,  been  most  obvious,  and  most  topical,  in  the 
structured  finance  markets.  These  are  the  markets  in  which  portfolios  of  loans  to  households  and 
companies – or synthetic versions of such loans created via credit derivatives – are bundled up into, 
for example, collateralised loan obligations (CLOs) and collateralised debt obligations of asset-backed 
securities (CDOs of ABS). The slicing and dicing of credit portfolios into different risk tranches can give 
end-investors access to assets more finely tailored to their particular demands and risk appetites. In 
most circumstances, that should distribute risk more effectively, buttressing the stability of the market 
and of the financial system as a whole. Looking ahead, a few questions are nevertheless posed by 
market participants.  
One  is  whether  the  CDO  factory  has  amplified  the  compression  of  credit  spreads.  The  argument 
advanced  goes  roughly  as  follows:  that,  as  credit  spreads  have  fallen,  the  returns  have  become 
unattractive  unless  leveraged  up;  that  the  new  technology  for  acquiring  leverage6  has  drawn  new 
sources of capital – including hedge funds – in to the credit markets; and that this increase in demand 
has  fed  through  to  a  lower  price  for  credit  risk  –  ie  lower  spreads,  easier  convenants,  etc  –  in  the 
underlying  loan  markets,  including  for  financing  LBOs.  These  new  instruments  have  of  course 
emerged, and so have been priced, during a period when the default rate has been extraordinarily low. 
A  second  question  is  whether  the  trade  off  between  the  demand  for  financial  engineering  and  the 
demand  for  liquidity  in  the  structured  finance  markets,  not  just  amongst  leveraged  players,  could 
switch – back to liquidity – if market conditions were to shift from benign to stressed. An illustration of 
what can potentially happen is perhaps provided by the disruption just over a decade ago in the US 
Collateralised  Mortgage  Obligation  (CMO)  market.  After  a  period  of  ever  more  refined  financial 
engineering  of  mortgage  claims  into  capital  market  instruments,  resulting  in  some  fairly  illiquid 
tranches  being  created,  stress  occurred  when  the  dollar  yield  curve  rose  sharply  in  1994.  This 
underlines the importance of industry scenario analysis building in some allowance for the possibility 
of system-wide liquidity stresses.  
                                                 
6   Leverage,  in  this  sense,  can  be  understood  as the  sensitivity  of  the spread  over risk-free  rates  on  a  particular  credit 
instrument to a given change in credit spreads generally. In a CDO, the credit risk on an asset portfolio is split into tranches 
of varying seniority. The vast majority of expected losses from credit risk are concentrated in the most junior (or ‘equity’) 
tranche. In consequence, the prices of such junior tranches are highly sensitive (up to 20 times greater than the price of the 
entire portfolio) to changes in the general level of credit spreads, giving a highly leveraged exposure. In turn, CDO tranches 
may be repackaged into 'CDOs of CDOs' or leveraged in other ways. For example, a popular product has been so-called 
'leveraged super-senior' in which an investor sells credit protection on part of most senior tranche of a CDO but earns an 
additional  return  by  agreeing  to bear  losses  if,  say,  the  tranche’s  market  value  breaches  a  trigger  point.  For  further 
information see Belsham, T. N. Vause and S. Wells, ‘Credit correlation: interpretation and risks’, Bank of England Financial 
Stability  Review,  December  2005,  pages  103-115;  and  Rule,  D.,  ‘The  credit  derivatives  market:  its  development  and 
possible implications for financial stability’, Bank of England Financial Stability Review, June 2001, pages 117-140.

 BIS Review 47/2006
A counterpart to whether market volatility could occur is the question of whether risk could flow back to 
the banking sector in adverse circumstances. Over the past decade, many banks have moved towards 
business models based around originating and distributing credit assets rather than holding them. But 
no  one  suggests  that  banks  escape  the  risk  completely.  They  warehouse  risk  before  it  can  be 
securitized,  and  those  warehouses  will  probably  have  grown  with  the  volumes  flowing  through  the 
securitisation  markets.  To  a  greater  or  lesser  extent,  they  hold  on  to  loans  and  securitised 
participations if they think them attractive, or perhaps punitively expensive to distribute. Through their 
prime brokerage operations, they finance leveraged holdings against collateral. And they sometimes 
provide  committed  lines  of  credit.  Overall,  this  is  akin  to  writing  deeply  out-of-the-money  options, 
exposing  the  banking  system  to  tail  risk.  That  should  not  be  too  surprising  given  that  commercial 
banks’ liabilities are money, and so they are in the business of providing liquidity insurance. But it does 
make  it  difficult  for  market  participants  to  assess,  and  price  for,  how  much  risk  there  is,  albeit 
contingently, in the system as a whole.  
Conclusion 
Many  of  the  developments  I  have  reviewed  are,  of  course,  good  news.  Most  obviously,  longer  life 
expectancy! Greater macro economic stability; financial innovation distributing risk more efficiently – 
these  are  pretty  good  things  too,  including  for  you  as  corporate  treasurers.  As  a  result,  some  risks 
have been reduced or are now easier to manage.  
But  risk  management  challenges  do  unquestionably  remain  for  you  as  corporate  treasurers.  Some, 
such as those arising from pension provision, essentially boil down to your appetite for risk and the mix 
of business/financial risk you want. Others stem from a range of uncertainties in capital markets. When 
and  how  global  imbalances  will  be  resolved.  Whether  risk  is  underpriced.  How  still-new  structured 
finance markets would withstand a marked pick up in defaults. You will each have your own list.  
Those uncertainties and risks have to be identified, priced and managed. The official sector cannot 
make them go away. 
But it is our mission to reduce uncertainties stemming from monetary policy and its implementation. 
Some  important  sources  of  uncertainty  in  the  past  were,  in  fact,  avoidable.  For  some  years  now, 
monetary policy decision taking has benefited from having a clear framework and from the Bank being 
transparent about its analysis of the economic outlook. Yesterday, by modernising the sterling money 
markets,  the  Bank  provided  a  similarly  clear  framework  for  how  we  implement  those  interest  rate 
decisions. I hope it makes your jobs a little easier.
