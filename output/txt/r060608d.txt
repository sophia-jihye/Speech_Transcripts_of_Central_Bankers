Glenn Stevens: Risk and the macroeconomy 
Address  by  Mr  Glenn  Stevens,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Australia,  to  the  2006 
Securities & Derivatives Industry Association conference, Melbourne, 27 May 2006. 
 I am pleased to be here in Melbourne to take part in your conference.  
There seems no better issue to discuss with a group of securities and derivatives professionals than 
risk and its pricing. This is quite topical since, as you would be well aware, the extent of additional 
return paid to investors to take on risk seems to have been unusually low in recent years.  
There are several questions that naturally arise, and which I would like to address. 
First, how does the recent period compare historically? Compensation for risk is low compared with 
the 1980s and 1990s, but what can we learn from a longer-run comparison? 
Second, to what extent can it be claimed that the underlying economic outcomes, which presumably 
have a major bearing on investors’ perceptions of risk, are less “risky” or volatile than they used to be?  
Third,  what  are  the  odds  that  this  apparently  benign  environment  will  persist?  What  factors  might 
prompt a change?  
What is risk? 
To  begin,  it  is  perhaps  important  to  be  clear  what  we  mean  by  “risk”,  and  how  it  differs  from 
“uncertainty”, a distinction first made by Frank Knight1 in 1921.  
He wrote:  
“The  practical  difference  between  the  two  categories,  risk  and  uncertainty,  is  that  in  the 
former  the  distribution  of  the  outcome  in  a  group  of  instances  is  known  (either  through 
calculation a priori or from statistics of past experience), while in the case of uncertainty this 
is  not  true,  the  reason  being  in  general  that  it  is  impossible  to  form  a  group of  instances, 
because the situation dealt with is in a high degree unique.” 
Risk can be priced, on the assumption that the probabilities in the future will be those inferred from the 
past. In Peter Bernstein’s2 excellent book Against the Gods, the early development of thinking about 
risk is presented as arising from the study of games of pure chance – where the odds are precisely 
calculable. The classic response to the chance-like characteristics of life is insurance. Actuaries draw 
up tables of life expectancy for a population based on historical experience, and insurance companies, 
with  reasonable  confidence,  price  policies.  The  probability  and  likely  cost  of  certain  other  events – 
fires, car accidents, etc. – is sufficiently calculable that, over time, risk can be priced.  
In the case of uncertainty, we don’t or can’t know the parameters of the distribution. Events that have 
no  known  parallel  in  recent  history,  where  there  is  no  basis  for  determining  expected  frequency  or 
impact, will not easily be amenable to pricing. An avian flu pandemic, for example, could result in a 
frequency  and  severity  of  illnesses  and  a  number  of  deaths  that  is  outside  any  recent  historical 
experience, with important implications for life and health insurance providers.  
In fact, many economic and financial processes produce outcomes that do not come from any known 
statistical  distribution,  because  the  human  interactions  which  drive  them  are  not  like  the  turn  of  a 
roulette wheel or throw of a dice. In such a world, quantification and formal management of risk can go 
only so far; there will always be some possibilities that simply can’t be priced.  
These issues are quite important, and will intrude into our discussion later on. But for now, let me turn 
to what the quantitative evidence can offer us.

Risk Pricing 
The place to start is with the level of long-term rates on highly rated sovereign debt. Given that the 
likelihood of default by such countries is remote, what is being priced here, essentially, is the rate and 
variability of future inflation. For those of us whose economics awareness dates from some time in the 
1970s  or  later,  it  certainly  seems  that  long-term  interest  rates  globally  have  in  recent  years  been 
unusually low. In the United States, 10-year Treasury note yields were below 5 per cent over several 
years, which stands out compared with the history of the preceding few decades. Furthermore, it is 
historically  unusual  for  these  rates  to  have  been  low  and  pretty  steady  at  a  time  when  the  Fed  is 
raising short-term rates. That this would coincide with a sizeable US budget deficit, and a US current 
account deficit of unprecedented magnitude, was certainly not anticipated by any observer I can recall. 
It  was  labelled  a  “conundrum”3,  and  “an  intriguing  financial  phenomenon”4  by  successive  Fed 
chairmen. 
Long-term interest rates in other major centres – Japan and Europe – have been even lower than US 
rates. As recently as 2003, Japan’s rates were the lowest on record anywhere that we could find over 
several centuries. These yields too have risen somewhat from those levels, but remain very low by 
standards of the past couple of decades.  
Because sovereign yields in major countries have been low, so have those for most private borrowers 
and  many  emerging-market  sovereign  borrowers  in  capital  markets.  But  there  has  also  been 
considerable  compression  in  risk  spreads  for  both  corporate  and  emerging-market  sovereign  debt, 
which takes them back to levels that were observed in the mid 1990s. Many observers have a feeling 
of discomfort about all this – since, on some previous occasions, spreads this low quickly gave way to 
much higher pricing for risk in the face of some event, like the Asian crisis, the LTCM episode or the 
global downturn of 2000-01. All too often, risk has – in hindsight – been underestimated in good times 
and overestimated in bad times.

 Against the backdrop of the past century, on the other hand, recent levels of long-term US interest 
rates do not look especially low; they look quite within the range of historical experience, especially 
experience when inflation was low. The 1970s and 1980s look more like the outlying period. Nor have 
spreads, for US corporate debt at least, been all that low when viewed from this longer perspective. 
There were lengthy periods in the mid part of the 20th century when spreads were as low as or lower 
than they are today.

  It is more difficult to get consistent data for emerging market yields and spreads over history. But a 
study released a few years ago by the IMF suggested that, on average, emerging market spreads in 
the 1990s were much higher – twice as high or more – as in the period of globalisation and free capital 
flows leading up to World War I.5  
Now it could immediately be objected that the world of today is a vastly different place from that of 
these historical episodes, so that any comparison is not valid. During World War II and up to 1951, US 
bond rates were effectively pegged by the Fed under the monetary procedures then in place. Hence, 
the bond market was not really a market.6 The US corporate debt market was not so regulated but it 
was  a  vastly  reduced  market  in  size  in  this  period,  after  the  extremely  high  rates  of  default  in  the

period of the Great Depression.7 The peak number of US corporate borrowers rated by Moody’s in the 
mid 1920s was not surpassed until 1997.8 So while those bonds that were in the market from the end 
of World War II until the early 1970s paid quite low spreads, it is not clear to what extent this provides 
a reasonable basis for comparison with the larger and more active market of today.  
On the other hand, it is a natural human tendency to think that the world we face is unprecedented in 
its risk and complexity compared with the past, when it probably is not.9 It has to be said as well that 
the 1970s and 1980s were also, historically, rather an unusual period. This era saw a major outbreak 
of price inflation, which had hitherto been seen only during wars. Inflation was not only high, but highly 
variable,  and  policy-makers  struggled  to  formulate  an  effective  response.  This  was  extremely 
disruptive for fixed-income markets, and for financial asset pricing generally. Nominal yields rose to 
unheard of levels.10 The business cycle downturns of this period seemed to be much more damaging 
than earlier post-World War II recessions. In general, it was a period of considerable macroeconomic 
instability.  
That instability has subsided considerably since then, as I shall show in a moment. But the echoes of 
the 1970s and 1980s – an intellectually formative period for most of us here – took a long time to fade; 
just as nominal interest rates took time to recognise rising inflation, they took time to recognise what 
was clearly, in hindsight, a fundamental regime shift in inflation which occurred in most countries in the 
mid 1980s.  
So in assessing the level of interest rates or spreads for reasonableness, it can be difficult to find a 
period of history that can serve as a neutral basis for comparison. While the mid 20th century might not 
be  ideal  as  a  benchmark,  the  1970s  and  1980s  are  surely  quite  unsatisfactory.  Perhaps  the  safest 
conclusion is that no historical period can be assumed unambiguously to be a good benchmark for 
pricing.  Each  period  is  different  and  we  need  to  make  efforts  to  understand  the  forces  at  work  in 
economies and financial markets at the time.  
Economic variability 
That brings me to the second set of questions: is there any evidence, at a macroeconomic level, that 
economies are less volatile than they were in the past?  
The  answer  is  clearly  yes.  A  host  of  studies  have  documented  a  decline  in  the  variability  of  GDP 
growth not only in the United States but also in a number of developed economies, even though there 
are still periodic recessions.11  
                                                      
7   One  authoritative  study  found  that  one-tenth  of  investment  grade  and  over  one-third  of  speculative  grade  corporate 
borrowers defaulted between the end of 1931 and the end of 1935.   See W. Braddock Hickman (1958), Corporate Bond 
Quality and Investor Experience, Princeton University Press for National Bureau of Economic Research.

Is the world a more risky place today than it was 50 or 60 years ago?   I am not sure that it is.   We can point to the threat of 
terrorism, the impact of globalisation on various business models, avian flu and so on.   But without wishing to downplay the 
importance of those factors, the earlier era included World War II, the Korean and Vietnam wars, the broader cold war with 
its  threat  of  nuclear  conflict,  and  intense  political  uncertainty  and  risk  in  various  countries.      In  late-1940s  Australia,  for 
example, the Federal Government sought to nationalise the banking system – presumably a source of considerable risk for 
the  owners  of  the  time.      There  were  also  major  technology  changes  in  that  era,  which  would  have  destabilised  some 
important existing business models.   For example, the development of air transport, and its acceleration (literally) with the 
development of the jet aircraft in the 1950s, would have changed the outlook for railroads and ocean travel dramatically.   
The advent of transistors was, by the 1960s, transforming the electronics sector long before the PC or the flat-panel screen 
arrived.   Arguably the world was no less “risky”, or more precisely, a no less uncertain place in those days.    
10  Bernstein writes (op cit, pp. 334-335):  “In the early 1970s, long-term interest rates rose above 5 per cent for the first time 
since the Civil War and have dared to remain above 5 per cent ever since”.  This was written in 1996.  Long-term US rates 
have,  of  course,  subsequently  traded  as  “low”  as  below  4 per  cent  and  are  currently  about  5 per  cent.      This  territory 
presumably looks much more familiar to people who remember the 1950s and 1960s.

   Much  of  this  literature  has  tended  to  compare  the  period  since  the  mid  1980s  with  the  preceding 
couple of decades. But in fact, for the US at least, a decline had been under way long before then. 
Work conducted by one of my RBA colleagues, John Simon,12 documents a long-term trend decline in 
US output volatility dating from the early 1950s, which was interrupted by the 1970s’ and early 1980s’ 
instability.

An even more remarkable feature of the past 15 years is the trend decline in both the rate of inflation 
and the variability of inflation. The average rate of inflation since the mid 1990s in the US has been 
about one-third of what it was in the period 1970-85, while the volatility of inflation has fallen to about 
one-seventh  of  its  previous  value.  Quite  similar  results  have  been  observed  in  Australia.  For  the 
OECD group, the trend is similar though less pronounced.  
These  trends  are  surely  of  great  importance  for  financial  pricing.  There  will  always  be  individual 
businesses  that  fail  because  of  technological  obsolescence,  flawed  strategies  and  so  on – 
idiosyncratic risk remains. That is why the list of firms in the Dow Jones 30 or the ASX top 50 is rather 
different  today  from  a  decade  or  two  ago.13  But  insofar  as  the  probability  of  default  usually  rises 
sharply  in  a  business  cycle  downturn,  it  must  matter  that  the  size  of  year-to-year  fluctuations  in 
economic activity is half what it once was. And the value of re-attaining virtual price stability around the 
world, dramatically reducing one source of uncertainty over the future value of nominal claims, should 
not be underestimated. High and variable inflation is a powerful deterrent to people parting with their 
money  for  long  periods.  To  the  extent  that  the  term  premium  in  long-term  interest  rates  reflects 
compensation for both the level and the volatility of expected future inflation, one could expect those 
premia to be reduced if we have returned to a world of near price stability. An alternative way to make

the same point is to note that a more stable world means less variation in policy interest rates, which 
presumably reduces premia built into longer-term rates to compensate for expected future variability in 
short rates.  
That having been said, the evidence for this greater macroeconomic stability producing less volatile 
returns to equity or bond investors to date is mixed. Volatility in returns to equity holders, measured by 
rolling standard deviations of quarterly accumulation index returns, displays pronounced cycles. But 
there is little obvious tendency for equity returns volatility in the US or Australia to be systematically 
lower since the early 1990s (though for Australia it was lower than the peak levels of the mid 1970s). 
Volatility in bond returns tended to remain reasonably high in the US in this period, notwithstanding the 
improvement in inflation stability.14 If this indicates continuing volatility in subjective discount rates, it 
may  have  limited  the  extent  to  which  volatility  of  equity  returns  could  fall.15  Were  macroeconomic 
stability to continue, it is conceivable that long-term interest rates might also become more stable; that 
would presumably carry some implications for equity (and other asset) valuations. But whether that 
occurs or not remains to be seen. Indeed at present we seem, if anything, to be seeing something of a 
pick-up in short-term volatility in many asset classes.

14  The  data  suggest  that  volatility  of  returns  to  holders  of  US Treasuries  soared  during  the  economic  instability  of  the  late 
1970s and early 1980s, as the US fought and ultimately broke a serious inflation.   In Australia’s case, an apparent rise in 
volatility in the 1980s mainly reflected the bond market becoming a real market again, rather than a captive arrangement for 
investors.   Volatility of returns these days is comparable to the US results.

returns  is  related  not  just  to  the  volatilities  of  the  flow  of  earnings  and  discount  rates,  but  also  the  co-variance  between 
earnings and discount rates.

 The evidence for enhanced stability for emerging markets is not so easy to come by. But it could be 
said, I think, that the fundamental position of a number of emerging-market countries has improved 
since  the  late  1990s.  They  have  increased  growth  and  greatly  reduced  inflation.  The  median  credit 
rating  of  the  countries  in  the  JPMorgan  EMBI  has  risen  by  two  notches.  Recent  work  by  the  IMF 
suggests  that  such  factors  can  account  for  part,  though  not  all,  of  the  decline  in  spreads  in  recent 
years.16 Of course, the fact that this has been a period of quite stable economic outcomes and low 
yields  in  developed  countries,  hence  prompting  a  search  for  yield  elsewhere,  has  been  a  big 
advantage  to  emerging-market  borrowers.  But  a  number  of  these  countries  do  seem  to  have  been 
using  the  benign conditions  to strengthen  their  financial  resilience.  One  of  the  periodic  tests  of  that 
resilience appears to be under way at present.

This  very  brief  look  at  some  of  the  key  facts  cannot  claim  to  be  a  comprehensive  analysis. 
Nonetheless, a marked improvement in macroeconomic conditions in many countries – not just lower 
volatility of growth, but also a vast reduction in inflation and inflation variability – after the upheavals of 
the 1970s and early 1980s would seem to have been an important factor conditioning financial pricing 
for “risk” over recent years. That this might show up in yields and spreads, which look a bit more like 
they  were  in  the  1950s  and  1960s,  and  less  like  they  were  in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  is  not  that 
surprising. We cannot be sure, of course, whether the extent of the change has been appropriate, but 
we can at least see some logic for its direction. 
Can it last? 
The final question, then, is whether this apparently benign state of affairs can persist.

In  particular, given  that  long-term  yields  and spreads  have  recently  been  at  levels  seen  for  lengthy 
periods after World War II through until the 1960s, is it possible that the prospective environment for 
capitalist economies is actually like it was during that period? The post-war era was a period when 
there were still business cycles, but there was a long-asting and pretty robust secular expansion in 
economic activity and global trade, with relatively little instability. Granted, in Europe and Japan there 
was the rebuilding and “catch-up” after wartime devastation, which no longer needs to occur. But in its 
place  is  catch-up  by  China,  India  and  a  range  of  smaller  economies  which  are  engaging  in  the 
international economic and financial system. The openness of that system, if we are able to maintain 
it, arguably offers as much scope for strong growth accompanied by price stability as did the post-war 
world.  
Or is it the case that people are underestimating the likelihood of less stable times in the future? Is 
there,  just  around  the  corner,  some  event  that  will  usher  in  a  period  of  instability,  triggering  a 
wholesale  reappraisal  of  economic  and  financial  prospects,  and  hence  appetite  for  risk?  In  that 
scenario,  some  of  the  financial  exposures  that  were  taken  on  in  a  mood  of  optimism  over  the  past 
several years could be unwound, possibly quite disruptively.  
One’s answer to such questions hinges to a considerable extent on what one thinks was behind the 
enhanced  stability  of 
the  past  decade  and  a  half.  Better  macroeconomic  policies,  better 
microeconomic policies, globalisation, technological advance, good luck – all of these can plausibly be 
argued to have played a role. People can make their own assessments of the likelihood of a continued 
role for such factors (presumably one should not rely much on luck!).17  
The truth, however, is that our capacity to predict even the near-term future is limited. Grappling with 
the  question  of  whether  we  are  in  a  new  epoch –  and  pricing  accordingly –  is  an  even  bigger  ask. 
Following  World  War II,  the  main  fear  among  the  economics  fraternity  in  many  countries  was  of 
another depression and deflation akin to the 1930s, as the demand provided by defence expenditures 
tailed off and military personnel re-entered the civilian labour force.18 In fact, partly as a result of that 
policy  preoccupation,  the  economy  expanded  strongly  through  the  1950s  and  1960s,  and  it  was 
inflation, not deflation, that ultimately turned out to be the problem – a problem which then took quite 
some time (in Australia’s case, two decades) to sort out.  
That  should,  if  nothing  else,  make  us  cautious  about  long-term  prediction.  But  the  end  of  the  long 
post-war boom also highlights something else. We can see now that during that period, businesses, 
wage earners, industrial tribunals and policy-makers gradually adapted their behaviour as they came 
to assume that the long expansion could continue indefinitely. As they did, they sowed the very seeds 
of the expansion’s demise. The oil price rises of the mid 1970s were a shock, but the other problems 
on the supply side of market economies had been developing for some time.  
And that, perhaps, points to the relevant question to pose at present. It is possible that the world is in 
for another period of stability like the 1950s and 1960s. But even if it is, even if some of the “risks” of 
economic life, insofar as we can quantify them, are actually lower, or can be better managed, people 
will  adjust  to  that.  So  the  question  is:  might  not  the  behaviour  of  borrowers,  lenders,  investors  and 
price setters, in response to perceived lower risk, itself work to increase the probability of instability in 
future?  
This, of course, is the question posed about the tendency of households in some countries (including 
Australia) to take on much more debt. In enjoying – rationally, based on lengthening experience – the 
opportunities afforded by a more stable macroeconomic environment and a more complete and liquid 
set  of  capital  markets,  are  they  in  the  process  gradually  impairing  the  very  resilience  to  economic 
shocks which helped to produce the stability in the first place? It is not saying anything new to note 
that this is a significant source of uncertainty for policy-makers: there is no historical dataset to draw 
on  in  estimating  how  households  might  respond  to  a  macroeconomic  downturn  under  conditions  of 
                                                      
17   As  others  have  pointed  out,  though,  improvements  in  these  various  areas  do  not  make  for  continuing  reductions  in  risk 
premia and rises in asset valuations – only a one-time adjustment.   It is important that people understand that point, rather 
than  just  extrapolating  trends.      See  Paul  Tucker  (2006),  ‘Uncertainty,  the  Implementation  of  Monetary  Policy  and  the 
Management 
Risk’

much higher leverage. Nor, for lenders, could historical rates of default on mortgages be assumed to 
be a good guide to the future, since that dataset is derived from an era of different behaviour. It cannot 
be assumed that future outcomes will be drawn from the same distribution.  
Questions could well extend – once again – to some corporate entities before much longer, given the 
re-emergence  of  leveraged  buy-outs,  which  leave  the  cash-flow  positions  of  the  corporations  more 
precariously balanced. At least here there is, admittedly, more historical experience as a guide to likely 
subsequent behaviour.  
Of  perhaps  more  immediate  relevance,  considerable  sums  of  money  have  been  risked  over  recent 
years in various manifestations of the search for yield, which depended on a degree of stability and 
predictability  in  global  short-term  interest  rates  that  was  unlikely –  even  with  a  more  stable 
macroeconomy – to last for a long time. While I believe central banks will continue to control inflation 
over the years ahead, this does require short-term rates to move: they cannot stay low and steady 
permanently. Market action around the world over recent weeks reflects, in part, some adjustment to 
previous  assumptions  about  the  likely  degree  of  short-term  rate  variation  in  major  countries  which 
were overly sanguine.  
There  are  also  some  challenging  questions  associated  with  the  very  rapid  growth  seen  in  credit 
derivative  markets  in  recent  years.  Generally  speaking,  this  should  be  promoting  the  more  efficient 
pricing of credit risk and helping to shift it away from its intrinsic origin in businesses and their bankers 
to a broader set of holders who really want it. From the perspective of economic and financial stability, 
such a trend is to be welcomed. But even leaving aside the question of whether some investors know 
what they are actually getting into, the amount of leverage that can be embedded in such products is a 
potential source of trouble. There is also considerable uncertainty about whether, under conditions of 
stress, liquidity in these markets will be such as to allow risk-holders to manage their positions.  
I have made it almost to the end of my presentation without mentioning “global imbalances”. It is time 
they received a mention, though not in the way you probably would expect. While there are some risks 
posed  by  the  possibility  of  disorderly  changes  to  interest  rates,  exchange  rates,  American 
consumption patterns and so on, I think the biggest risk stemming from the imbalances is of another 
kind. It is that the wrong conclusions will be drawn, based on partial or simply wrong analysis, with the 
result that structural problems in various countries will not be addressed, and/or that protectionism will 
flourish, under the guise of attempts to affect bilateral “imbalances”. That would undermine the global 
openness that has helped to produce the enhanced stability we have been enjoying.  
Conclusion 
It is frustrating that we cannot offer a definitive assessment of the adequacy or otherwise of pricing for 
risk. Taking a long historical perspective, it is not unreasonable to claim that risk – at least aggregate 
economic variability – really is lower, in some important dimensions, than it was 10 or 20 years ago. 
Certainly the 1970s and early 1980s – a period which deeply affected financial markets for a very long 
time – were themselves unusual and not a good benchmark for judging pricing. Yet notwithstanding 
this evidence, experienced hands almost invariably have an uneasy feeling about developments. In 
part,  that  unease  reflects  a  conviction  that  the  business  cycle  (and  the  cycle  of  greed  and  fear  in 
markets) has not gone away. But it also reflects a recognition that behavioural changes are occurring, 
in response to the environment we face, which could elevate risks or create new ones. At some point, 
the financial structure emerging as a result of this behaviour will be tested. But exactly when the bell 
might ring to signify a new phase of the game, and what event might be the catalyst, we cannot say. In 
other words, life remains uncertain.  
That  is  a  good  reason  why,  as  my  US colleague,  Tim Geithner,19  suggested  recently,  thoughtful 
managers will surely be using the good times to strengthen resilience, and will be wary of the “late 
cycle” tendency for risk management and credit standards to become lax. Even if the future is pretty 
stable, there will still be a business cycle. Some occasional counter-cyclical behaviour gives us the 
best chance of continuing the stable, steady conditions – and good returns for investors – that markets 
seem so confidently to expect.
