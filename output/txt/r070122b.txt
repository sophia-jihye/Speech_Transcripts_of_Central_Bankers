Ajith Nivard Cabraal: Road map for monetary and financial sector policies in 
2007 and beyond 
Speech by Mr Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at the Central Bank 
International Conference hall, Colombo, 2 January 2007. 
 Introduction 
1. 
Your Excellencies, Members of the Monetary Board, Deputy Governors, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
At the outset, I wish to extend a warm welcome to all of you and wish you a very happy new year. As 
we mark the new year 2007, we thought it would be appropriate and timely for the Central Bank to 
enunciate its policies as well as the rationale therefor, so as to enhance policy predictability and 
transparency. We shall also take this opportunity to indicate our policy targets and share our latest 
available  information  in  relation  to  the  economy,  upon  which  our  analysis  and  targets  have  been 
based. 
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka was established in August 1950 under the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 
1949,  and  the  Act  sets  out  two  inter-dependent  core  objectives.  These  are  the  attainment  of  the 
economic and price stability and the maintenance of the financial system stability. 
Today, the Central Bank follows a monetary targeting policy framework in conducting monetary policy 
to  attain Economic and Price Stability,  i.e.,  to  achieve  a  sustainable,  low and predictable  level  of 
inflation. Such an outcome, among others, is a prerequisite to achieving sustainable economic growth 
and development. The key policy instrument used in this endeavour is the establishment of policy 
interest  rates  for  borrowing  (Repurchase  Rate)  and  for  lending  (Reverse  Repurchase  Rate)  that 
operates  through  the  Bank’s  Open  Market  Operations.  The  Central  Bank  conducts  Open  Market 
Operations to keep the level of Reserve money in the system at an appropriate level, while it uses the 
Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) on commercial bank deposit liabilities to further support the monetary 
policy. 
Financial  System  Stability,  the  other  core  objective  of  the  Central  Bank,  is  achieved  through  the 
regulation and supervision of financial institutions, the overseeing of the financial infrastructure which 
includes critical payment and settlement systems, as well as keeping a close watch on the financial 
markets as a whole. To achieve this objective, the Central Bank employs a series of prudential and 
regulatory measures. 
In addition to the core objectives, the Central Bank provides policy advice to the Government and 
vital state sector enterprises to strengthen macroeconomic stability and to enhance growth prospects. 
The  Bank  also  undertakes  several  agency  and  ancillary  functions,  which  include  managing  the 
Foreign  Reserves  of  the  country,  Public  Debt  and  Employees’  Provident  Fund  (EPF).  Further,  the 
Central Bank plays a key role in broadening the financial infrastructure and strengthening the small, 
medium and microfinance sectors in the country. 
Outline of today's statement 
2.  
The policy statement presented today for the year 2007 and beyond focuses on several areas. 
First, it sets out an account of the developments in the economy and the conduct of monetary policy 
and  financial  sector  policies  in  the  year  2006.  It  also  presents  an  evaluation  of  the  key  sectoral 
developments in 2006, the policy measures taken and the expected impact of such measures on the 
country’s macro-economic environment. 
Second, it examines the challenges in meeting monetary policy objectives and financial stability 
in 2007 and beyond. 
Third, the statement provides a detailed account of the Central Bank’s monetary policy strategy in 
2007 and beyond, as a major mechanism to drive the economy along a low – inflationary/high - growth 
path, supported by a series of other policies and strategies. 
Fourth, it discloses the policies for financial system stability in 2007 and beyond.

Fifth, it presents the identified policies for strengthening the economy, through the encouragement 
of high savings and investment. 
While we hope you would find our statement of interest, we wish to mention that, in the light of any 
unexpected  external  and  internal  developments,  we  may  sometimes  deviate  from  the  strategies  or 
targets as explained today. In such an event, we would, at that time, communicate our reasoning for 
such deviations for your understanding as well. 
Developments in the economy 
3.  
As is already known, the Sri Lankan economy achieved a growth of 8 per cent in the first half of 2006, 
and a growth of 7.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2006, Overall, it is very likely that the economy 
would have grown at over 7 per cent in 2006. 
These values are laudable because they have been achieved in the face of several major challenges, 
particularly  high  international  oil  prices  and  an  escalation  of  security  concerns  during  the  year. 
Notwithstanding such challenges, all major sectors of the economy grew at healthy rates. 
The  Agriculture  sector  continued  its  expansion  with  growth  recorded  in  all  sub  sectors,  except  tea. 
Remarkable  growth  in  rubber  and  coconut,  fast  recovery  in  the  fish  production,  record  harvests  of 
paddy in the Maha season 2005/2006, supported the growth in the agricultural sector. 
The Industry sector continued to grow, benefiting from the rapid global economic growth and strong 
domestic demand. Weather, favourable to hydropower generation, also contributed to the substantial 
growth in this sector. 
The  Services  sector  growth  was  dominated  by  the  telecommunication  services,  port  services, 
domestic and international trade, and financial services.

GDP Growth
 At  the  same  time  however,  inflation  began  to  increase  since  April  2006  due  to  rising  demand 
pressures in the economy. The point-to-point change in the Colombo Consumers’ Price Index (CCPI) 
which  is  popularly  considered  as  “inflation”,  has  been  increasing  since  April  2006  and  the  CCPI 
increased by around 19 per cent during each of the last two months. Although it was noted that a part 
of the increase was due to very high prices in vegetables, affected by extreme weather conditions, we 
noted with concern that core inflation too, which is a measure of inflation directly caused by demand 
pressures,  had  also  risen  to  15  per  cent  by  November  2006.  These  pressures  were  somewhat 
aggravated  by  supply  side  developments,  such  as  the  upward  adjustments  in  administered  prices, 
increases  in  prices  of  some  of  the  imported  consumer  items,  and  adjustments  in  import  tariffs 
applicable to some consumer food items. Such factors, of course, would essentially cause a one-time 
price  increase  and  would  necessarily  contribute  to  long  term  inflation  only  if  such  impact  is 
accommodated by continuing monetary expansion. 
In the meantime, we observed with satisfaction that increased economic activities had led to lower 
unemployment during the year. The Labour force grew by approximately 1.0 per cent to 8.1 million by 
end 2005, and was expected to increase further to 8.2 million by end 2006. As a consequence, the 
2 
 BIS Review 8/2007
unemployment rate declined to a level of 7.2 per cent in the first quarter 2006 and to its lowest level of 
6.3 per cent in the second quarter 2006. 
Savings and investment, both recorded upward trends. Domestic private savings in 2006 has now 
been projected to increase to 19.4 as a percentage of GDP. National savings are also projected to 
increase,  resulting  from  increased  savings  by  non-resident  Sri  Lankans  as  evidenced  by  the  high 
growth in migrant worker remittances. The Investment to GDP ratio is also expected to improve from 
26.5 per cent in 2005 to 29.0 per cent in 2006, and Private sector investment, which accounts for 
about 87 per cent of total investment, is estimated to increase by 31.4 per cent. Public sector 
investment  too  is  projected  to  rise  by  7.5  per  cent  as  a  result  of  growing  construction  activity  in 
highways,  roads,  infrastructure  facilities,  community  development  projects,  and  tsunami  related 
reconstruction and rehabilitation projects. 
The performance in the External sector improved with the continued expansion in international trade 
and growing global demand. During the first ten months of 2006, exports grew by 6.5 per cent and 
Imports by 15.8 per cent with a higher growth in intermediate and investment goods. The outlay for 
petroleum imports increased by 29.6 per cent during this period due to the soaring oil prices. For the 
year as a whole, export growth is projected at 7 per cent and import growth at 15.4 per cent. 
An aspect of the economy which caused some concern in the year was that the trade deficit widened 
to US dollars 2,955 million. As the result, the Current Account also recorded a deficit of US dollars 
1,038 million in the first nine months of 2006. It reflects the imbalance between national savings and 
investment, which needs to be addressed by encouraging greater savings. Such Trade and Current 
Account deficits were financed through net inflows to the capital and financial accounts. It was also 
observed  that  Sri  Lanka  could  reasonably  and  comfortably  afford  a  bulk  of  the  additional  foreign 
exchange cost on account of high oil prices in the first nine months of 2006 as a result of the higher 
migrant worker remittances and foreign currency denominated loans obtained by the government from 
external and domestic sources. Worker remittances increased by US dollars 338 million in the first 
ten  months  and  foreign  currency  denominated  debt  rose  by  US  dollars  404  million  by  end 
November  2006.  The  higher  quantum  of  worker  remittances  was,  to  some  extent,  facilitated  by  the 
active promotion campaigns launched by the Central Bank with the support of the Sri Lanka Foreign 
Employment Bureau, overseas job agencies, foreign missions and the state banks and we believe that 
the impact of such initiatives would be further felt in the next few years as well. 
During  this  year,  a  remarkable  increase  was  also  seen  in  foreign  direct  investments.  All  in  all, 
these  factors  contributed  towards  the  overall  balance  of  payments  (BOP)  surplus  which  is 
estimated to exceed US dollars 150 million during 2006.

 It is useful to recollect that since moving to the “Floating exchange rate” regime in 2001, the gross 
official  reserves  have  continued  to  increase  except  in  2004  when  the  country  was  hit  by  the 
sudden increase in oil prices. As of now, the gross official reserves have been sufficient to meet about 
3 months of average imports in the recent years despite the rising expenditure on oil imports. 
We  also  note  that  according  to  the  overall  policy  vision  announced  in  the  “Mahinda  Chintana”,  the 
Government’s commitment to reduce the budget deficit to a sustainable level in the medium term has 
been made clear. In that context, the fact that the total revenue during the first nine months of 2006 
increased, and thereby led to an improved Revenue/GDP ratio is laudable. In addition, it was noted 
BIS Review8/2007 
 3
that  several  measures  were  introduced  by  the  Government  to  rationalise  recurrent  expenditure, 
especially adjusting domestic fuel prices to reduce the burden on the Government. Nevertheless, the 
Government has had to resort to borrowings from the banking sector to meet shortfalls in the face of 
many challenges, and in order to avoid such a situation in the future, it would be highly desirable to 
further improve the Revenue generation and collection process in 2007 and beyond. 
Another key fiscal indicator, namely recurrent expenditure as a ratio of GDP recorded a value of 14.0 
per cent during this period. Capital expenditure and net lending also increased by 28.2 per cent during 
this period. The main contributors to this increase were the acceleration of infrastructure development 
and tsunami related reconstruction activities. All in all, the overall budget deficit in the first nine months 
of 2006 reached 6.0 per cent of GDP, while the budget deficit in 2006 is estimated to be 8.7 per cent 
of GDP. 
In  relation  to  the  outstanding  debt  stock  of  Government,  we  note  with  satisfaction  that  it  is 
expected to decline to 93.1 per cent of GDP by end 2006 from 93.9 per cent as at end 2005. The 
outstanding government debt to GDP ratio is also expected to decline in the medium term in line with 
the path enunciated in Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act. 
We could also report that the tight monetary policy stance adopted from end 2004 was further firmed 
in  2006  to  curtail  high  growth  in  monetary  and  credit  aggregates  to  contain  rising  inflationary 
pressures. Accordingly, the Central Bank raised its policy interest rates by 25 basis points in June 
2006,  12.5  basis  points  in  July  2006,  50  basis  points  in  September  2006,  and  a  further  37.5  basis 
points in December 2006: a total of 125 basis points during the year. This is in addition to the increase 
of policy rates by 175 basis points during 2004 and 2005. At the same time, the Central Bank has also 
been conducting Open Market Operations aggressively, to manage the liquidity position in the market 
to be within the reserve money targets.

 Responding  to  the  tight  monetary  policy  measures  adopted  thus  far,  market  interest  rates  have 
increased, thereby discouraging excessive consumption and borrowing for such purposes. In turn, this 
has led to a deceleration in the high growth in the money supply. We believe that the tight monetary 
policy exercised by the Central Bank was instrumental in pulling back the growth in Reserve money 
from 20 per cent at end 2004 to 17 per cent by end August 2006. This decrease would have naturally 
led to a corresponding deceleration in broad money growth in the future, although in absolute terms, 
the growth in broad money remained uncomfortably high, around 19-20 per cent, during January to 
June 2006, a legacy of the high reserve money growth in the past. 
In  keeping  with  its  primary  objective,  the  Central  Bank  has  also  been  very  concerned  about  the 
inflationary  impact  of  the  regular  use  of  Central  Bank’s  Reverse  Repo  window  by  some 
commercial banks which appear to use such window as a convenient instrument of regular funding. 
We wish to clearly discourage this practice in 2007 and therefore, with effect from 1st January 2007, 
the  Reverse  Repo  facility  of  the  Central  Bank  will  not  be  made  available  on  days  when  there  is  a 
liquidity surplus in the commercial banking system, according to our estimates. We would also closely 
monitor the Banks that seek this facility regularly to ascertain whether they are doing so because of 
any structural deficiencies that they are suffering from.

We also noted that the financial sector grew with increased resilience, possibly benefiting from robust 
economic growth and a rather favourable external environment. Profitability, capital funds and asset 
quality  of  banks  improved,  leading  to  strengthening  of  capacity  of  the  financial  sector  to  absorb 
shocks.  In  the  meantime,  interest  rates  across  markets  rose  in  response  to  gradual  tightening  of 
monetary policy; turnover in the foreign exchange market recorded substantial increases; and market 
capitalisation and price indices in the equity market continued to improve.

  It would also be noted in the year 2006, several  important measures were taken to strengthen and 
improve the efficiency of the financial sector, improve risk management, enhance access to finance, 
strengthen  the  payment  and  settlement  system  as  well  as  supervision  and  regulation.  Banks  were 
required  to  include  market  risk  in  the  computation  of  capital  adequacy  to  ensure  that  they  are 
adequately capitalised to meet any adverse fluctuations in market prices and are not vulnerable to any 
unanticipated shocks. Prudential norms for classification and valuation of bank investment portfolios 
were  further  strengthened.  To  improve  the  safety  and  efficiency  in  the  payments  and  settlements 
systems,  the  Central  Bank  also  drafted  a  payment  system  policy  in  consultation  with  the  National 
Payment Council to declare a public policy regarding the regulatory framework. 
As is well known, the Central Bank manages the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF). It does so by 
receiving member contributions, maintaining member accounts, investing funds and paying benefits to 
members.  The  total  assets  of  the  EPF  grew  by  13 per cent  to Rs.439 billion during  the  12  months 
ending June 2006. Total contributions and refunds during this period amounted to Rs.16 billion and 
Rs.13 billion, respectively. The total investment portfolio consisted mainly of government securities at 
98 per cent, while the total income for the first half of 2006 amounted to Rs.25 billion. 
The Central Bank also manages the Public Debt to ensure that the Government's financing needs and 
its payment obligations are met at the lowest possible cost over the medium to long term, consistent 
BIS Review8/2007

with a prudent degree of risk. During 2006, the Central Bank took several measures to strengthen the 
management of public debt by: 
• 
Increasing  the  capital  requirements,  introducing  a  risk  based  supervision  system  and 
supervision activities to strengthen the Primary Dealer System and financial sector stability 
Introducing  on-line  data  reporting  to  enhance  the  transparency  in  trading  government 
securities 
Facilitating capacity building of market players 
Permitting subscription upto 5 per cent of Treasury bonds by foreign investors 
Assisting  the  government  to  raise  foreign  currency  commercial  debt  through  syndicated 
loans from the international market 
Developing a comprehensive debt consolidation strategy 
Introducing  a  new  debt  instrument  named  Sri  Lanka  Nation  Building  Bonds  for  the  Sri 
Lankan working community living abroad thereby offering them an opportunity to contribute 
funds towards infrastructure development in the country. 
   In 2006, in order to create a more conducive external sector environment for both local and foreign 
investors, the Exchange Control Department also initiated the following several measures: 
• 
• 
Facilitating non-resident investments in government securities 
Introducing  two  new  foreign  currency  accounts  to  expand  incentives  available  for 
professionals who earn foreign exchange and for the suppliers of inputs to BOI companies 
who help to save foreign exchange. 
Authorized  dealers  have  been  permitted  to  open  and  operate  Treasury  Bond  Investment 
External Rupee Accounts (TIERA) in commercial banks in Sri Lanka, in order to facilitate the 
fund transfers in purchasing treasury bonds by non-residents. 
Challenges in meeting price and economic stability and financial system stability in 
2007 and beyond  
Sri Lanka, being a small open economy, continues to face external shocks arising from global political 
and economic developments, domestic disturbances and natural disasters. At the same time, while the 
emergence of South Asia as a new force in the world economy would provide new opportunities for Sri 
Lanka  to  achieve  higher  economic  growth,  the  geopolitical  uncertainties  that  would  impact  global 
economic  stability  would  probably  pose  a  threat  to  meeting  external  sector  targets  in  2007  and 
beyond, and therefore would need close monitoring. 
Two of the more significant challenges that would have to be faced in 2007 would be the impact of 
possible high and volatile international oil prices, as well as the security concerns in the country. 
The impact of high oil prices is manifold. It increases the import bill: widens the current account deficit: 
adversely impacts on the exchange rate stability; raises domestic fuel prices causing a serious supply 
side shock; and raises both headline and core inflation since domestic inflation becomes adverse with 
the  demand  pressure  in  the  economy  and  supply  side  shocks.  At  a  time  when  the  entire  world  is 
strengthening its security capabilities to meet the threat against terrorism, Sri Lanka too would need to 
address  the  prevailing  situation.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  important  that  the  business  community 
continues  with  its  investment  plans  in  Sri  Lanka  because  the  very  concerns  regarding  security 
provides a certain “discount” which could be of advantage in a highly competitive global business field. 
External and internal shocks and vulnerabilities may also thrust fresh challenges to financial system 
stability. Hence, it would be useful to consider a few such shocks and risks as well. 
The continuing high growth in private sector credit could also pose threats to price as well as financial 
system  stability.  First,  it  could  deteriorate  the  quality  of  the  assets  of  commercial  banks  and  that 
situation could increase the risk of high non-performing loans in the future. Second, such expansion of 
credit could generate inflationary pressures in the economy through increased aggregate demand. 
With the rapid and intense integration of the Sri Lankan economy with global financial markets, money 
laundering, terrorist financing and pyramid schemes could threaten financial stability.

 BIS Review 8/2007
Therefore, continued regulatory vigilance and timely interventions would be necessary to avoid and/or 
mitigate any harmful effects of all such threats. 
It should also be noted that a continuing high budget deficit could also pose a formidable challenge in 
the  conduct  of  monetary  policy,  as  such  deficit  requires  borrowings  by  the  Government  from  the 
banking system, making it difficult to maintain the monetary expansion along a pre-determined, tight 
path. 
As  seen  from  the  case  studies  of  many  successful  countries,  rapid  infrastructure  development  is  a 
strong contributory factor towards achieving sustainable high growth. However, the timely mobilisation 
of necessary resources for infrastructure development while maintaining budget deficits and debt at 
reasonable levels would be particularly challenging for a developing country like Sri Lanka. 
At the same time, maintaining a comfortable and reasonable level of foreign currency reserves in order 
to  be  able  to  mitigate  the  impacts  of  external  shocks  is  also  a  challenging  task  for  any  developing 
country.  Needless  to  say,  it  is  vital  to  manage  the  foreign  reserves  at  an  appropriate  level,  while 
ensuring  that  the  exchange  rate  fluctuations  are  within  reasonable  limits,  in  order  to  enhance  the 
confidence in the economy. 
These and other challenges would need to be faced by our country and it is clear that our policies and 
actions would have to be so designed in order to deal with, and respond to, such challenges if we are 
to be successful. 
Monetary policy strategy in 2007 and beyond 
5.  
Monetary  policy  is  the  mechanism  that  is  used  by  central  banks  all  over  the  world  to  direct  an 
economy along a non-inflationary, growth path. Such policy would ideally be supported by a series of 
other policies and strategies as well. The policy framework adopted by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka 
is  a  monetary  targeting  framework  with  reserve  money  as  the  operational  target  and  broad 
money (M2b) as the intermediate target1. 
Such targets are carefully computed and set after taking into consideration, the potential growth and 
after  assessing  the  liquidity  needs  of  the  economy  to  move  along  the  projected  growth  path  while 
keeping  inflationary  pressures  in  check.  The  veracity  and  accuracy  of  the  values  derived  from  the 
computation  of  the  demand  for  money  and  the  value  of  the  money  multiplier2  are  important 
prerequisites for effective monetary targeting. 
In  that  context,  it  is  important  to  note  that  in  Sri  Lanka,  there  is  a  stable  relationship  between  the 
operational target, i.e., reserve money, and the intermediate target, i.e., broad money, with the money 
multiplier  consistently  remaining  around  5  during  the  recent  past.  The  long-term  relationship  of 
monetary aggregates and inflation also indicates that money would be a useful leading indicator for 
inflation. Hence, we believe that monetary targeting could continue to be an effective framework for Sri 
Lanka in the short to medium term. 
In  2001,  Sri  Lanka  moved  to  a  “Floating  exchange  rate”  regime  thereby  allowing  market  forces  to 
largely  determine  the  exchange  rate.  The  floating  exchange  rate  system  has  served  well  in  the 
conduct  of  monetary  policy.  As  in  the  past,  the  Central  Bank  interventions  in  the  foreign  exchange 
market would  be  limited  to  building up  the  international reserve  position  and  to  stabilise  any  undue 
fluctuations in the foreign exchange market due to excess or shortage of international currencies. 
As per available international data, the global economy is projected to grow at around 5 per cent in 
2006 and is expected to moderate to around 4.7 per cent in 2007. Sri Lanka’s major export markets 
such as the United States of America (USA) and the Euro area and other trading partners are also 
expected  to  grow  at  healthy  rates.  It  is  therefore  likely  that  the  continuation  of  favourable  global 
economic conditions will generate healthy external demand for Sri Lanka’s goods and services. 
Based on the external and internal factors, the Sri Lankan economy is expected to grow by 7.5 per 
cent in 2007. Growth is also expected to be broad-based, with all three sectors, Agriculture, Industry 
                                                      
1   Broad Money (M2b) is complied consolidating the operations of the Central Bank and operations of domestic banking units

and Services, poised to grow at healthy rates. The government’s planned infrastructure projects in the 
areas of road development, port and airport development, power generation and social infrastructure 
development, would also facilitate sustainable and broad-based growth. 
The  external  sector  is  expected  to  perform  well  in  2007  recording  an  overall  balance  of  payments 
surplus  of  about  US  dollars  200  million,  boosting  the  level  of  official  reserves  to  US  dollars  2,650 
million or about 3 months of imports. Export growth is expected to continue in 2007 at around 10 per 
cent, benefiting from continuing high growth in the global economy, and opportunities offered by Free 
Trade Agreements. Imports are projected to grow at a higher rate of 12 per cent, reflecting increased 
demand for intermediate and investment goods. 
The  Government’s  Medium  Term  Macro  Framework  (MTMF)  enunciated  in  the  Fiscal  Management 
Report 2007, indicates that the overall deficit in 2007 will be contained at around 7.2 per cent of GDP. 
To  meet  this  target,  adjustments  have  to  be  introduced  in  the  areas  of  enhancing  revenue  through 
additional  measures  and  improved  tax  administration,  rationalisation  of  current  expenditure  and 
improvements in the government debt management. Public investment will also need to be maintained 
at a high level to provide complementary capital for private sector investment. 
In this background, the growth in Reserve money and Broad money for 2007 will need to be clearly 
targeted to support the smooth functioning of the economy while preventing the build-up of inflationary 
pressures and expectations. 
Accordingly,  the  2007  Monetary  Programme  has  been  designed  to  accommodate  the  expected 
economic growth of 7.5 per cent and the BOP surplus of US dollars 200 million while aiming to contain 
inflation at 8.5 per cent, as measured by the GDP deflator. It is also assumed that the velocity and 
multiplier would be around 2.52 and 5.2 respectively. 
While  a  significant  moderation  in  inflation  as  measured  by  the  Colombo  Consumers’  Price  Index 
(CCPI) is expected during the year, the Central Bank would be closely monitoring the CCPI behaviour 
in order to respond effectively to any unfavourable developments. While we believe that the tightening 
of monetary policy during the year should be mainly directed to contain private sector credit growth to 
a moderate degree, it is hoped that government borrowings from the banking sector too will be limited 
to the budgeted target of Rs. 16.7 billion. On the supply side, the expansion of production together 
with improved distribution systems is expected to have a favourable impact on prices. With regard to 
the  key  external  factors,  we  anticipate  that  international  prices  of  major  non-fuel  consumer  imports 
would  decline  during  the  year  while  the  impact  of  international  oil  prices  on  the  economy  will  be 
contained to some degree through appropriate hedging mechanisms. 
Based upon the aforementioned assumptions and trends, the Reserve money target for end 2007 has 
been computed  by  allowing  the  necessary  increase from  that  as targeted  at  the  end  2006  value  to 
accommodate the expected GDP growth of 7.5 per cent, inflation of 8.5 per cent, and an extra 1.6 per 
cent to cover the change in velocity, a total of 17.6 per cent. The Broad money (M2b) target too, has 
been computed by applying the properties of the Quantity Equation, the inflation target and expected 
economic growth3. 
The  Reserve  money  growth  will  be  facilitated  by  two  major  developments,  the  change  in  the  Net 
Foreign  Assets  and  the  change  in  the  Net  Domestic  Assets  of  the  Central  Bank.  The  Net  Foreign 
Assets of the Central Bank have been determined by the expected BOP surplus of US dollars 200 
million. 
As  already  explained,  the  planned  monetary  programme  requires  the  Reserve  money  growth  to  be 
maintained at 17.6 per cent from the targeted level of Reserve money as at the end of 2006. At the 
same time, the expected reserve build up of the Central Bank indicates an increase in Net Foreign 
Assets of the Central Bank by Rs. 21 billion while the Net Credit to the Government from the Central 
Bank will increase by Rs 11.5 billion, which includes provisional advances of Rs 12.5 billion, and a 
decline of Treasury bills by Rs. 1.0 billion. 
                                                      
3   A crucial factor in developing the monetary programme is the assumptions in velocity of money and money multiplier. In the 
recent past the velocity has been declining, while multiplier has hovered between 5.0-5.2. In 2007, this trend is expected to 
continue.

The  programme  also  allows  for  a  Broad  money  growth  of  17.6  per  cent  from  the  targeted  level  of 
Broad money at end 2006. This will reflect an increase in Net Foreign Assets of the banking system of 
US dollars 200 million, and increase in private sector credit by Rs 147.3 billion (15.5 per cent) and net 
credit  to  Government  by  Rs  16.7  billion.  To  maintain  the  overall  increase  in  net  credit  to  the 
Government at Rs 16.7 billion, net credit to the Government from commercial banks would need to be 
maintained at Rs 5.2 billion. 
The  Central  Bank  expects  to  direct  economic  activities  and  outcomes  within  its  control  to  meet  the 
Reserve money and Broad money targets. Such activities would include changes to the policy interest 
rates 
if  considered  necessary,  conduct  of  open  market  operations,  moral  suasion,  public 
communications and other available actions. Regular reviews of the general policy stance will also be 
made and intensive public awareness campaigns would be used to manage inflation expectations. 
In  response  to  our  policy  measures  and  actions,  we  believe  that  both  headline  inflation  and  core 
inflation would moderate. It is also our belief that inflation will respond over the months in the manner 
as  set  out  in  the  charts  that  follow,  but  nevertheless  we  shall  be  watching  developments  with  very 
keen interest.

 The Monetary Programme for 2008 and beyond will be based on the high growth path targeted by the 
government in the medium term, and containing money supply to maintain inflation at a low level. In 
this context, inflation will be targeted to gradually decrease to a level of 4 per cent within a 10 year 
time period. Such a target would be in line with the Government’s 10 year plan. The achievement of 
such a target will be facilitated by continued economic growth resulting from high public and private 
investment and savings, improving competitiveness, gradually rationalised expenditure which leaves 
sufficient  funds  for  development  work,  and  reducing  the  budget  deficit  resulting  in  low  demand 
pressure.  Needless  to  say,  the  Central  Bank  will  actively  support  strategies  that  ensure  such 
outcomes. 
In addition, transparency of monetary policy decisions and operations will be maintained to enhance 
the policy effectiveness and during the year we will also seek the views and advise of experts in the 
field of economics and on macroeconomic management in order to benefit by their expertise in our 
monetary policy decision making process. Further, as done in the past, the policy announcements will 
continue to be made according to an advance announcement calendar, and the Calendar for 2007 is 
set out below.

 BIS Review 8/2007
Policies for financial system stability in 2007 and beyond 
6.  
The Central Bank has just issued the Financial Stability Report for 2006, which clearly indicates that 
the financial system in Sri Lanka is resilient and that there are no imminent threats that may endanger 
its stability. The report however contains information regarding certain possible risks and those will of 
course need to be attended to by the relevant authorities in due course. The resilience of the financial 
system is underlined by the robustness of the macro-economy, soundness of systemically important 
financial institutions, healthy developments in financial markets, sound supervision and oversight, and 
continuation of a safe payment and settlement system. 
At the same time, a series of measures will need to be implemented to further enhance the efficiency 
and  strengthen  the  financial  sector,  which  will  contribute  to  financial  system  stability.  These 
encompass  regulatory  and  supervisory  measures  of  major  financial  institutions;  forward  looking 
surveillance indicators and tools to predict emerging vulnerabilities; measures to improve efficiency of 
financial markets including access to finance; initiatives to enhance the safety of payment systems; 
and introduction of necessary changes to legal enactments governing the wider financial system. 
In general, the aim will be to promote an adequate level of competition in the banking industry, while 
ensuring that the banks are capable of adding value to the economy and expanding in order to serve 
presently  underbanked  areas  of  the  country.  In  keeping  with  such  aim,  the  overall  policy  thrust  of 
banking supervision and regulation will be to promote higher standards of risk management among 
banking institutions. Towards such end, the Central Bank has already implemented several measures 
to further strengthen the supervision and regulation and these include: 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
Introduction of enhanced minimum capital requirements, 
Introduction of the market risk factor in the computation of capital adequacy, 
Introduction  of  conditions  for  the  quarterly  publication  of  financial  performance  indicators, 
and 
(d) 
Introduction of provisioning requirements in the banking sector to cover potential credit risk.  
Prudential requirements imposed on banks will also be further strengthened in 2007. This will include 
the  introduction  of  a  general  provision  on  performing  advances  and  increasing  the  provisioning 
requirement for non performing loans; increasing the risk weights on residential mortgage loans and 
‘other’  loans  adopted  in  the  capital  adequacy  computation;  and  the  revision  of  the  Single  Borrower 
Limit in line with improved risk management by banks. 
In addition, the Central Bank intends to implement Basel II, the new international capital framework in 
2008, with a standardised approach which will help better align a bank’s capital with its risk profile, 
enhance  risk  management  and  increase  market  discipline  due  to  the  need  for  greater  market 
disclosure. Through such actions, it is expected to enhance the stability of the banking system and 
thereby provide greater confidence to all stakeholders and the general public. 
It is also our intention to change the supervision of the banking institutions from “compliance based’’ 
systems to a “risk focused” systems, whereby a corrective action plan is consistently applied across 
the  industry.  This  will  necessitate  banks  to  develop  integrated  risk  management  systems  and 
strengthen  internal  controls  and  procedures,  in  line  with  more  advanced  prudential  requirements. 
Banks  will  also  be  required  to  set  up  integrated  risk  management  mechanisms  and  begin  ‘stress 
testing’ to assess their resilience to internal and external shocks, in order to facilitate the identification 
of risks and to initiate corrective measures. 
The  supervision  and  regulation  of  non-bank  financial  institutions  will  also  be  strengthened  by 
enhancing  the  minimum  capital  requirement  of  such  institutions.  This  will  facilitate  the  non-bank 
financial  institutions  to  enhance  resilience  and  expand  their  business  activities.  Accordingly,  the 
existing finance companies will have to increase their core capital to Rs. 100 million by 31 January 
2007 and to Rs. 200 million by 30 June 2008. 
Further,  the  regulatory  framework  of  registered  leasing  establishments  will  also  be  further 
strengthened by carrying on comprehensive on-site examinations of selected leasing establishments 
and spot examinations of the others on a regular basis. 
In  addition,  in  order  to  enhance  the  orderliness  in  the  business  of  money  changing,  the  minimum 
annual  turnover  required  to  be  considered  for  the  renewal  of  the  money  changing  permits  will  be 
increased  from  US  dollars  120,000  to  US  dollars  600,000  with  effect  from  1st  January  2007.  At  the 
BIS Review8/2007 
 11
same time, to enhance the scope of operations of money changers, they will be granted approval to 
encash Travellers' Cheques from 2007 onwards. 
As  is  being  done  internationally,  a  close  cooperation  will  also  be  maintained  among  all  relevant 
supervisory  and  regulatory  institutions  to  facilitate  the  supervision  and  regulation  of  financial 
conglomerates. In this regard, a Working Group of Regulators for Financial Conglomerates comprising 
the Central Bank, Insurance Board of Sri Lanka, Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka, 
Sri Lanka Accounting and Auditing Standards Monitoring Board and the Department of Registrar of 
Companies has already been established to develop a mechanism of monitoring the systemic risk of 
conglomerates. 
In the meantime, the Payment and Settlement Policy has already been drafted in consultation with the 
National  Payment  Council,  to  mitigate  risks  and  increase  efficiency.  The  proposed  policy  will  be 
implemented during 2007-2010. 
A local SWIFT Service Bureau will be set up in 2007 to provide a common connectivity point for users 
to communicate with SWIFTNet from the Disaster Recovery Site. 
The coverage of the Wide Area Network will be expanded by including the Primary Dealers to resolve 
the remaining problems relating to registering all investor transactions in the Securities Depository of 
the  Central  Bank.  This  will  further  enhance  the  safety  of  investments  in  the  government  securities 
market. The Central Bank will permit Primary Dealers to diversify their business into certain activities 
and within limits, with appropriate regulatory and prudential safeguards. 
Some  of  the  Primary  Dealers  who  are  dealing  outside  the  Scripless  Securities  Settlement  System 
could have caused potential threats to the system. This may have been particularly due to the fact that 
using SWIFT was considered to be an expensive method of transferring data. Therefore, the Central 
Bank  has  now  introduced  a  low  cost  method  of  transferring  data  using  the  Wide  Area  Network 
connecting  them with  the Central  Bank.  Accordingly,  all  Primary Dealers  are now  urged  to  use  this 
method to ensure retail transactions are not proceeded outside the system. 
Two  new  laws,  namely  the  Prevention  of  Money  Laundering  Act  No.  5  of  2006  and  the  Financial 
Transactions Reporting Act No. 6 of 2006 have been enacted last year to prevent money laundering 
and  terrorist  financing  and  to  strengthen  the  reporting  mechanism  for  financial  transactions.  Arising 
from  such  initiative,  the  Financial  Intelligence  Unit  has  already  been  established  to  investigate  and 
take  action  to  combat  money  laundering  and  terrorist  financing. The work  of the  FIU will be  further 
expanded during the year 2007. 
In line with the global trends, we will be taking steps to further promote corporate governance in the 
financial sector by implementing several measures. Mandatory corporate governance rules covering 
important areas of corporate governance principles will be introduced in place of the existing voluntary 
codes. 
Measures will also be taken to increase awareness and educate the public on important information 
such as comprehensive lists of financial institutions authorised to accept deposits by the public and 
particulars about those that are being regulated by the Central Bank. 
Share ownership of banks will be broad-based to promote better corporate governance and to reduce 
the  concentration  of  ownership  and  to  address  conflicts  of  interest  that  may  arise  due  to  large 
shareholdings. New policies on share ownership will be issued shortly, where a single entities’ material 
share ownership would be generally limited to 15 per cent of a bank’s share capital. 
A revised format for publication of banks’ financial statements in their annual reports will be introduced 
so as to improve disclosure requirements and provide more information to market participants. The 
Central Bank will also facilitate the adoption of the internationally accepted accounting and reporting 
standards such as IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 by banks. A continuous dialogue will be maintained with 
the  external  auditors  and  other  relevant  institutions  with  respect  to  the  operations  of  banks,  the 
publication of accounts and adoption of international accounting standards. 
The Central Bank’s currency management policies are also being formulated to ensure that Sri Lankan 
Rupee  notes  and  coins  are  available  to  the  public  in  required  denominations  upon  demand.  In 
achieving this, the Bank will forecast the currency demand and maintain a buffer stock of currency to 
meet the seasonal and any contingent demand. As in the past, the currency management policy of the 
Central Bank will be focused on maintaining quality standards. In this effort, continuous upgrading of 
security  features  mainly  in  high  denomination  notes,  conducting  aggressive  public  awareness 
programmes, especially for cash handlers of commercial banks, counterfeiting aspects and clean note 
12 
 BIS Review 8/2007
policy will be the main tools in achieving the quality standards. Advocating the clean note policy, the 
Central Bank presently withdraws unserviceable banknotes from circulation regularly and issues new 
or serviceable notes through the banking system. 
Another  matter  of  some  concern  is  the  steadily  rising  outstanding  and  overdue  balances  on  credit 
cards. In this regard, the Central Bank intends to introduce prudential guidelines on the issuance and 
the minimum repayment requirements on credit cards so as to ensure that credit card operations do 
not threaten financial system stability. 
At the same time, the Central Bank has noted with satisfaction that the imposition of the 50 per cent 
margin  on  DA  term  imports  is  deriving  its  desired  results.  If  this  trend  continues  and  the  desired 
outcome is achieved, this measure will be withdrawn by 31st March 2007. 
In  addition  to  the  initiatives  and  programmes  as  already  enunciated  we  also  believe  that  the 
appropriate  legal  and  regulatory  framework  supporting  financial  system  stability  needs  to  be  further 
strengthened  if  we  are  to  address  potential  future  issues  in  a  timely  manner.  Accordingly,  suitable 
amendments are to be proposed to the existing legislation pertaining to banking. A summary of such 
proposed revisions are: 
• 
Debt  Recovery  Law:  to  expedite  the  recovery  process  and  create  a  creditor  friendly 
environment 
Asset  Management  Company  Law:  to  enable  the  speedier  resolution  of  non  performing 
loans of a failed bank 
Credit Information Bureau Act: to widen the scope of the Credit Information Bureau and to 
provide greater (including positive) credit information 
Computer Crimes Law: to reduce any potential risks that may arise through computer frauds. 
Micro  Finance  Institutions  Act:  The  proposed  Act  envisages  to  bring  all  micro  finance 
institutions under the regulatory framework. The licensing and supervising authority will be 
the Monetary Board while arrangements will be made to delegate the supervisory functions 
to agents. 
Finance Leasing Act: The finance leasing law will be amended to permit strongly capitalised 
leasing companies to mobilise funds from the public through the issue of debt instruments. 
This  will  enable  them  to  broaden  their  funding  sources  and  to  expand  their  operations 
prudently. 
Finance Companies Act: The law will be strengthened to bring in more stringent provisions 
for  dealing  with  unregistered  businesses  and  persons  carrying  on  finance  business,  in 
contravention of the laws. 
Business Recovery Law: Law proposed to provide a procedure for the resuscitation of sick 
industries. 
      Policies for strengthening the economy 
7.  
Among the fundamental requirements in strengthening the economy are high savings and investment. 
Savings  are  encouraged  by  strengthening  the  financial  system  and  delivering  positive  real  interest 
rates  through  appropriate  monetary  policy  measures.  The  Central  Banks’  contribution  to  promoting 
investment will be somewhat indirect and will mainly arise from the business confidence that would be 
generated as a result of maintaining low inflation and minimising the macroeconomic risks. 
Currently,  the  Central  Bank  managed  Employees’  Provident  Fund  (EPF)  plays  a  significant  role  in 
supplying  both  equity  and  debt  capital  to  the  private  sector  as  well  as  the  Government,  while 
generating optimum long term returns for members. The Central Bank will continue to fulfill this role 
and  supply  equity  and  debt  capital  in  2007  by  carefully  evaluating  investment  opportunities  and  a 
gradual  diversification  of  investments.  In  addition,  the  service  provided  to  the  presently  active  two 
million members will be enhanced through a comprehensive reengineering programme of the EPF by 
fully automating its operations, using electronic means to update the member accounts in real time. 
The Central Bank will also actively explore the possibility of introducing a unified voluntary contributory 
social security scheme for over three million informal sector workers. This will provide a social security 
to these workers, while generating large scale savings and funds for investment as well. 
BIS Review8/2007 
 13
In keeping with the vision of the Central Bank, access to finance by all segments of the population will 
be improved through continued development of the finance sector. Accordingly, the Central Bank will 
continue to promote development initiatives through co-ordinating credit delivery activities among the 
government, financial institutions, foreign donors and beneficiaries. In 2007, the Bank will expand its 
outreach  under  existing  micro  finance  programmes,  for  families  in  poverty  in  various  parts  of  the 
country,  with  the  assistance  of  lending  institutions  and  other  support  groups.  New  and  improved 
poverty  focused  micro  finance programmes will be developed  through  self-help  group  mechanisms, 
while encouraging savings habits and ensuring credit availability for diverse economic opportunities. 
The Central Bank has also recognised the vital importance of foreign remittances in supplying funds 
for investment. Thus, the Central Bank will continue to assist both the Bureau of Foreign Employment 
and the banking sector to attract remittances to Sri Lanka through the formal banking channels. The 
ambitious  awareness  campaign  embarked  by  the  Central  Bank  in  2006  will  continue  with  greater 
interest in 2007, with the aim of raising the level and quantities of remittances significantly. 
We  will  also  continue  in  our  efforts  to  support  financial  markets  during  the  year.  The  public  debt 
management  policy  of  the  Central  Bank  will  be  reformulated  to  develop  and  strengthen  the 
government securities market, enhance the efficiency in the debt market and access to finance, and 
maintain a proper balance between commercial borrowings from local and external sources. Towards 
such objective, the Central Bank will continue in its efforts to strengthen the intermediary participants 
in  the  government  securities  market,  and  continue  with  the  debt  consolidation  process  while 
expanding the investor base in government securities. 
Concluding remarks 
8.  
The Central Bank’s vision is to continue being a credible and dynamic institution contributing to the 
prosperity of Sri Lanka. In that endeavour, we will strive to effectively utilise the productive resources 
of our country by maintaining economic, price and financial system stability, and offering sound policy 
advice to the government. Further, in keeping with our values, the Central Bank will also continue to 
maintain transparency by announcing its policies to the public, which will, in turn, enhance the policy 
effectiveness. 
Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentleman, we do hope our statement to you today helped to clarify 
our policies and would assist you in your economic endeavours. May we also assure you that, we, at 
the Central Bank remain deeply committed to contributing towards the prosperity of our country and 
appreciate very much your endeavours that are directed towards such goal. 
It is our wish and hope that the year 2007 will be a highly successful year for all of us and we offer you 
our closest co-operation and support. Once again, I wish all of you a Happy, Prosperous and Peaceful 
New Year.
