Rakesh Mohan: Development of financial markets in India  
Address  by  Dr  Rakesh  Mohan,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India,  at  the  First 
Indian-French Financial Forum, Mumbai, 16 May 2007.  
The assistance of Janak Raj, Jai Chander and Partha Ray in preparing this address is gratefully acknowledged. 
 I am delighted to have the opportunity of speaking on the issue of development of financial markets 
along  with  Mr.  Christian  Noyer,  Governor  of  the  Banque  de  France.  He  has  displayed  a  deep 
commitment to the development of financial markets over the years and we heard a very thoughtful 
speech  from  him  on  this  subject  at  the  Reserve  Bank  just  two  days  ago.  His  approach  to  financial 
markets  is  marked  by  a  great  degree  of  pragmatism:  as  we  develop  financial  markets  we  need  to 
make sure that they serve our needs, and we have to be equally conscious of the risks that they can 
generate if not managed well. 
I welcome this opportunity to document the development of financial markets in India over the past 
decade and a half. With acceleration in economic growth in the country, the step up in savings and 
investments,  and  expanded  horizons  of  market  participants,  along  with  renewed  thinking  on  fuller 
capital  account  convertibility,  discussion  on  financial  market  development  has  assumed  a  new 
urgency. 
What are the key objectives of financial market development? From our point of view, the basic aim of 
financial market development must be to aid economic growth and development. The primary role of 
financial  markets,  broadly  interpreted,  is  to  intermediate  resources  from  savers  to  investors,  and 
allocate them in an efficient manner among competing uses in the economy, thereby contributing to 
growth both through increased investment and through enhanced efficiency in resource use. 
The Reserve Bank has taken a proactive role in the development of financial markets, particularly over 
the  past  decade  and  a  half  of  overall  economic  policy  reforms.  There  has  been  a  complete 
transformation  of  the  money  market,  the  government  securities  market,  and  the  foreign  exchange 
market over this period. Development of these markets has been done in a calibrated, sequenced and 
careful manner in step with those in other markets in the real economy. The sequencing has also been 
informed  by  the  need  to  develop  market  infrastructure,  technology  and  capabilities  of  market 
participants and financial institutions in a consistent manner. In a low income economy like ours, the 
cost of downside risk is very high, so the objective of maintaining financial stability has to be constantly 
kept in view as we develop financial markets. What I would like to do today is to briefly recount the 
measures  taken  to  develop  various  financial  markets  in  India,  document  the  outcomes  and  broadly 
sketch out the direction of the way forward. 
From  the  point  of  view  of  the  central  bank,  developed  financial  markets  are  critical  for  effective 
transmission of monetary policy impulses to the rest of the economy. Monetary transmission cannot 
take  place  without  efficient  price  discovery,  particularly  with  respect  to  interest  rates  and  exchange 
rates. Deep and liquid financial markets contribute to efficient price discovery in various segments of 
the  financial  market.  Well-integrated  markets  improve  efficacy  of  policy  impulses  by  enabling  quick 
transmission of changes in the central bank’s short-term policy rate to the entire spectrum of market 
rates,  both  short  and  long-term,  in  the  money,  the  credit  and  the  bond  markets.  However,  various 
benefits emanating from the functioning of the financial markets depend critically upon the resilience of 
various segments of the market to withstand shocks and the strength of the risk management systems 
in place. In view of the critical role played by the financial markets in financing the growing needs of 
various sectors of the economy, it is important that financial markets are developed further and well-
integrated.  
In recognition of the critical role of the financial markets, the initiation of the structural reforms in the 
early  1990s  in  India  also  encompassed  a  process  of  phased  and  coordinated  deregulation  and 
liberalisation of financial markets. Financial markets in India in the period before the early 1990s were 
marked by administered interest rates, quantitative ceilings, statutory pre-emptions, captive market for 
government  securities,  excessive  reliance  on  central  bank  financing,  pegged  exchange  rate,  and 
current  and  capital  account  restrictions.  As  a  result  of  various  reforms,  the  financial  markets  have 
transited  to  a  regime  characterised  by  market-determined  interest  and  exchange  rates,  price-based 
instruments of monetary policy, current account convertibility, phased capital account liberalisation and 
an auction-based system in the government securities market.

Excessive fluctuations and volatility in financial markets can mask the underlying value and give rise to 
confusing  signals,  thereby  hindering  efficient  price  discovery.  Accordingly,  policy  efforts  have  also 
aimed at ensuring orderly conditions in financial markets. Furthermore, deregulation, liberalisation, and 
globalisation of financial markets pose several risks to financial stability. Financial markets are often 
governed by herd behaviour and contagion and excessive competition among financial institutions can 
also lead to a race to the bottom. The East Asian crisis of the 1990s suggested that global financial 
markets  can  exacerbate  domestic  vulnerabilities.  Notwithstanding  the  conventional  wisdom  that 
financial markets punish deviations from prudent policies, financial markets, at times, seem to tolerate 
imprudent  behaviour  for  a  remarkable  stretch  of  time,  while  reacting  pre-maturely  at  other  times 
(Lipschitz,  2007).  In  recognition  of  these  possible  destabilising  factors,  while  liberalising  domestic 
financial markets in India, appropriate prudential safeguards have also been put in place. Enhancing 
efficiency, while at the same time avoiding instability in the system, has been the challenge for the 
regulators in India (Reddy, 2004). This approach to development and regulation of financial markets 
has imparted resilience to the financial markets. 
From the point of view of the economy as a whole, while developing financial markets it is essential to 
keep  in  view  how  such  development  helps overall growth  and  development.  The  price  discovery of 
interest  rates  and  exchange  rates,  and  the  integration  of  such  prices  across  markets  helps  in  the 
efficient allocation of resources in the real sectors of the economy. Financial intermediaries like banks 
also gain from better determination of interest rates in financial markets so that they can price their 
own products better. Moreover, their own risk management can also improve through the availability of 
different varieties of financial instruments. The access of real sector entities to finance is also assisted 
by the appropriate development of the financial market and the availability of transparent information 
on benchmark interest rates and prevailing exchange rates. The approach of the Reserve Bank in the 
development of financial markets has been guided by these considerations, while also keeping in view 
the  availability  of  appropriate  skills  and  capacities  for  participation  in  financial  markets  both  among 
financial market participants and real sector entities and inpiduals. 
The  Reserve  Bank's  approach  has  therefore  been  one  of  consistent  development  of  markets  while 
exercising caution in favour of maintaining financial stability in the system. 
Money market 
The Reserve Bank has accorded prime attention to the development of the money market as it is the 
key link in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to financial markets and finally, to the real 
economy  (Annex  I).  In  the  past,  development  of  the  money  market  was  hindered  by  a  system  of 
administered  interest  rates  and  lack  of  proper  accounting  and  risk  management  systems.  With  the 
initiation of reforms and the transition to indirect, market-based instruments of monetary policy in the 
1990s,  the  Reserve  Bank  made  conscious  efforts  to  develop  an  efficient,  stable  and  liquid  money 
market  by  creating  a  favourable  policy  environment  through  appropriate  institutional  changes, 
instruments, technologies and market practices. Accordingly, the call money market was developed 
into  primarily  an  inter-bank  market,  while  encouraging  other  market  participants  to  migrate  towards 
collateralised segments of the market, thereby increasing overall market integrity. 
In  line  with  the  objective  of  widening  and  deepening  of  the  money  market  and  imparting  greater 
liquidity to the market for facilitating efficient price discovery, new instruments, such as collateralised 
lending and borrowing obligations (CBLO), have been introduced. Money market instruments such as 
market  repo  and  CBLO  have  provided  avenues  for  non-banks  to  manage  their  short-term  liquidity 
mismatches and facilitated the transformation of the call money market into a pure inter-bank market. 
Furthermore,  issuance  norms  and  maturity  profiles  of  other  money  market  instruments  such  as 
commercial paper (CP) and certificate of deposits (CDs) have been modified over time to encourage 
wider  participation  while  strengthening  the  transmission  of  policy  signals  across  the  various  market 
segments. The abolition of ad hoc Treasury Bills and introduction of regular auctions of Treasury Bills 
paved the way for the emergence of a risk free rate, which has become a benchmark for pricing the 
other  money  market  instruments.  Concomitantly,  with  the  increased  market  orientation  of  monetary 
policy  along with  greater global  integration  of  domestic  markets,  the  Reserve  Bank’s  emphasis  has 
been  on  setting  prudential  limits  on  borrowing  and  lending  in  the  call  money  market,  encouraging 
migration  towards  the  collateralised  segments  and  developing  derivative  instruments  for  hedging 
market risks. This has been complemented by the institutionalisation of the Clearing Corporation of 
India Limited (CCIL) as a central counterparty. The upgradation of payment system technologies has 
also enabled market participants to improve their asset liability management. All these measures have 
2 
 BIS Review 51/2007
widened  and  deepened  the  money  market  in  terms  of  instruments  and  participants,  enhanced 
transparency  and  improved  the  signalling  mechanism  of  monetary  policy  while  ensuring  financial 
stability.  
These policy initiatives over time have led to the development of a relatively deep, liquid and vibrant 
money market in the country. Activity in all the segments has increased significantly, especially during 
the last three years. With the development of market repo and CBLO segments, the call money market 
has  been  transformed  into  a  pure  inter-bank  market  from  August  2005.  A  recent  noteworthy 
development is the substantial migration of money market activity from the uncollateralised call money 
segment  to  the  collateralised  market  repo  and  CBLO  markets.  Thus,  uncollateralised  overnight 
transactions are now limited to banks and primary dealers in the interest of financial stability (Table 1).  
Volatility  in  call  rates  has  declined  over  the  years,  especially  after  the  introduction  of  the  Liquidity 
Adjustment  Facility  (LAF).  Under  the  LAF,  the  Reserve  Bank  sets  its  policy  rates,  i.e.,  repo  and 
reverse  repo  rates  and  carries  out  repo/reverse  repo  operations,  thereby  providing  a  corridor  for 
overnight  money  market  rates.  The  weighted  average  overnight  rate  has  largely  moved  within  the 
corridor set by LAF rates, barring some occasions, especially in recent months (Chart 1). 
 
 
The  operating  framework  of  monetary  policy  has  been  the  maintenance  of  overnight  market  rates 
within an interest rate corridor defined by the floor of the reverse repo (absorption) rate and ceiling of 
the repo (injection) rate. During periods of system wide excess liquidity, overnight rates tend to hug the 
bottom of the corridor, while touching the ceiling during other periods of liquidity shortage, as might be 
expected. Increased volatility in capital flows, tending to inject excess liquidity into the system, and in 
government  cash  balances  resulting  from  bunching  of  tax  payments  that  suck  liquidity  out  of  the 
system,  have  made  the  task  of  liquidity  management  somewhat  more  difficult  over  the  past  year. 
Consequently, volatility in overnight rates has increased in recent months relative to previous years, 
with overnight rates breaching both ends of the corridor.

After the adoption of the full-fledged LAF in June 2000, call rates, in general, witnessed a declining 
trend up to 2004-05. The institution of LAF has also enabled the Reserve Bank to manage liquidity 
more  efficiently  and  reduce  volatility  in  call  rates.  Volatility,  measured  by  the  coefficient  of  variation 
(CV) of call rates, has declined significantly in the current decade as compared with that in the 1990s 
(Chart 2), with some increase in 2006-07, as already noted.

 BIS Review 51/2007
  
The  reduction  in  bid-ask  spread  in  the  overnight  rates  indicates  that  the  Indian  money  market  has 
become  reasonably  deep,  vibrant  and  liquid.  During  April  2004−February  2007,  the  bid-ask  spread 
has  varied  within  a  range  of  -0.37  to  +1.32  basis  points  with  an  average  of  16  basis  points  and 
standard deviation (SD) of 11 basis points (coefficient of variation being 68.8). Despite a higher degree 
of variation, however, the bid-ask spread remained within the 2-SD band around the average during 
most of the period (Chart 3).  
 
   As  a  result  of  various  reform  measures,  the  money  market  in  India  has  undergone  significant 
transformation  in  terms  of  volume,  number  of  instruments and participants  and  development  of  risk 
management  practices.  In  line  with  the  shifts  in  policy  emphasis,  various  segments  of  the  money 
market have acquired greater depth and liquidity. The price discovery process has also improved. The 
call  money  market  has  been  transformed  into  a  pure  inter-bank  market,  while  other  money  market 
instruments  such  as  market  repo  and  CBLO  have  developed  to  provide  avenues  to  non-banks  for 
managing their short-term liquidity mismatches. The money market has also become more efficient as 
is reflected in the narrowing of the bid-ask spread in overnight rates. The abolition of ad hoc Treasury 
Bills and introduction of Treasury Bills auction have led to the emergence of a risk free rate, which acts 
as a benchmark for the pricing of other money market instruments.

Government securities market 
The Reserve Bank has actively pursued the development of the government securities market since 
the early 1990s for a variety of reasons (Annex II). First, with the Reserve Bank acting as the debt 
manager to the Government, a well-developed and liquid government securities market is essential to 
ensure  the  smooth  passage  of  Government’s  market  borrowings  to  finance  its  deficit.  Second,  the 
development of the government securities market is also necessary to facilitate the emergence of a 
risk  free  rupee  yield  curve  to  serve  as  a  benchmark  for  pricing  other  debt  instruments.  Finally,  the 
government  securities  market  plays  a  key  role  in  the  effective  transmission  of  monetary  policy 
impulses in a deregulated environment.  
In order to foster the development of the government securities market, it was imperative to migrate 
from  a  regime  of  administered  interest  rates  to  a  market-oriented  system.  Accordingly,  in  the  early 
1990s,  the  Reserve  Bank  initiated  several  measures.  First,  it  introduced  the  auction  system  for 
issuance  of  government  securities.  While  initially  only  yield-based  multiple  price  auctions  were 
conducted, uniform price-based auctions were also employed during uncertain market conditions and 
while issuing new instruments. Second, as the captive investor base was viewed as constraining the 
development of the market, the statutory prescription for banks’ investments in government and other 
approved securities was scaled down from the peak level in February 1992 to the statutory minimum 
level of 25 per cent by April 1997. As a result, the focus shifted towards the widening of the investor 
base. A network of intermediaries in the form of primary dealers was developed for this purpose. Retail 
participation has been promoted in the primary market (through a system of non-competitive bidding in 
the  auctions)  as  well  as  in  the  secondary  market  (by  allowing  retail  trading  in  stock  exchanges). 
Simultaneously, the Reserve Bank also introduced new instruments with innovative features to cater to 
perse market preferences, although the experience in this regard has not been encouraging.  
Third,  with  the  discontinuance  of  the  process  of  unconstrained  recourse  by  the  Government  to  the 
Reserve Bank through automatic monetisation of deficit and conversion of non-marketable securities 
to marketable securities, the Reserve Bank gained more operational freedom. Fourth, in an effort to 
increase  liquidity,  the  Reserve  Bank  has,  since  the  late  1990s,  pursued  a  strategy  of  passive 
consolidation of debt by raising progressively higher share of market borrowings through re-issuances. 
This  has  resulted  in  critical  mass  in  key  maturities,  and  is  facilitating  the  emergence  of  market 
benchmarks.  Fifth,  improvement  in  overall  macroeconomic  and  monetary  management  that  has 
resulted in lower inflation, lower inflation expectations, and price stability has enabled the elongation of 
the yield curve to maturities upto 30 years. Finally, the Reserve Bank has also undertaken measures 
to strengthen the technological infrastructure for trading and settlement. A screen-based anonymous 
trading and reporting platform has been introduced in the form of NDS-OM, which enables electronic 
bidding  in  primary  auctions  and  disseminates  trading  information  with  a  minimum  time  lag. 
Furthermore,  with  the  setting  up  of  CCIL,  an  efficient  settlement  mechanism  has  also  been 
institutionalised, which has imparted considerable stability to the government securities market.  
With the withdrawal from the primary market from April 1, 2006 in accordance with the FRBM (Fiscal 
Responsibility  and  Budget  Management  Act)  stipulations,  the  Reserve  Bank  introduced  various 
institutional  changes  in  the  form  of  revamping  and  widening  of  the  coverage  of  the  Primary  Dealer 
(PD)  system  to  meet  the  emerging  challenges.  Other  measures  taken  to  deepen  the  market  and 
promote liquidity include introduction of “when issued” trading, “short selling” of government securities 
and active consolidation of government debt through buy backs. Various policy initiatives taken by the 
Reserve  Bank  over  the  years  to  widen  and  deepen  the  government  securities  market  in  terms  of 
instruments  as  well  as  participants  have  enabled  successful  completion  of  market  borrowing 
programmes of the Government under varied circumstances. In particular, a smooth transition to the 
post-FRBM phase has been ensured.  
The  system  of  automatic  monetisation  through  ad  hoc  Treasury  Bills  was  replaced  with  Ways  and 
Means Advances in 1997, because of which the Government resorted to increased market borrowings 
to  finance  its  deficit.  Accordingly,  the  size  of  the  government  securities  market  has  increased 
significantly over the years (Chart 4).  
6 
 BIS Review 51/2007
  
The investor base for government securities, which was largely determined by mandated investment 
requirements  before  reforms,  has  expanded  with  the  voluntary  holding  of  government  securities. 
Accordingly, the share of commercial banks has declined from 2004-05 (Chart 5). 
 
   
The PD system was essentially conceived for institutions whose basic interest is not to hold securities 
but  to  participate  in  the  primary  auctions  with  the  intent  to  act  as  market  makers  in  the  secondary 
market. PDs are responsible for ensuring the success of primary auctions. The presence of PDs in the 
government securities market has brought about an element of dynamism, both in the primary and the 
secondary segments. PDs have been actively participating in the auctions of government securities. 
By  providing  continuous  two-way  quotes,  PDs  act  as  market  makers  in  the  secondary  market.  The 
liquidity in the secondary market, in turn, lends support to the success of primary market operations. 
The  PD  system  has  facilitated  better  distribution  of  primary  auctioned  stock  while  providing  better 
liquidity in the secondary market (Table 2). The decline in the share of PDs in the primary issuances in 
the  recent  period  needs  to  be  seen  in  the  context  of  increased  bidding  interest  by  insurance 
companies, particularly in the long dated securities.

One  of  the  key  issues  in  the  development  of  the  market  for  a  better  price  discovery  is  liquidity  of 
securities. It was observed that, of the universe of a large number of outstanding securities, only a few 
securities are actively traded in the secondary market. The Reserve Bank has been following a policy 
of passive consolidation through re-issuance of existing securities with a view to enhancing liquidity in 
the secondary segment of the government securities market. The share of re-issuances in the total 
securities issued was 97.7 per cent during 2005-06. Active consolidation of government securities has 
also been attempted under the debt buyback scheme introduced in July 2003, which is expected to be 
more actively pursued now.  
As  a  result  of  the  developmental  measures  undertaken,  the  volume  of  transactions  has  increased 
manifold over the past decade (Chart 6).  
 
 
The significant drop in turnover in 2004-05 and 2005-06 could be due to a “buy and hold” tendency of 
the  participants  other  than  commercial  banks,  particularly  insurance  companies,  which  now  hold  a 
substantial portion of government securities, particularly those of longer maturities. The decline could 
 8 
 BIS Review 51/2007
also be attributed to the asymmetric response of investors to the interest rate cycle. In the absence of 
a facility of short selling in government securities, participants generally refrained from taking positions 
which resulted in volumes drying up in a falling market (Chart 7).  
 
 To keep the markets liquid and active even during the bearish times, and more importantly, to give the 
participants  a  tool  to  better  manage  their  interest  rate  risk,  intra-day  short  selling  in  government 
securities  was  permitted  among  eligible  participants,  viz.,  scheduled  commercial  banks  (SCBs)  and 
primary  dealers  (PDs)  in  February  2006.  Subsequently,  the  short  positions  were  permitted  to  be 
carried  beyond  intra-day  for  a  period  of  five  trading  days,  effective  January  31,  2007.  To  further 
improve the liquidity in the government securities market, guidelines for trading in when issued “WI” 
market were issued by the Reserve Bank in May, 2006. Trading in “WI” segment, which commenced 
in  August  2006,  was  initially  permitted  in  reissued  securities.  It  takes  place  from  the  date  of 
announcement of auction till one day prior to allotment of auctioned securities. The revised guidelines 
extending “WI” trading to new issuances of Central Government securities on a selective basis were 
issued in November 2006.  
The Reserve Bank has followed a strategy of elongating the yield curve by issuing a fine blend of long-
term securities along with the short-term to suit the preference of both the issuer and the investor. With 
the issuance of longer term securities, the yield curve on government securities has emerged over a 
spectrum of 30 years, although the yield curve is not liquid at the longer end of the maturity (Chart 8). 
 Thus,  various  measures  undertaken  have  led  to  a  significant  improvement  in  the  functioning  of  the 
government securities market. The primary market has attained a greater resilience, benefiting from 
measures  taken  for  the  development  of  institutions  and  instruments.  The  functioning  of  the 
 BIS Review 51/2007 
 9
government securities market since the mid-1990s indicates consistent increase in its size in tandem 
with the growth in market borrowings of both the Central and the State Governments. Introduction of 
the auction based system has improved the price discovery process. Reflecting the effectiveness of 
various measures to develop the market, the turnover in the secondary market has increased manifold 
over the years. The establishment of settlement and trading infrastructure has also led to increased 
activity in the secondary market. The holding pattern of government debt shows some shift from banks 
to  non-banks,  reflecting  a  progressive  persification  of  the  investor  base.  The  yield  curve  on 
government securities has emerged even as it is yet to become liquid at the longer end of the maturity. 
Thus, the government securities market in India has witnessed a transition to an increasingly broad-
based market, characterised by an efficient auction process, an active secondary market and a liquid 
yield  curve. These  developments  have  aided  the smooth  financing  of  government  debt,  of  both  the 
central government and state governments, even when their fiscal deficits were high and rising. This 
experience has enabled the greater recourse of state governments to market borrowing as mandated 
by the Twelfth Finance Commission.  
Foreign exchange market 
The  Indian  foreign  exchange  market  has  witnessed  far  reaching  changes  since  the  early  1990s 
following the phased transition from a pegged exchange rate regime to a market determined exchange 
rate  regime  in  1993  and  the  subsequent  adoption  of  current  account  convertibility  in  1994  and 
substantial liberalisation of capital account transactions (Annex III). Market participants have also been 
provided with greater flexibility to undertake foreign exchange operations and manage their risks. This 
has been facilitated through simplification of procedures and availability of several new instruments. 
There has also been significant improvement in market infrastructure in terms of trading platform and 
settlement  mechanisms.  As  a  result  of  various  reform  measures,  liquidity  in  the  foreign  exchange 
market increased by more than five times between 1997-98 and 2006-07 (Table 3).  
In relative terms, turnover in the foreign exchange market was 6.6 times the size of India's balance of 
payments during 2005-06 as compared with 5.4 times in 2000-01 (Table 4). With the deepening of the 
foreign  exchange  market  and  increased  turnover,  income  of  commercial  banks  through  such 
transactions increased significantly. Profit from foreign exchange transactions accounted for more than 
20 per cent of total profit of scheduled commercial banks in the last 2 years.

Efficiency  in  the  foreign  exchange  market  has  also  improved  as  reflected  in  the  decline  in  bid-ask 
spreads.  The  bid-ask  spread  of  Rupee/US$  market  has  almost  converged  with  that  of  other  major 
currencies in the international market. On some occasions, in fact, the bid-ask spread of Rupee/US$ 
market was lower than that of some major currencies (Chart 9). 
   
The  EMEs’  experience,  in  general,  in  the  1990s  has  highlighted  the  growing  importance  of  capital 
flows in determining the exchange rate movements as against trade flows and economic growth in the 
1980s and before. In the case of most developing countries, which specialise in labour-intensive and 
low and intermediate technology products, profit margins in the highly competitive markets are very 
thin and vulnerable to pricing power by large retail chains. Consequently, exchange rate volatility has 
significant employment, output and distributional consequences. Foreign exchange market conditions 
have remained orderly in the post-1993 period, barring occasional periods of volatility (Chart 10). The 
Indian approach to exchange rate management has been to avoid excessive volatility. Intervention by 
the Reserve Bank in the foreign exchange market, however, has been relatively small compared to 
total turnover in the market.  
BIS Review 51/2007 
 11
 The  exchange  rate  policy  in  recent  years  has  been  guided  by  the  broad  principles  of  careful 
monitoring  and  management  of  exchange  rates  with  flexibility,  without  a  fixed  target  or  a  pre-
announced target or a band, coupled with the ability to intervene, if and when necessary. The overall 
approach to the management of India's foreign exchange reserves takes into account the changing 
composition of the balance of payments and endeavours to reflect the “liquidity risks” associated with 
different  types  of  flows  and  other  requirements.  Illustratively,  the  Indian  rupee  exhibited  two-way 
movements  during  2006-07  moving  in  a  range  of  Rs.43.14-46.97  per  US  dollar.  The  rupee  initially 
depreciated  against  the  US  dollar  during  the  year,  reaching  Rs.46.97  on  July  19,  2006,  reflecting 
higher  crude  oil  prices,  FII  outflows  and  geo-political  risks  in  the  Middle  East  region.  The  rupee, 
however, strengthened thereafter on the back of moderation in crude oil prices, revival of FII inflows 
and weakness of the US dollar in the international markets. The rupee appreciated further to reach Rs. 
40.59  per  US  dollar  on  May  7,  2007  due  to  increased  supply  of  dollars  in  the  market.  Thereafter, 
however, the rupee depreciated to Rs. 40.85 per US dollar on May 16, 2007. At this level, the rupee 
appreciated by 6.7 per cent over end-March 2007 and 9.2 per cent over end-March 2006. Against the 
Euro, the rupee appreciated by 4.7 per cent over end-March 2007, but depreciated by 2.4 per cent 
over  end-March  2006.  The  real  effective  exchange  rate  (REER)  of  the  Indian  rupee  (six-currency 
trade-based weights) at 112.2 as on April 18, 2007 appreciated by 12.2 per cent over the base 1993-
94; over 2000-01 the appreciation is by 9.6 per cent (Chart 11). 
  
Apart  from  the  spot  segment,  the  foreign  exchange  market  in  India  trades  in  derivatives  such  as 
forwards,  swaps,  and  options.  The  typical  forward  contract  is  for  one  month,  three  months,  or  six 
months, with three months being the most common. Forward contracts for longer periods are not as 
 12 
 BIS Review 51/2007
common  because  of  the  great  uncertainties  involved.  A  swap  transaction  in  the  foreign  exchange 
market is a combination of a spot and a forward in the opposite direction. Foreign exchange swaps 
account for the largest share of the total derivatives turnover in India, followed by forwards and options 
(Table  5).  Options  have  remained  insignificant  despite  being  in  existence  for  three  years.  With 
restrictions  on  the  issue  of  foreign  exchange  swaps  and  options  by  corporates  in  India,  turnover  in 
these segments (swap and options) essentially reflects inter-bank transactions.

Note: Options denote foreign currency Indian rupee options. Turnover is calculated by taking the difference between notional 
outstanding over the previous year. 
With greater opening of the capital account, the forward premia is getting gradually aligned with the 
interest rate differential reflecting growing market efficiency. In the post-liberalisation phase, forward 
premia of the Indian rupee vis-à-vis dollar has generally remained high indicating that rupee was at a 
discount  to  the  US  dollar.  In  recent  times,  however,  reflecting  the  build-up  of  foreign  exchange 
reserves,  the  strong  capital  flows  and  the  confidence  in  the  Indian  economy,  forward  premia  have 
come down sharply from the peak reached in 1995-96 (Chart 12).  
 As  a  result  of  various  measures,  the  Indian  foreign  exchange  market  has  evolved  into  a  relatively 
mature market over a period of time with increase in depth and liquidity. The turnover in the market 
has increased over the years. With the gradual opening up of the capital account, the forward premia 
are getting increasingly aligned with the interest rate differential. There is also evidence of enhanced 
efficiency in the foreign exchange market as is reflected in low bid-ask spreads.  
The  gradual  development  of  the  foreign  exchange  market  has  helped  in  smooth  implementation  of 
current  account  convertibility  and  the  phased  and  gradual  opening  of  the  capital  account.  The 
availability  of  derivatives  is  also  helping  domestic  entities  and  foreign  investors  in  their  risk

management. This approach has helped India in being able to maintain financial stability right through 
the  period  of  economic  reforms  and  liberalisation  leading  to  continuing  opening  of  the  economy, 
despite a great degree of volatility in international markets, particularly during the 1990s.  
Financial market integration 
The  success  of  a  monetary  policy  transmission  framework,  which  relies  on  indirect  instruments  of 
monetary  management  such  as  interest  rates,  is  contingent  upon  the  extent  and  speed  with  which 
changes in the central bank’s policy rate are transmitted to the spectrum of market interest rates and 
exchange rate in the economy and onwards to the real sector. Changes in the central banks’ policy 
rates  can,  through  variations  in  domestic  money  market  interest  rates,  impact  the  exchange  rates, 
which,  in  turn,  impact  the  real  economy.  Similarly,  movement  in  policy  interest  rates  can  influence 
other asset markets such as equity and property prices, further strengthening monetary transmission. 
If  markets  are  weakly  integrated,  the  central  bank’s  interest  rate  signals  will  not  have  the  desired 
impact on other short and long-term interest rates, the exchange rate and other asset prices. In such a 
scenario, the central bank would need to act in various segments of the market to achieve the desired 
objectives. In brief, the greater the degree of integration across market segments, the stronger is the 
transmission of monetary policy to the spectrum of financial markets and on to the real economy. By 
enabling  dispersion  of  shocks  and  risks  to  a  particular  segment  across  all  markets,  well-integrated 
markets also contribute to financial stability.  
Financial  market  reforms  in  India  have  enabled  a  greater  integration  of  various  segments  of  the 
financial  market,  reducing  arbitrage  opportunities,  achieving  higher  level  of  efficiency  in  market 
operation  of  intermediaries  and  increasing  efficacy  of  monetary  policy  in  the  economy.  Growing 
integration of financial markets beginning 2000 could be gauged from cross correlation among various 
market  interest  rates.  The  correlation  structure  of  interest  rates  reveals  several  notable  features  of 
integration of specific market segments (Table 6).

First, in the money market segment, there is evidence of stronger correlation among interest rates in 
the  more  recent  period  2000-06  than  the  earlier  period  1993-2000,  suggesting  the  impact  of  policy 
initiatives  undertaken  for  financial  deepening.  The  enhanced  correlation  among  interest  rates  also 
indicates  improvement  in  efficiency  in  the  operations  of  financial  intermediaries  trading  in  different 
instruments. Second, the high correlation between risk free and liquid instruments such as Treasury 
Bills,  which  serve  as  benchmark  instruments,  and  other  market  instruments  such  as  certificates  of 
deposit (CDs) and commercial papers (CPs) and forward exchange premia, underlines the efficiency 
of the price discovery process. Third, the sharp improvement in correlation between the reverse repo 
rate and money market rates in the recent period implies enhanced effectiveness of monetary policy 
transmission.  Fourth,  the  high  degree  of  correlation  between  long-term  government  bond  yield  and 
short-term Treasury Bills rate indicates the significance of term-structure of interest rates in financial 
markets.  Fifth,  the  correlation  between  interest  rates  in  money  markets  and  three-month  forward 
premia was significantly high, indicating relatively high horizontal integration. Integration of the foreign 
exchange market with the money market and the government securities market has facilitated closer 
co-ordination of monetary and external sector management. The impact of foreign exchange market 
intervention  can  be  carefully  coordinated  with  monetary  management  encompassing  constant 
monitoring of the supply of banking system liquidity and an active use of open market operations to 
adjust liquidity conditions. Sixth, the equity market appears to be segmented with relatively low and 
negative correlation with money market segments. 
A  growing  integration  between  the  money,  the  gilt  and  the  foreign  exchange market segments was 
also discernible in the convergence of financial prices, within and among various segments and co-
movement in interest rates (Chart 13).  
BIS Review 51/2007 
 15
   
The degree of integration of the foreign exchange market with other markets is largely determined by 
the  degree  of  openness.  One  of  the  indicators  of  foreign  market  integration  is  the  differential  in 
covered  interest  rates.  In  the  Indian  context,  the  forward  price  of  the  rupee  is  not  essentially 
determined  by  the  interest  rate  differentials,  but  it  is  also significantly  influenced  by:  (a) supply  and 
demand of forward US dollars; (b) interest differentials and expectations of future interest rates; and 
(c) expectations of future US dollar-rupee exchange rate. Empirical evidence supports this view, as the 
three  month  forward  premia  (FP3)  has  less  than  perfect  co-movement  with  interest  rate  differential 
(between 91-day treasury bill rate and three-month LIBOR), indicative of the time varying nature of the 
risk premium. The inter-linkage becomes stronger when the interest rate differential is based on the 
monthly  average  call  money  rate  and  one-month  LIBOR  (Chart  14).  The  relationship  improves  still 
further,  when  the  difference  between  the  commercial  paper  (CP)  rate  in  India  and  the  3-month  US 
dollar LIBOR rate is considered for interest parity assessments. The deviation of the forward premia 
from the interest parity condition appears to increase during volatile conditions in the spot segment of 
the foreign exchange market. 
  
From the monetary policy perspective, there has been convergence among market segments, with a 
significant  decline  in  the  spread  of  market  interest  rates  over  the  reverse  repo  rate  (Table  7).  The 
spread  was  the  lowest  for  the  inter-bank  call  money  rate  followed  by  rates  on  Treasury  Bills, 
certificates of deposit, commercial paper and 10-year government bond yield. The benefit of financial 
market  development  percolating  to  the  real  sector  is  also  evident  from  the  moderation  in spread of 
commercial paper over the policy rate. The narrowing of the spread between the policy rate and other 
market rates suggests the increasing efficiency of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.

Thus, integration among various market segments has grown, especially in the recent period. This is 
reflected  in  an  increase  in  the  depth  of  the  markets  and  higher  correlation  among  interest  rates  in 
various  market  segments.  Growing  integration  among  various  financial  market  segments  was 
accompanied by lower volatility of interest rates. The narrowing of the interest rate spread over the 
reverse repo rate reflects an improvement in the monetary policy transmission channel and greater 
financial market integration. We can also note the gradual increase in depth of all financial markets in 
India over the years, including in the equity market, though the average daily transaction volumes are 
the highest in the forex and money markets (Table 8).

securities  and  the  foreign  exchange  markets  in  view  of  their  critical  role  in  overall  growth  and 
development of the economy and particularly in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The 
approach has been one of simultaneous movement on several fronts, graduated and calibrated, with 
an  emphasis  on 
in  market 
microstructure.  The  pace  of  reforms  was  contingent  upon  putting  in  place  appropriate  systems  and 
procedures, technologies and market practices. Initiatives taken by the Reserve Bank have brought 
about a significant transformation of various segments of the financial market. These developments, 
by  improving  the  depth  and  liquidity  in  domestic  financial  markets,  have  contributed  to  better  price 
discovery  of  interest  rates  and  exchange  rates,  which,  in  turn,  have  led  to  greater  efficiency  in 
resource allocation in the economy. The increase in size and depth of financial markets has paved the 
way  for  flexible  use  of  indirect  instruments.  Greater  depth  and  liquidity  and  freedom  to  market 
participants  have  also  strengthened  the  integration  of  various  segments  of  the  financial  market. 
Increased integration not only leads to more efficient dispersal of risks across the spectrum but also 
increases  the  efficacy  of  monetary  policy  impulses.  Evidence  suggests  that  growing  integration  of 
various financial market segments in India has been accompanied by lower volatility of interest rates. 
While financial markets have certainly become more developed over the years, we are quite conscious 
of the fact that development of financial markets is an ongoing process and there is still some way to 
go before the markets are fully developed and integrated. Initiatives to further deepen and widen the 
various segments of the financial market will, therefore, need to be pursued in the months and years 
ahead. Financial markets will have to play an even more important role in future to sustain the current 
growth  momentum  being  experienced  by  the  Indian  economy  but  their  development  will  need  to 
continue  to  be  in  step  with  corresponding  real  sector  developments.  Further  development  and 
integration  of  various  segments  is  also  important  in  the  context  of  envisaged  move  towards  fuller 
capital  account  convertibility.  Accordingly,  in  the  Annual  Policy  Statement  for  the  year  2007-08 
released  on  April  24,  2007,  several  measures  are  being  initiated  to  further  develop  the  financial 
markets. 
A  number  of  initiatives  have  been  announced  for  further  development  of  the  government  securities 
market. With a view to helping investors to plan their investments in advance and, in turn, to avoid 
undue  liquidity  pressure  in  the  system,  the  operational  modalities  for  introduction  of  an  indicative 
calendar for state government borrowing are being finalised. A “Non-Competitive Bidding Scheme” in 
the auctions of State Development loans (SDLs) would be introduced in the financial year 2007-08. 
The modalities for operationalisation of the scheme are being finalised. Reissuance of SDLs has been 
favoured  with  a  view  to  building  up  a  critical  mass  and  thereby  improving  the  secondary  market 
liquidity  of  such  securities.  The  Reserve  Bank  is  in  consultation  with  the  State  Governments  to 
introduce a system of reissuances. 
With a view to simplifying the methodology for pricing of floating rate bonds (FRBs) in the secondary 
market, it is proposed to use the average cut-off yield on 182-day Treasury Bills, instead of the yield 
on 364-day Treasury Bills as a benchmark rate for the FRBs to be issued in future. The modalities for 
undertaking  active  consolidation  of  Central  Government  securities  have  already  been  finalised  in 
consultation with the Government of India. 
As the economy develops and financial markets become more sophisticated, market participants need 
better access to risk management mechanisms. Thus, interest rate derivatives need to be developed 
further.  Accordingly,  the  Reserve  Bank  has  recently  issued  comprehensive  guidelines  in  respect  of 
interest  rate  derivatives,  incorporating  the  broad  regulatory  framework  for  undertaking  derivative 
transactions.  In  respect  of  OTC  derivative  transactions,  it  has  become  necessary  to  have  a 
mechanism for transparent capture and dissemination of trade information as well as an efficient post-
trade  processing  infrastructure  to  address  some  of  the  attendant  risks.  To  begin  with,  the  CCIL  is 
being advised to start a trade reporting platform for Rupee Interest Rate Swaps (IRS). This reporting 
module  would  be  functional  by  August  31,  2007  and  will  thereafter  be  available  to  all  market 
participants. 
An anonymous order driven system for trading in Interest Rate Derivatives (IRDs) was introduced on 
exchanges in 2003. Banks were allowed to hedge the risk in their underlying investment portfolio while 
Primary Dealers (PDs) were also permitted as market-makers. Since then, the Government securities 
market has undergone numerous developmental changes, including the introduction of short selling 
and  when-issued  markets.  Recognising  the  need  for  a  robust  interest  rate  futures  market  as  an 
18 
 BIS Review 51/2007
effective instrument for management of interest rate risk, a Working Group is being set up to go into all 
the relevant issues and to suggest measures to facilitate the development of the interest rate futures 
market. 
As the capital account is gradually opened further the Reserve Bank has taken several initiatives to 
provide  a  more  conducive  environment  for  the  conduct  of  foreign  exchange  business.  The  prime 
concern has been to provide prompt and efficient customer service by progressively liberalising foreign 
exchange  related  transactions,  removing  restrictions  and  simplifying  procedures.  Concomitantly, 
powers have been delegated to authorised dealers with a view to improving ease of transactions for 
the  common  person.  Keeping  in  view  the  recommendations  of  the  Committee  on  Fuller  Capital 
Account  Convertibility  (CFCAC),  several  measures  have  been  proposed  in  the  Annual  Policy 
Statement towards liberalisation of foreign exchange facilities.  
In order to provide greater flexibility to Indian companies for investments abroad and to rationalise the 
existing  facilities,  it  is  proposed  (a)  to  enhance  the  overseas  investment  limit  (total  financial 
commitments) for Indian companies from the existing limit of 200 per cent of their net worth to 300 per 
cent  of  their  net  worth,  as  per  the  last  audited  balance  sheet;  and  (b)  to  reckon  the  amount  of 
guarantee at 100 per cent of the amount instead of the current conversion factor of 50 per cent for 
determining the total financial commitments. 
At  present,  listed  Indian  companies  have  a  separate  limit  of  25  per  cent  of  net  worth  for  portfolio 
investment abroad in listed overseas companies. It has been decided to enhance this limit to 35 per 
cent of net worth. At present, the aggregate ceiling on overseas investment by mutual funds is US $ 3 
billion.  With  a  view  to  providing  greater  opportunity  to  mutual  funds  for  investment  overseas,  it  is 
proposed to increase the ceiling to US $ 4 billion. 
In order to further liberalise the remittance scheme for inpiduals, the present limit of US$ 50,000 is 
being  enhanced  to  US$  100,000  per  financial  year  for  any  permitted  current  or  capital  account 
transaction or a combination of both. 
The basic principle for accessing domestic foreign exchange markets is hedging of underlying foreign 
exchange exposures. In keeping with the evolution of the foreign exchange market and the increase in 
depth  and  volumes,  a  range  of  hedging  instruments  have  been  permitted  to  market  participants 
including  foreign  exchange  forwards,  swaps  and  options,  but  mainly  against  crystallised  foreign 
currency exposures. However, it has now been decided to expand the range of hedging tools available 
to  the  market  participants as  also  to  facilitate  dynamic  hedging by  the  residents  in respect  of  other 
economic  exposures.  This  will  include  hedging  of  price  risk  faced  by  domestic  producers  of  non-
ferrous metals, users of aviation turbine fuel, and others facing similar systemic international price risk. 
In  order  to  facilitate  dynamic  hedging  of  foreign  exchange  exposures  of  exporters  and  importers  of 
goods and services, it is proposed to enhance this limit to 75 per cent from 50 per cent earlier. 
Similarly, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are being permitted to hedge their foreign exchange 
exposures.  They  will  be  allowed  to  book  forward  contracts  without  underlying  exposures  or  past 
records of exports and imports. Furthermore, resident inpiduals are being enabled to manage/hedge 
their  foreign  exchange  exposures,  including  anticipated  exposures  up  to  an  annual  limit  of  US  $ 
100,000, which can be freely cancelled and rebooked. 
In view of the increasing exposure of Indian entities to foreign currency risk, it has also been decided 
to set up a Working Group on Currency Futures to study the international experience and suggest a 
suitable  framework  to  operationalise  the  proposal,  in  line  with  the  current  legal  and  regulatory 
framework. 
These  initiatives  can  be  seen  within  the  overall  context  of  the  financial  sector  development  in  the 
country,  particularly,  in  the  money  market,  government  securities  market  and  the  foreign  exchange 
market.  As  we  gain  experience,  with  the  implementation  of  these  initiatives,  we  can  expect  a 
continuing process of financial market development that aids the overall development process. Similar 
efforts  are  being  undertaken  by  the  Government  and  the  securities  regulator,  the  Securities  and 
Exchange Board of India along with the Reserve Bank in activating the corporate debt market. As has 
been  experienced  elsewhere,  among  the  various  financial  markets,  the  corporate  debt  market  is 
indeed the most difficult to develop for a variety of reasons. Our experience with development of the 
government securities market suggests that a great deal of detailed work will need to be undertaken 
over  a  period  of  time  to  put  in  place  an  appropriate  market  micro  infrastructure,  trading  platforms, 
technology and clearing and settlement systems, along with further development of both issuers and 
buyers.  The  expansion  of  the  pension  fund  and  insurance  industries  will  progressively  result  in  the 
BIS Review 51/2007 
 19
presence  of  a  larger  financial  investor  base,  which  will  help  in  the  overall  expansion  of  financial 
markets and in particular the corporate debt market.  
Annex I: Money market instruments for liquidity management 
The Reserve Bank has been making efforts to develop a repo market outside the LAF for bank and 
nonbank  participants,  so  as  to  provide  a  stable  collateralised  funding  alternative  with  a  view  to 
promoting smooth transformation of the call/notice money market into a pure inter-bank market and for 
deepening  the  underlying  Government  securities  market.  Thus,  the  following  new  instruments  have 
been introduced. 
Collateralised Borrowing and Lending Obligation (CBLO) 
• 
Developed by the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) and introduced on January 
20, 2003, it is a discounted instrument available in electronic book entry form for the maturity 
period ranging from one day to ninety days (can be made available up to one year as per 
RBI guidelines).  
In  order  to  enable  the  market  participants  to  borrow  and  lend  funds,  CCIL  provides  the 
Dealing  System  through  Indian  Financial  Network  (INFINET),  a  closed  user  group  to  the 
Members of the Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) who maintain Current account with RBI 
and through Internet for other entities who do not maintain Current account with RBI.  
Membership  (including  Associate  Membership)  of  CBLO  segment  is  extended  to  banks, 
financial  institutions,  insurance  companies,  mutual  funds,  primary  dealers,  NBFCs,  non-
Government Provident Funds, Corporates, etc.  
Eligible securities are Central Government securities including Treasury Bills.  
Borrowing limits for members is fixed by CCIL at the beginning of the day taking into account 
the securities deposited by borrowers in their CSGL account with CCIL. The securities are 
subjected to necessary hair-cut after marking them to market.  
Auction market is available only to NDS Members for overnight borrowing and settlement on 
T+0 basis. At the end of the Auction market session, CCIL initiates auction matching process 
based on Uniform Yield principle.  
CCIL  assumes  the  role  of  the  central  counter  party  through  the  process  of  novation  and 
guarantees settlement of transactions in CBLO.  
Automated value-free transfer of securities between market participants and the CCIL was 
introduced during 2004-05.  
Members can reckon unencumbered securities for SLR calculations.  
The operations in CBLO are exempted from cash reserve requirement (CRR). 
Market repo 
• 
To broaden the repo market, the Reserve Bank enabled non-banking financial companies, 
mutual  funds,  housing  finance  companies  and  insurance  companies  not  holding  SGL 
accounts to undertake repo transactions with effect from March 3, 2003. These entities were 
permitted  to  access  the  repo  market  through  their  “gilt  accounts”  maintained  with  the 
custodians.  
Subsequently,  non-scheduled  urban  co-operative  banks  and  listed  companies  with  gilt 
accounts with scheduled commercial banks were allowed to participate.  
Necessary precautions were built into the system to ensure “delivery versus payment” (DvP) 
and transparency, while restricting the repos to Government securities only.  
Rollover of repo transactions in Government securities was facilitated with the enabling of 
DvP III mode of settlement in Government securities which involves settlement of securities 
          20 
 BIS Review 51/2007
and funds on a net basis, effective April 2, 2004. This provided significant flexibility to market 
participants in managing their collateral. 
Some assessments 
• 
CBLO  and  market  repo  helped  in  aligning  short-term  money  market  rates  to  the  LAF 
corridor.  
Mutual funds and insurance companies are generally the main supplier of funds while banks, 
primary dealers and corporates are the major borrowers in the repo market outside the LAF.
