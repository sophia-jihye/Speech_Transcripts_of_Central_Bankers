Svante Öberg: The Riksbank's forecasting performance 
Speech  by  Mr  Svante  Öberg,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  Stockholm 
University, Stockholm, 26 November 2007.  
 Introduction 
”When one remembers how foolishly one thought and how wrong one was and how different 
things have usually been and how the world has been affected by strange metamorphoses, 
one has less and less respect every year for forecasts.” This is a fairly well-used quotation 
from Alf Henriksson. And they are wise words. But at the Riksbank we have no choice, as 
the  interest  rate  affects  inflation  and  the  rest  of  the  economy  with  some  time  lag.  Our 
decisions  must  therefore  be  based  on  forecasts.  The  question  I  wish  to  discuss  today 
concerns our forecasting performance.  
Evaluation is important for independent central banks 
Experiences show that the work on maintaining low and stable inflation is made easier if the 
central  bank  can  act  independently.  At  the  same  time,  greater  independence  makes 
demands  on  the  central  bank  to  be  open  and  to  clearly  explain  its  decisions.  There  are 
several reasons why this is important.  
One  important  aspect  is  that  openness  makes  it  easier  to  evaluate  and  to  require 
accountability,  which  is  essential  for  a  central  bank’s  legitimacy.  Openness  enables  the 
general public to understand what the central bank is doing. This in turn makes demands on 
the central bank to be clear in its analysis and message. While the openness makes it easier 
to evaluate monetary policy, one can say that the evaluations are also an important part of 
the openness.  
Only  a  couple  of  decades  ago  central  banks  were  fairly  secretive.  Very  little  of  what  was 
carried  out  became  known  to  the  general  public.  There  have  been  considerable  changes 
since then. The process of development from uncommunicativeness to increasing openness 
that  has  taken  place  at  central  banks  around  the  world  has  probably  contributed  to  the 
success  of  monetary  policy.  What  I  mean  here  is  that  they  have  succeeded  in  anchoring 
inflation expectations at a low and stable level.  
The Riksbank is one of the most open central banks of all. We began publishing our inflation 
forecasts  in  1997  and  since  then  we  have  gradually  become  more  open  in  our  view  of 
economic  developments.  Other  central  banks  are  also  moving  towards  greater  openness. 
For instance, only a few days ago the Federal Reserve in the United States began publishing 
forecasts four times a year instead of twice. They have also extended the forecast horizon 
from two to three years, just as we at the Riksbank did a couple of years ago. 
It is thus essential that monetary policy is evaluated and discussed. This applies both to the 
principles behind monetary policy and to how well we succeed in meeting our objective. To 
make  this  possible  there  must  be  a  clear  basis  for  the  decision.  It  must  be  clearly  shown 
which principles we have based our monetary policy decisions on and what information our 
conclusions are based on.  
As monetary policy affects the economy with some time lag, the monetary policy decisions 
must  be  based  on  forecasts,  as  I  mentioned  at  the  start.  Good  bases  for  decisions  in  the 
form of accurate forecasts are thus an important factor in the success of monetary policy. But 
future developments in inflation and other variables are uncertain. For one thing, there is the 
uncertainty linked to the statistical methods and models, as certain fundamental parameters 
vary over time. For another thing, there are a number of other factors that can affect inflation

in a way that is very difficult to predict. For instance, increased geopolitical unease can push 
up the oil prices, or an unexpected outbreak of a disease among animals can lead to a rapid 
rise in food prices. 
When central banks make forecasts, it is therefore increasingly common that they put a band 
around the forecasts that measures their uncertainty. These bands help provide information 
about the uncertainty in the forecasts and also make it easier to communicate the monetary 
policy alternatives that may arise in the future. 
But what do we know about the forecasting performance of the Riksbank?  
Forecasting performance is evaluated both internally and externally 
Forecasting performance can be evaluated in many different ways. There are a number of 
statistical methods that can be used to analyse how accurate the forecasts are. One means 
of measuring accuracy is to compare the forecasts with outcomes. The problem is that one 
doesn’t know whether a forecasting error is due to the forecasting method being inadequate, 
or to something genuinely unpredictable. It is therefore common to compare accuracy with 
forecasts from simple time series models to gain a perspective on whether the forecasting 
errors are unusually large or small.  
We have made a number of evaluations of our own forecasting performance and we have 
also been evaluated by external experts. In recent years, we ourselves evaluated some of 
the models used in the forecasting work. Various types of model are used in the forecasting 
work  to  produce  the  best  possible  base  for  an  assessment  of  economic  developments.  A 
study  that  will  soon  be  published has  investigated  the  forecasting  precision of  our  general 
equilibrium model and the Bayesian VAR model.1 Another study has evaluated our indicator 
models.2  
In addition we publish information to enable an assessment of the monetary policy conducted 
over  the  past  2-3  years  in  a  special  appendix  to  the  first  Monetary  Policy  Report  of  every 
year.  It  contains,  for  instance,  comparisons  of  our  forecasts  with  other  forecasts  and  with 
outcomes. The material we produce in our annual evaluations forms an important basis for 
the Riksdag Committee on Finance’s report on monetary policy.  
Every  year  the  Committee  evaluates  at  its  own  initiative  the  monetary  policy  conducted 
during  the  previous  years.  They  have  done  so  since  1999  when  the  Riksbank  became 
independent.  Last  year  we  also  had  two  external  researchers,  Francesco  Giavazzi  and 
Frederic  Mishkin,  who  made  a  more  in-depth  evaluation  of  monetary  policy.  This  was 
commissioned  by  the  Committee  on  Finance  and  covered  the  entire  ten-year  period  of 
inflation targeting.  
New study of the Riksbank’s forecasting performance 
As a step in the evaluation work, three economists at the Monetary Policy Department of the 
Riksbank recently made a comprehensive analysis of our forecasting performance during the

period  2000-2006.3  They  have  analysed  the  forecasts  of  the  most  important  variables  for 
monetary policy – GDP, employment, productivity and inflation.4  
In the study they have tried to estimate how accurate the forecasts have been on average by 
comparing them with outcomes. To gain a perspective of the accuracy, our forecasts have 
also  been  compared  with  forecasts  from  a  simple  time  series  model.  The  so-called  AR 
models,  which  are  often  used  as  a  standard  comparison  in  evaluations  of  this  type,  quite 
simply function so that one adjusts the variable in question with the aid of its own historical 
data.  The  type  of  time  series  model  chosen  for  the  comparison  is,  despite  its  simplicity, 
difficult to surpass, according to several international studies.  
Moreover, they have analysed how far ahead we can make forecasts with good accuracy, 
that is to say what forecasting memory the different variables have.5 They have also looked 
at  whether  there  are  tendencies  to  systematically  over-estimate  or  under-estimate  the 
different variables, that is, whether the forecasts have any bias.  
What does the analysis show about our forecasting performance? 
Let us first look at the entire period and compare our forecasts for GDP, employment and 
CPIX  with  outcomes.  CPIX  is  a  measure  of  underlying  inflation,  which  until  recently  was 
known as UND1X. Hardly surprisingly, it appears that the forecasts have varied in accuracy 
(Figure 1). For instance, we have under-estimated employment growth recently (Figure 2). 
Nor did we predict the sharp rise in inflation spring 2001 in our assessments the previous 
year. However, we were more successful in capturing the downswing in inflation during 2003 
(Figure 3). But how do things look in more detail for the different variables? 
Forecasts for GDP growth 
With  regard  to  the  GDP  forecasts,  we  have  periodically  been  accurate  and  close  to  the 
outcome,  while  we  have  fallen  short  on  other  occasions  (Figure  1).  It  is  often  particularly 
difficult to make forecasts in an economic turnaround. 
Compared with the time series model that is used to gain a perspective of the forecasting 
memory, we make better GDP forecasts up to a year ahead. With regard to the forecasting 
memory  for  GDP,  that  is,  how  far  ahead  we  can  make  a  forecast  with  some  information 
value, this stretches four quarters ahead (Figure 5). This agrees with experiences in other 
countries. One result of an evaluation that analysed the forecasting memory of Canadian and 
US macro variables shows that it is often limited to the first forecasting year.6  
Another means of analysing the forecasting performance is to look at the correlation between 
forecast  and  outcome  (Figure  9).  The  correlation  shows  the  strength  in  the  relationship 
between forecasts and outcomes. A correlation of one year is a perfect relationship, if it is 
zero there is no relationship at all, while minus one is a perfect negative relationship. The 
correlations shall thus preferably be positive and as close to one as possible.  
One year ahead the correlation between the GDP forecast and outcome is just over 0.6 and 
two years ahead it is around 0.1. This supports the picture we obtained when we compared

Sveriges Riksbank Economic Review (2007:3), Sveriges Riksbank. 
4   The forecasts for employment and productivity have been evaluated during the period 2002-2006 as there are 
no quarterly forecasts documented further back in time for these variables. 
5   The forecasting memory is defined as the longest horizon where the forecast error variation (measured as the 
root mean square error) is lower than the series’ variation (standard deviation).

important macroeconomic time series”, Department of Economics Working Paper 13 (2006), McGill University.

out forecasting memory with the time series models. We were better than the model up to 
one year ahead and we had a forecasting memory four quarters ahead.  
Forecasts for employment 
If we instead look at employment forecasts, we believed that employment would rise more in 
2003  and  2004  than  it  actually  did  (Figure  2).  Instead,  productivity  growth  was  repeatedly 
stronger  than  expected.  But  on  the  other  hand,  employment  has  been  stronger  than 
expected  in  our  assessments  over  the  past  year.  The  forecasts  we  have  made  for 
employment growth are on the whole more accurate than those of the time series model and 
the forecasting memory stretches eight quarters ahead (Figure 6).  
If, on the other hand, we only look at developments over the past two years, the Riksbank 
has  succeeded  in  forecasting  employment  about  as  well  as  the  time  series  model.  This 
means  that  we  have  not  succeeded  in  adding  any  further  information  on  top  of  what  the 
simple model can capture.  
How  is  the  relationship  between  employment  forecasts  and  outcome?  The  correlation  is 
almost 0.9 one year ahead and just over 0.4 two years ahead (see Figure 9). The correlation 
is stronger than for GDP and agrees with the picture we obtained when we compared the 
forecasts with the time series model. The employment forecasts appear on average to have 
been more accurate than the GDP forecasts. 
Forecasts for productivity 
Productivity is a central variable in the monetary policy analysis. The most common measure 
of productivity is labour productivity, that is, the ratio between GDP and the number of hours 
worked.  It  has  not  been  possible  to  evaluate  this  measure  here,  as  there  is  not  enough 
historical forecasting data on the number of hours worked. Instead the ratio between GDP 
and employment has been used as an approximation.  
The  analysis  shows  that  our  forecasts  have  under-estimated  productivity  growth  on  all 
forecasting  horizons  (Figure  4).7  The  time  series  model  is  on  the  whole  slightly  more 
accurate  than  our  forecasts  have  been  during  this  period.  The  forecasting  memory  for 
productivity  has  only  extended  one  quarter  ahead  (Figure  7).  The  same  applies  to  the 
correlation between forecasts and outcomes. It is 0.7 one quarter ahead, while it is zero both 
one and two years ahead (see Figure 9).  
Inflation forecasts  
When it comes to inflation measured as the annual rate of increase in the CPIX, we have 
made fairly accurate forecasts during a large part of the period evaluated, that is, 2000-2006 
(Figure 3). Something we missed was the sharp upturn in inflation in spring 2001. This was 
primarily due to an outbreak of mad cow disease which led to rising food prices. But since 
then we have made inflation forecasts that have been close to the outcomes. For instance, 
the downswing in inflation in 2003 was captured to a greater extent than the upswing at the 
beginning  of  2001.  The  inflation  forecasts  are  on  the  whole  more  accurate  than  the  time 
series models. The forecasting memory for the CPIX extends eight quarters ahead (Figure 
8).  
The correlation between forecasts and outcome is almost 0.8 one year ahead and just over 
0.5 two years ahead (see Figure 9). None of the other variables has as high a correlation two 
                                                 
7   We  have  earlier  analysed  this  in  the  context  of  a  structural  model,  Ramses.  The  evaluation  appendix  to 
Inflation Monetary Policy Report 2007:1 contains an analysis of, for instance, the effects of productivity shocks 
on the economy.

years ahead. The fact that the correlation wanes in time is natural as the uncertainty in the 
forecasts increases.  
Is there any bias one or two years ahead in the forecasts? 
Let us now look at whether there is any bias, that is, systematic over-estimation or under-
estimation in the forecasts one and two years ahead. The smaller the bias a forecast has, the 
better it is.  
One year ahead the bias for annual GDP growth is very small. However, two years ahead 
the  forecasts  have  been  almost  been  four  tenths  too  high  on  average,  compared  with  the 
outcomes, which is not negligible (Figure 10).  
With  regard  to  the  annual  development  in  employment,  the  bias  is  just  under  three  tenths 
one year ahead and two tenths two years ahead. Employment has been under-estimated in 
both cases, that is, the outcomes have on average been higher than in the forecasts.  
Productivity has also been under-estimated both one and two years ahead. Productivity has 
a bias of around one tenth one year ahead and just under seven tenths two years ahead. We 
have thus made a relatively large under-estimation of productivity growth two years ahead.8  
With regard to the annual change in inflation measured as the CPIX, the forecasts have on 
average been almost three tenths lower than the outcomes one year ahead. However, the 
forecasts  two  years  ahead  have  on  average  been  two  tenths  higher  than  the  outcomes, 
which can be regarded as a minor deviation.  
What  conclusions  can  we  draw  from  this?  The  bias  is  relatively  small  for  most  of  the 
variables.  There  are  no  clear  signs  of  any  systematic  errors  in  the  forecasts,  with  the 
possible  exception  of  productivity.  The  rate  of 
in  productivity  has  been 
systematically under-estimated during the period. However, it should be added that none of 
the variables has any statistically significant bias.

Comparison with other forecasters  
The study has also compared the Riksbank’s forecasting errors with the National Institute of 
Economic Research (NIER) and Consensus Forecasts panel, a compilation of forecasts from 
a number of different forecasters. It is clear from the study that the Riksbank’s forecasts for 
GDP growth have been among the best compared with other participants in the Consensus 
panel (Figure 11). On around half of the occasions we have made more accurate forecasts 
than 80 per cent of the other forecasters. The inflation forecasts measured as the annual rate 
of change in the CPI have in almost 75 per cent of cases been more accurate than half of the 
forecasters  in  Consensus  panel  (Figure  12).  In  a  comparison  of  quarterly  GDP  and  CPIX 
forecasts,  it  is  shown  that  the  Riksbank  has  on  the  whole  made  slightly  more  accurate 
forecasts  than  the  NIER.  At  the  same  time,  it  should  be  said  that  the  differences  in 
forecasting performance are not statistically significant. 
If we compare the results with an earlier forecast evaluation made by the Riksbank, there are 
some similarities. In this evaluation we found, for instance, that the NIER has made better 
forecasts of productivity than we have, at the same time as we have made better forecasts of 
CPIX inflation.9  
                                                 
8   During the evaluation period for productivity, which extends from 2002 to 2006, we have under-estimated both 
GDP  and  employment  in  our  forecasts.  Please  note  that  the  bias  estimate  for  GDP  changes  character 
depending on whether the sample refers to 2000-2006 or 2002-2006. 
9   This  result  from  an  earlier  forecast  evaluation  applies  only  to  forecasts  for  the  next  year.  The  result  is 
statistically reliable.

There  are  of  course  a  number  of  difficulties  in  making  correct  comparisons  of  this  nature, 
which is also indicated in the study. It is important to note that the Riksbank made forecasts 
under the assumption of an unchanged repo rate up to the publication of the second Inflation 
Report of 2005. With this method CPI inflation should actually be over-estimated in the short-
term  if  the  interest  rate  is  cut.  It  is  actually  only  with  effect  from  this  year,  when  we  have 
begun to make forecasts based on our own interest rate path, that the forecasts fully mirror 
our views of the future. 
Another point is that the forecasts are rarely made at the same point in time, which can of 
course make accuracy more difficult. However, the analysis here is designed to ensure this 
problem is as small as possible.  
Forecasts are uncertain and we mark this by an uncertainty band 
Forecasts are uncertain and one is not always right. Most of those who make forecasts are 
very  well  aware  of  this.  Back  in  1997  when  we  began  publishing  forecasts  of  inflation  we 
reported  uncertainty  bands  around  the  forecasts.  As  uncertainty  increases  over  time,  the 
uncertainty band takes the form of a fan (Figure 13). We now also publish uncertainty bands 
for the GDP and repo rate forecasts.  
The uncertainty that is reflected in the bands can be divided into three parts. It reflects the 
fact that we are uncertain about the current situation, regarding how the economy functions, 
and  about what  shocks  might  occur  during  the  forecast  period.  The uncertainty  bands  are 
constructed so they are symmetrical around our main scenario and for GDP growth and the 
inflation  rate  the  breadth  of  the  bands  is  calculated  with  the  aid  of  our  earlier  forecasting 
errors. This gives an incentive to make good forecasts, as large forecasting errors bear the 
penalty of broad uncertainty bands and the risk of reduced credibility in the forecasts.  
The uncertainty band for the repo rate cannot be calculated in the same way, as we have 
only  begun  to  make  our  own  forecasts  for  the  repo  rate  this  year.  There  are  quite  simply 
insufficient historical forecasts to use as a base. The uncertainty band for the repo rate has 
instead  been  constructed  with  the  aid  of  forecasting  errors  among  the  so-called  implied 
forward rates (Figure 14). The implied forward rates reflect market expectations of the repo 
rate.  One  problem  with  this  method  is  that  the  implied  forward  rates  have  systematically 
over-estimated the future repo rate path for a number of years. However, the over-estimation 
has  been  removed  from  the  forecasting  errors,  with  reference  to  the  fact  that  the  forward 
rates  also  consist  of  a  risk  premium  that  should  not  be  included  when  using  them  for 
forecasts. 
Different  central  banks  have  chosen  different  methods  of  illustrating  the  uncertainty  in  the 
forecasts and we regularly compare notes with one another. 
We are continuing to develop our forecasts 
The  conclusion  from  this  review  is  that  the  Riksbank’s  forecasts  on  the  whole  are  rather 
good, particularly one year ahead.  
We have made good forecasts for all variables, with the exception of productivity, one year 
ahead. This is reflected in the fact that we have made more accurate forecasts than the time 
series model and also in the fact that the correlations are relatively high between forecasts 
and outcomes. In addition, the bias is small for all variables one year ahead.  
We have a forecasting memory two years ahead for both employment and inflation. Although 
the  correlations  between  forecasts  and  outcomes  are  weak  one  year  ahead,  they 
nevertheless show a clear relationship. On the other hand, the study implies poor forecasting 
memory for GDP and productivity two years ahead. The correlations between the forecasts 
and outcomes are also weak for these variables two years ahead. We have seen that the 
6 
 BIS Review 138/2007
bias  is  larger  for  most  variables  two  years  ahead.  GDP  and  inflation  have  been  over-
estimated  slightly  during  the  period  studied,  and  employment  and  productivity  have  been 
under-estimated. 
Our  inflation  forecasts,  particularly  those  for  CPIX,  have  good  qualities  such  as  high 
correlation with outcomes and long forecasting memories. It is worth pointing out that this is 
the  variable  that  is  most  important  for  monetary  policy.  At  the  same  time,  the  uncertainty 
band shows that probability that inflation will be within the Riksbank’s tolerance interval of 1-3 
per cent two years ahead is only around 75 per cent, despite our forecast being that it will be 
two per cent. 
On the other hand, our forecasts for the real economy are not as accurate as the inflation 
forecasts, although they compare fairly well with the time series model’s forecasts.  
Our  forecasts  also  compare  fairly  well  with  those  of  other  forecasters.  The  result  of  the 
comparison with other forecasters shows that our GDP forecasts up to one year ahead are 
often  among  the  most  accurate.  This  also  applies  to  the  CPI,  but  here  the  difference  is 
smaller compared with the NIER and the Consensus panel. 
This does not mean that we have not occasionally made considerable forecasting errors. But 
the errors are not so systematic that there is reason to believe they are due to inadequate 
forecasting methods. And nor does this mean that we cannot or do not wish to become even 
better. We are constantly working to improve our methods. In some areas we need to work 
extra hard to improve our forecasting performance. One such area is productivity. 
It  is  important  that  we  continue  to  regularly  assess  monetary  policy,  and  particularly  with 
regard to our forecasts, both in our annual assessments and in other ways. This is necessary 
both to be able to gain better knowledge of which variables are difficult to forecast and to see 
where it is necessary to develop methods and analysis. A major advantage of publishing our 
forecasts is that external experts can also evaluate us.
