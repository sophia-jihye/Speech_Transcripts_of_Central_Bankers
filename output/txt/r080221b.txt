Durmuş Yilmaz: Press conference for the presentation of the inflation 
report  
Speech by Mr Durmuş Yilmaz, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at 
the press conference for the presentation of the inflation report, Central Bank of the Republic 
of Turkey, Ankara, 31 January 2008. 
 Distinguished Guests and Press Members, 
Welcome to the press conference for the presentation of the Inflation Report that is one of 
the  most  important  communication  tools  of  the  formal  inflation  targeting  regime  that  we 
implement.  
In  this  conference,  I  would  like  to  give  you  a  short  summary  of  our  evaluations  and  the 
Central Bank’s inflation forecasts which appear in the Inflation Report that will be posted on 
our website shortly today. 
An assessment of the year 2007 
1.  
I would like to start by a general assessment of inflation developments in the year 2007. 
The  monetary  tightening  exercised  since  mid-2006,  has  been  successful  in  leading  to  a 
significant reduction in the underlying inflation. Especially the 3.6 percentage points fall in the 
services  inflation,  which  confirmed  the  marked  disinflation  trend  during  2007,  was 
remarkable. The fall in headline inflation, however, was more limited, owing mainly to factors 
beyond  the  control  of  monetary  policy,  such  as  developments  in  energy,  food,  and 
administered  prices.  Accordingly,  inflation  realized  as  8.39  percent  at  the  end  of  2007, 
breaching the upper bound of the uncertainty band of 6 percent. On the other hand, annual 
CPI inflation excluding food, energy and tobacco products was at 4.8 percent (Figure1).

The  course  of  food  prices  has  been  main  factor  slowing  down  the  disinflation  process.  A 
prolonged shortage of rainfall in Turkey since Autumn 2006 has resulted in low crop yields in 
2007,  which  in  turn  translated  to  an  adverse  supply  shock.  Global  developments,  such  as 
increasing  bio-fuel  production,  strong  global  demand  for  food  and  consequent  rises  in 
BIS Review 20/2008

agricultural  commodity  prices,  further  added  to  the  domestic  food  inflation  through  the 
external trade channel. These factors had an impact not only on unprocessed food such as 
fresh  fruit  and  vegetables,  but  also  on  processed  food  such  as  grain  and  dairy  products. 
Accordingly,  annual  food  inflation  maintained  its  high  levels,  with  an  end-year  figure  of  12 
percent.  Hence,  food  prices  became  the  main  factor  impeding  the  disinflation  process  in 
2007, with a marked contribution of about 3.4 percent on headline inflation. The contribution 
of food prices to the headline inflation in 2007 was significantly higher than it had been in the 
past three years (Figure 2).

Another  major  factor  slowing  down  the  disinflation  process  in  2007  was  the  adverse 
developments in energy and administered prices. The crude oil price in December 2007 was 
nearly 50 percent above the levels registered at the end of 2006. This development, together 
with  the  changes  in  special  consumption  tax  on  fuel  products,  led  to  a  significant  rise  in 
prices  of  fuel-oil  products  in  2007.  Meanwhile,  another  energy  item,  housing  water  prices, 
which is administered by municipalities, edged up in the last quarter of 2007, partly owing to 
the drought conditions. Overall, 1.6 points of the headline inflation resulted from the energy 
price hikes, where the contribution of administered component outweighs that of the oil price 
(Table 1). While food, energy and tobacco products displayed significant increases in 2007, 
the fast pace of disinflation in services and core goods excluding food, energy and tobacco in 
2007,  confirms  that  supply  side  shocks  were  mainly  responsible  for  the  breach  of  the 
uncertainty band (Figure 3).

Distinguished Guests, 
Elevated  prices  of  crude  oil,  agricultural  products  and  other  commodities  exert  inflationary 
pressures all over the world. Recently, both the developed and emerging economies have 
been  facing  a  rise  in  inflation.  Inflation  in  Turkey  followed  a  more  favorable  trend  in  2007 
compared  to  other  emerging  economies  under  inflation  targeting,  notwithstanding  the 
administrative  price  hikes  in  November,  which  added  by  about  1-percentage  point  to  the 
Turkish CPI inflation. During the past year, inflation in Turkey declined to 8.4 percent from 
9.7  percent,  while  the  average  of  inflation  in  emerging  market  economies  under  inflation 
targeting  rose  from  3.4  percent  to  5.1  percent  (Figures  4&5).  Among  the  mentioned 
economies,  only  4  countries  experienced  a  decline  in  inflation  in  2007,  including  Turkey, 
which recorded the highest rate of decline. In other words, Turkey was the country with the 
largest rate of decline in inflation, in comparison with other economies in this group.

Monetary policy reaction and outcomes  
2.  
Distinguished Press Members, 
The monetary tightening exercised since June 2006 has had a manifest impact on private 
sector demand for the last one and a half year (Figures 6&7). In the first three quarters of 
4 
 BIS Review 20/2008
2007, the Gross National Product (GNP) increased by merely 4 percent, remaining at a level 
lower than previous years. Sorting out the underlying dynamics of growth developments is 
critical in shaping monetary policy decisions. It should be emphasized that while the limited 
GDP  growth  compared  to  previous  years  can  be  attributed  essentially  to  the  impact  of 
monetary tightening; the marked contraction in the agricultural sector also had a significant 
influence,  especially  on  the  reduced  growth  rate  in  the  third  quarter.  In  other  words,  the 
slowdown in growth resulted partially from the supply shock. As I have emphasized at the 
beginning  of  my  speech,  the  contraction  in  the  agricultural  sector  did  not  only  affect  the 
growth unfavorably, but it also pushed inflation up for a temporary period in 2007.

Despite  the  unfavorable  developments  in  food  prices,  almost  a  year  after  monetary 
tightening,  core  inflation  indicators  displayed  a  significant  deceleration  starting  from  the 
second quarter of 2007. The effects of tightening were clearly visible on the prices of durable 
goods  and  services  consistent  with  the  slowdown  in  the  economic  activity  in  the  related 
sectors.  The  weaker  demand,  coupled  with  a  strong  domestic  currency,  helped  durables 
inflation to come down significantly (Figure 8). In this respect, services inflation also eased 
remarkably,  declining  by  3.6  percentage  points  throughout  2007.  The  improvement  in 
BIS Review 20/2008

services inflation spread across all sub-items. Especially, the fall in rent inflation, the stickiest 
component of services inflation, was significant (Figure 9).

The significant deceleration in the core inflation indicators set the ground for a relatively less 
restrictive  monetary  policy.  Hence,  we  decided  to  start  the  measured  easing  cycle  in 
September  2007  with  a  25  basis-points  cut,  while  continuing  with  50  basis-points  in  the 
consecutive  three  meetings.  At  this  point,  I  have  to  underscore  that  monetary  policy 
remained  restrictive  even  after  these  rate  cuts.  Nevertheless,  we  underlined  the  need  to 
remain  cautious  against  the  risks  related  to  potential  second  round  effects  of  food  and 
energy prices as manifested in the sticky inflation expectations; and reduced the pace of rate 
cuts  in  January  2008.  Consequently,  policy  rates  were  lowered  by  200  basis  points  in  the 
period between September 2007 and January 2008 (Table 2).

Both the 12-month and 24-month ahead inflation expectations exhibited a declining pattern 
throughout  2007  (Figure  10).  However,  the  improvement  in  expectations,  especially  in  the 
last quarter, was rather limited, owing to backward looking behavior, and possibly due to pre-
announced  hikes  in  administered  energy  prices.  Nevertheless,  it  is  worthwhile  to  mention 
that  the  administrative  price  hikes  in  November  had  little  effect  on  medium-term  inflation 
expectations,  despite  the  upward  revision  in  the  year-end  inflation  expectations.  This 
observation shows that inflation target, to a significant extent, continue to serve as an anchor 
and  that  economic  agents  expect  the  disinflation  process  to  continue  in  the  medium  term. 
Nevertheless,  the  fact  that  currently  medium-term  inflation  expectations  are  significantly 
above our medium term target of 4 percent necessitates a cautious policy stance1.

Inflation and monetary policy outlook 
3.  
Distinguished Guests and Press Members, 
After  summarizing  inflation  and  monetary  policy  developments  in  2007,  in  this  part  of  my 
speech, I would like to share our evaluations on inflation and the monetary policy outlook.  
First  of  all,  I  would  like  to  summarize  several  factors  that  might  enable  the  disinflation 
process to continue in the upcoming period: 
Annual  percentage  change  in  CPI  excluding  food,  energy  and  tobacco  imply  an  inflation 
trend of 4.8 percent (Figure 11)2. In other words, underlying inflation in the past year was not 
far away from the medium-term targets. Therefore, under the assumption that oil and food 
inflation will follow a more benign path in 2008 than 2007, we expect some contribution to 
disinflation from the base effects.

We believe that existing supply and demand conditions continue to support disinflation. The 
sharp slowdown in the second half of 2006 created an ample slack in the economy (Graph 
12).  Although  domestic  demand  showed  some  signs  of  recovery  in  the  second  half  of  the 
year 2007, the pace of economic activity does not appear to be fast enough to eliminate the 
output gap. Moreover, the uncertainty created by the ongoing difficulties in the mature credit 
markets  is  expected  to  hold  back  the  domestic  consumer  and  investment  spending  in  the 
forthcoming  period.  Accordingly,  our  medium  term  projections  are  constructed  under  the 
assumption  that  demand  and  capacity  conditions  contribute  to  the  disinflation  process 
throughout 2008.  
                                                 
2   Official core  inflation measures, published  under the  name “Special CPI Aggregates“ (SCA),do not exclude 
processed food prices. We believe that excluding this item, in line with the international practice, could give a 
better proxy for recent inflation trends.

Monetary  conditions  continue  to  support  the  disinflation  process.  Despite  the  recent  rate 
cuts, monetary policy can still be considered to be in the restrictive territory. Underlying rate 
of  monetary  expansion  remains  modest,  consistent  with  a  relatively  restrictive  monetary 
stance. Although medium term interest rates followed a downward trend in the past quarter, 
2-year-real  rates  at  this  point  fluctuate  between  9  and  10  percent,  implying  a  non-
accommodative  monetary  stance.  Moreover, 
the  currency  remains  strong,  curbing 
inflationary  pressures  and  easing  the  impact  of  rising  commodity  prices  on  domestic 
production costs. (Figure 13).

Credit  data  also  confirm  that  monetary  conditions  are  still  non-accommodative.  Annual 
growth rates in the automobile and housing loans are at much lower levels compared to the

periods of vigorous domestic demand (Figure 14). Following the significant slowdown in the 
second  half  of  2006,  consumer  credits  showed  signs  of  recovery  after  the  first  quarter  of 
2007 (Table 3). However, we expect the cautious monetary policy stance and the tightening 
in global credit conditions are likely to restrain credit expansion in the forthcoming period.

External demand conditions are also expected to contribute to disinflation in 2008. Recent 
data on global economic activity suggest that world economic growth is likely to moderate in 
the forthcoming period, increasing the downside risks on external demand. Accordingly, our 
medium  term  outlook  is  constructed  under  a  baseline  scenario  of  gradual  slowdown  in 
external demand.  
Esteemed Press Members, 
Overall,  we  expect  aggregate  demand  conditions  to  support  the  downward  trend  in  the 
underlying inflation, i.e., inflation excluding items beyond the control of monetary policy such 
as  energy,  food  and  tobacco  prices.  Hence,  barring  new  supply  shocks,  headline  inflation 
should  continue  to  move  towards  the  target.  The  speed  of  the  convergence  to  the  target, 
however, will depend mainly on the course of food and energy prices.

 BIS Review 20/2008
Our forecast in the 2007 October Inflation Report incorporated two main assumptions: The 
assumption for oil price was set as 70 USD per barrel. Observing the high base created by 
the unusually elevated food prices in 2006, we assumed food inflation to correct towards the 
values  consistent  with  medium  term  inflation  in  2007.  However,  food  and  energy  inflation 
turned out to be more persistent than we had envisaged, as the prices of oil and agricultural 
commodities  continued  to  rise  throughout  2007.  These  developments  not  only  led  to  an 
undershooting of our inflation projections for end-year 2007, but also necessitated an upward 
revision in our medium term forecasts.  
In  this  framework,  we  revised  our  assumption  for  oil  prices  from  USD  70  to  USD  85  per 
barrel in 2008. Higher oil price assumption added about 0.5 percentage points to the end-
2008  inflation  forecasts.  Moreover,  the  first  round  impacts  of  the  recent  hikes  in  end-user 
electricity  and  natural  gas  prices  on  end-2008  inflation  are  expected  to  be  around  0.6 
percentage points, which is higher than what we assumed in the previous Inflation Report. 
Meanwhile,  considering  the  lagged  impacts  of  last  year’s  drought  and  elevated  prices  of 
agricultural  commodities  in  global  markets,  we  now  envisage  that  the  price  increases  in 
processed food will persist for a while and the inflation in this item will stay at relatively high 
levels throughout 2008, albeit a slight decline.  
Upside  revisions  on  the  assumptions  for  food  and  energy  inflation  imply  that  it  may  take 
longer to bring headline inflation to 4 percent than envisaged in our previous Inflation Report. 
Therefore,  in  the  absence  of  a  significant correction  in  food  inflation, headline  inflation  will 
most probably exceed the target level of 4 percent at the end of 2008.

 *The shaded region indicates the 70 percent confidence interval for forecast. 
 
Within  the  framework  that  I  have  drawn  up  so  far,  we  forecast  inflation,  with  70  percent 
probability, to be between 4.1 percent and 6.9 percent (midpoint 5.5) at the end of 2008, and 
between  1.8  percent  and  5.5  percent  (midpoint  3.7)  at  the  end  of  2009  (Figure  15).  The 
forecasts are based on the scenario in which policy rates display a limited decline in 2008. 
Main message of the forecast is that continuation of the gradual easing cycle that started in 
2007 September will remain conditional on favorable data and developments. In that sense, 
the  current  policy  stance  envisages  a  more  moderate  decline  in  policy  interest  rates  than 
indicated in the previous Inflation Report.  
I would like to emphasize once more that any new data or information on the inflation outlook 
may lead to a revision in the future policy stance of the Central Bank. Therefore, the policy 
path  that  was  indicated  above  should  not  be perceived  as  a  commitment  on  behalf  of  the 
CBRT.

Risks and monetary policy 
4.  
Distinguished Guests, 
I would like to dedicate the last part of my speech to the upside and downside risks to the 
inflation and monetary policy outlook in the upcoming period.  
The  main  upside  risk  factor  for  the  current  medium  term  inflation  outlook  pertains  to  the 
potential second round effects of the accumulated supply shocks, which may also create a 
higher  than  expected  inflation  inertia,  as  currently  manifested  in  the  medium  term  inflation 
expectations. So far, the second round impact of food prices has been limited and confined 
to selected sub-components of the overall index such as restaurants and catering services. 
The potential second round impact of elevated food and energy prices, however, on overall 
economy should not be overlooked. Therefore, the CBRT will keep a close eye on the price 
setting  behavior  along  with  various  core  inflation  measures.  In  the  upcoming  period,  the 
Central Bank will tolerate the first-round impacts on inflation resulting from food, energy and 
one-off  adjustments  in  administered  prices,  yet  remain  responsive  to  the  second  round 
effects such as possible deterioration in general pricing behavior.  
The Central Bank closely monitors the developments in global markets. The potential impact 
of  ongoing  difficulties  in  the  US  credit  markets,  on  the  financial  markets  and  the  real 
economy,  continue  to  create  uncertainty  about  the  course  of  the  global  economy.  Our 
baseline scenario assumes a soft landing in developed economies, with no major portfolio 
shock on the Turkish financial markets. However, the probability of a sharper than expected 
slowdown  should  not  be  ruled  out.  While  the  possibility  of  a  sharper-than  envisaged 
slowdown  in  global  economic  activity,  through  its  potential  impact  on  the  exchange  rates, 
may constitute an upside risk for the short term inflation outlook, it also poses downside risks 
for  inflation  in  the  medium  term  through  a  possible  weakening  in  external  demand  and 
domestic credit.  
It should be underlined that fiscal discipline of the past several years, by reducing the long-
term risk premium, has been the key force allowing the achievement of robust output growth 
during a remarkable disinflation period. In that sense, I believe it is useful to emphasize once 
more that maintaining the prudent fiscal policy during an episode of worsening risk appetite is 
even more critical for preserving the resilience of the economy. 
Our  medium  term  projections  are  based  on  the  assumption  that  government  expenditure 
targets will be met in 2008. Moreover, we assume that any extra need to readjust the primary 
budget balance will be implemented primarily through expenditure cuts rather than hikes in 
indirect taxes. Therefore the medium-term outlook that I mentioned above does not envisage 
major shocks arising from administered price adjustments, except the hikes in electricity and 
natural  gas  in  January  2008.  It  should  be  kept  in  mind  that  any  deviation  from  this 
assumption may alter the inflation and monetary outlook. 
The  recent  increase  in  end-user  energy  prices  may  continue  to  exert  some  temporary 
upward  pressure  on  headline  inflation  in  the  coming  months.  However,  these  adjustments 
will  also  support  lower  inflation  in  the  medium  term  as  they  contribute  to  a  prudent  fiscal 
stance  and  facilitate  an  expansion  of  the  domestic  energy  production.  Hence  the  central 
bank’s  policy  will  not  to  react  to  these  price  adjustments,  except  to  contain  second-round 
effects. 
Developments  in  food  prices  are  still  considered  as  an  important  risk  to  the  short-term 
inflation outlook, as food items constitute more than one fourth of the CPI basket. The course 
of  food  inflation  is  highly  dependent  on  domestic  weather  conditions  as  well  as  global 
developments. In the medium term, there is a significant chance of a downward correction in 
unprocessed  food  inflation,  especially  given  the  base  effect  created  by  the  last  two  years’ 
elevated  food  prices.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  also  possible  that  global  developments  and 
increasing  demand  for  certain  food  items  may  continue  to  push  up  the  food  prices. 
Therefore, food prices continue to pose risks to the inflation outlook on both sides.

 BIS Review 20/2008
So far, Turkish economy has been resilient to reappraisal of risks in global financial markets. 
The  support  of  fiscal  policy  and  structural  reforms  are  critical  in  shielding  the  economy 
against possible further deterioration in global sentiment. In this respect, the European Union 
accession process and the implementation of structural reforms envisaged in the economic 
program  remain  crucial.  Finally,  I  would  like  to  conclude  my  speech  by  mentioning  that 
advances  in  structural  reforms  enhancing  the  quality  of  fiscal  discipline  and  raising 
productivity  are  monitored  closely  with  regard  to  their  implications  on  macroeconomic  and 
price stability. 
Thank you.
