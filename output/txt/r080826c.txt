Durmuş Yilmaz: Press conference for the presentation of the Inflation 
Report  
Speech by Mr Durmuş Yilmaz, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at 
the press conference presenting the third issue of the Inflation Report, Central Bank of the 
Republic of Turkey, Ankara, 28 July 2008. 
 Distinguished Guests and Members of the Press,  
Welcome to the press conference for the presentation of the third issue of the 2008 Inflation 
Report, one of the most important communication tools of the full-fledged inflation-targeting 
regime that we have been implementing. 
In  this  conference,  I  would  like  to  give  you  a  short  summary  of  our  evaluations  and  the 
Central Bank’s inflation forecasts in the Inflation Report which will be posted on our website 
later today.  
Inflation developments 
1.  
Esteemed Members of the Press,  
I  would  like  to  start  with  a  general  assessment  of  inflation  developments  in  the  previous 
period and share with you the factors impeding the disinflation process in the first half of the 
year.  
Distinguished Guests,  
In April, both the Open Letter and the Inflation Report issued by the Central Bank of Turkey 
presented a detailed explanation for the factors impeding the disinflation process. The source 
of  inflation has  not  changed  in  the  past  quarter.  In  the  second  quarter  of  2008,  prolonged 
increases in food, energy and other commodity prices continued to exert significant upward 
pressures  on  headline  inflation.  As  a  consequence  6.8  percentage  points  of  the  10.61 
percent  annual  CPI  inflation  in  July  resulted  from  the  direct  impact  of  the  rise  in  food  and 
energy prices (Figure 1).

Food  price  developments  were  determinant  in  inflation  in  the  second  quarter  of  the  year. 
Although domestic weather conditions turned more favorable in the first half of 2008, lagged 
effects of last year’s poor harvest and continued elevation in agricultural commodity prices 
continued to keep processed food inflation at high levels. As a consequence, processed food 
inflation displayed a cumulative increase of 14.2 percent in the first half of the year (Figure 
2). At this point, I would like to remind you that the July Inflation Report, soon to be published 
on  our  website,  will  provide  a  detailed  explanation  on  the  factors  driving  domestic  food 
prices.

Developments  in  energy  prices  have  been  the  other  major  factor  driving  inflation  in  the 
second  quarter  (Figure  3).  Soaring  oil  prices  continued  to  lead  to  significant  hikes  in  the 
prices of domestic fuel products, also putting pressure on housing utilities such as electricity 
and natural gas.

Services  inflation  displayed  a  limited  rise  in  the  first  half  of  2008.  Food  and  energy  prices 
continued to exert upward pressures on the prices of catering and transport services. Rents 
and other services, on the other hand, continued to decelerate (Figure 4).

In the second quarter of 2008, core inflation indicators also showed an upward trend. The 
rise  in  core  inflation  in  the  second  quarter  should  be  viewed  as  a  temporary  movement 
arising from the exchange rate pass-through, rather than deterioration in the general price 
setting  behavior.  Ongoing  difficulties  in  global  credit  markets  coupled  with  domestic 
uncertainties have led to a depreciation of Turkish Lira vis-à-vis major currencies in the first 
four months of the year. As a consequence, first round effects of exchange rate pass-through 
BIS Review 100/2008

have been significant on the headline inflation as well as on core inflation figures during the 
March-May period. Yet, the recent rebound in Turkish lira and weakening domestic demand 
has limited the overall pass-through and consequently core inflation showed signs of easing 
in June. Currently, annual rate of increase in CPI excluding food, energy, tobacco and gold 
items stands at 6.4 percent, confirming that the inflation can be mostly attributed to factors 
beyond the control of the Central Bank of Turkey (Figure 5).

The  rise  in  inflation  rates  stands  out  to  be  an  ongoing  global  trend.  Elevated  commodity 
prices have continued to exert inflationary pressures all over the world. As depicted in the 
slide,  almost  all  emerging  economies  under  inflation  targeting  have  faced  significant 
breaches in their inflation targets (Figure 6).

Reaction of monetary policy  
2.  
Distinguished Guests and Members of the Press,  
After making brief remarks on the inflation developments in the previous period, in this part of 
my speech, I would like to touch on the policies carried out by the Central Bank during this 
process.  
In  the  April  Inflation  Report  and  the  open  letter  dated  April  2008,  we  indicated  that 
uncertainties  in  the  global  economy,  hikes  in  energy  prices,  and  the  risks  to  price  setting 
behavior compelled the monetary policy to be more responsive to the incoming information. 
In this framework, they revealed a clear tightening bias against increased risk related to the 
second round effects of the supply side shocks. Food and energy prices continued to rise in 
the second quarter of 2008 and financial markets remained under stress. In the meantime 
domestic uncertainties have intensified, having further adverse impact on the medium term 
inflation expectations. Accordingly, there has been a significant upward surge in the medium 
term inflation expectations in the second quarter of 2008 (Figure 7).

to  prevent 
to  contain  the  deterioration 
in  inflation  expectations  and 
In  order 
the 
materialization  of  the  second  round  effects  of  supply-side  shocks,  the  Monetary  Policy 
Committee tightened monetary policy in the past three months, increasing the policy rates by 
a cumulative of 150 basis points (Table 1). In current conjuncture, where the consumption 
demand  keeps  slowing  down,  I  would  particularly  like  to  emphasize  that  the  monetary 
tightening policy was adopted in order to halt the deterioration in inflation expectations and 
the  upsurge  in  the  risk  premium.  As  a  consequence,  the  deterioration  in  inflation 
expectations  ceased  and  market  rates  declined  in  July  (Figure  7).  In  other  words,  the 
monetary tightening policy conducted by the CBT contributed to the decline in medium and 
long-term interest rates by diminishing the inflation risk premium. 
At  this  point,  I  would  like  to  underline  an  operational  aspect  of  monetary  policy  relating  to 
policy rates. In the first half of 2008, excess liquidity sterilized in the overnight market shrank 
due to the  cut in the volume of daily FX-buying auction as well as the Treasury’s less FX 
borrowing  and  the  rise  in  money  demand.  These  developments  led  to  occasional  liquidity 
shortages.  By  May  2008,  liquidity  shortage  has  started  to  emerge  more  often  for  longer 
periods. During this period, the Central Bank provided the required liquidity into the system 
via one-week repo auctions, targeting overnight interest rates to materialize at levels close to 
Central Bank borrowing rate. Still, there has been some undesired volatility in the overnight 
rates due to unforeseen movements in the liquidity, mainly arising from the banks’ demand 
for reserves. Considering these developments, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided 
to reduce the margin between the borrowing and the lending rates by 50 basis points in July.  
Current  projections  do  not  point  to  a  permanent  shortage  in  the  liquidity  in  the  upcoming 
term.  In  case  of  temporary  shortage,  the  Central  Bank  will  provide  the  required  liquidity 
through one-week repo auctions, targeting the overnight interest rate in the money market to 
stay close to the Central Bank borrowing rate. Hence, the key policy rate will continue to be 
Central Bank’s overnight borrowing rate.

Inflation outlook and monetary policy  
3.  
Distinguished Guests, 
After summarizing the developments in the previous period, in this part of my speech, I would 
like  to  share  with  you  our  projections  about  the  inflation  and  the  monetary  policy  in  the 
upcoming period and the seasonally adjusted inflation forecasts of the Central Bank.  
Recent readings on supply and demand conditions are in line with the outlook presented in 
our  April  Inflation  Report  and  the  open  letter  of  April  2008.  Although  first  quarter  private 
consumption  growth  at  7.3  percent  appears  quite  strong  in  annual  terms,  the  seasonally 
adjusted  figures  point  to  an  ongoing  moderation  in  economic  activity  (Figure  8).  Recent 
readings on domestic sales, production and confidence indicators suggest a similar outlook. 
At this point, I would like to remind you that the indicators regarding the course of domestic 
demand are presented in detail in the July Inflation Report.

Data  on  consumer  credits  suggest  that  monetary  conditions  continue  to  be  restrictive. 
Consumer loans have been growing at a moderate pace compared to the periods of vigorous 
domestic demand (Figure 9). The decline in risk appetite and the tightening in global credit 
conditions are likely to restrain credit expansion in the period ahead.

Dear Guests,  
After the significant weakening of the Turkish lira in the first four months of 2008 (Figure 11), 
exchange  rates  have  reversed  direction  in  the  past  two  months,  easing  to  some  extent 
potential  pressures  on  tradable  inflation  resulting  from  the  exchange  rate  pass-through.  In 
the  April  Inflation  Report  and  the  Open  Letter,  the  first  round  impact  of  the  recent 
depreciation  was  estimated  to  be  close  to  2-percentage  points  for  the  end-2008  headline 
inflation.  The  recent  rebound  in  currency  has  led  to  a  downward  revision  in  the  estimated 
pass-through. We now anticipate a cumulative exchange pass-through of around 1.2 percent 
points for 2008, most of which has already been materialized between March-May period.

Longer-term  interest  rates  have  also  increased  in  2008  due  to  rising  risk  premium  and 
inflation expectations (Figure 12). Although higher market interest rates contain the domestic

demand and support disinflation, the impact of the heightened risk premium on the overall 
pricing behavior should be closely monitored.

Baseline  assumptions  in  the  April  Inflation  Report  envisaged  a  constant  path  for  oil  prices 
around 105 USD per barrel over the forecast horizon. However, oil prices continued to rise 
on the back of increasing international commodity prices, necessitating an upward revision 
(Figure 13). Taking the average future prices in the first three weeks of July as a benchmark, 
our baseline scenario for oil prices has been revised to USD 140 per barrel. As for the future 
adjustments in electricity tariffs – to be made within the scope of automatic pricing –, they are 
forecasted  to  be  in  compliance  with  the  assumption  for  the  oil  price.  This  revision  has 
increased  the  end-2008  inflation  forecast  by 1.8  percentage  points, and  also  added  to  the 
end-2009 forecasts 0.6 percentage points.

 BIS Review 100/2008
Members of the Press and Dear Guests, 
Our revised forecasts envisage slightly higher food inflation in 2008 and 2009 compared to 
the April Inflation Report. Although unprocessed food prices followed a relatively favorable 
course, processed food inflation is likely to stay at high levels for while, given the elevated 
course  of  agricultural  commodity  prices.  Against  this  backdrop,  we  have  raised  the 
assumptions for food inflation from 13 percent to 14 percent for the year 2008, and from 8 
percent to 9 percent for the year 2009. These changes have led to an upward revision in our 
inflation  forecasts  by  about  30  basis  points,  for  both  2008  and  2009.  The  projections 
envisage gradually moderating food inflation throughout the forecast horizon. In this context, 
assumption for 2010 food inflation is 7 percent.  
According to the framework drawn so far, we now forecast inflation to be around 10.6 percent 
at the end of 2008. Under the assumption of a limited tightening towards the end of 2008, our 
medium term forecasts suggest that, with 70 percent probability, inflation will be between 5.9 
and 9.3 percent (mid-point 7.6) at the end of 2009, and between 4 percent and 7.8 percent 
(mid-point  5.9)  at  the  end  of  2010  (Figure  14).  Our  inflation  forecast  for  mid-2011  is  5.4 
percent. We expect non-food inflation to be lower than these figures.

To  sum  up,  although  economic  activity  in  the  past  quarter  have  evolved  in  line  with  our 
expectations,  the  significant  increases  in  oil  and  processed  food  prices  have  led  to  an 
upward  revision  in  our  forecasts.  The  main  message  of  the  forecast  is  that  preventing  the 
materialization  of  potential  second  round  effects  and  ensuring  a  steady  decline  in  inflation 
towards the medium term targets, requires the monetary policy to maintain a cautious stance 
for a while.

Therefore,  the  path  for  the  policy  rates  indicated  above  should  not  be  perceived  as  a 
commitment on behalf of the CBT. I would like to once more emphasize that any new data or 
information regarding the inflation outlook may lead to a change in our policy stance.  
Risks and monetary policy 
4.  
Distinguished Guests, 
I  would  like  to  dedicate  the  last  part  of  my  speech  to  the  upside  and  downside  risks  to 
inflation and monetary policy in the upcoming period.  
Uncertainties about food and energy prices still continue. Our baseline scenario is based on 
quite conservative assumptions for food and energy prices, implying that downside risks on 
these factors are as apparent as upside risks. In order to enhance the predictability of the 
monetary policy, in a period when uncertainties pertaining to oil and agricultural commodity 
prices continue, we deem it to be useful to share with the public the inflation and monetary 
policy outlook, which is based on alternative scenarios for food and energy prices. 
In our pessimistic scenario, we assume that food price inflation materializes at 16, 12 and 10 
percent in 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively; whereas oil prices rise to USD 180 at the end 
of  2008,  staying  constant  thereafter.  Additionally,  adjustments  in  electricity  tariffs  are 
forecasted  to  be  made  in  compliance  with  this  assumption.  Assuming  a  gradual  monetary 
tightening during the rest of the year, our forecasts under this scenario suggest that inflation 
will be 9.1 percent at the end of 2009 and around 7 percent at the end of 2010 (Figure 15). 
In our optimistic scenario, we assume that food price inflation materializes at 12, 6, and 4 
percent respectively, in the 2008-2010 period, whereas oil prices ease to USD 100 at the end 
of  2008,  staying  constant  thereafter.  Additionally,  adjustments  in  electricity  tariffs  are 
forecasted to be made in compliance with this assumption. Assuming that policy rate stays 
constant for a while and gradually ease thereafter, our forecasts under this scenario suggest 
that  inflation  will  be  6.1  percent  at  the  end  of  2009  and  around  4.9  percent  at  the  end  of 
2010.  
In  sum,  monetary  policy  will  be  conducted  so  as  to  minimize  upside  deviations  from  the 
targets should the upside risks materialize. Downward surprises in food and energy prices, 
on the other hand, will be perceived as an opportunity to bring inflation back to target in a 
shorter period than envisaged in our baseline scenario.

Distinguished Guests, 
Despite the expected decline in inflation in the medium term, uncertainties exist regarding the 
degree  of  inflation  persistence.  Long-lasting  supply  shocks  have  been  keeping  headline 
inflation at elevated levels and thus increasing the risk of rising backward-looking schemes in 
the wage and price setting behavior. Although current demand conditions contain the second 
round effects of the supply shocks, the exact pace of disinflation would still depend on the 
extent new inflation targets serve as a strong reference for economic agents. Having this in 
mind, the CBT will continue to focus on enhancing the credibility of the new inflation targets. 
In  this  context,  developments  in  the  general  pricing  behavior  and  the  underlying  inflation 
trends will be monitored closely. 
International financial markets remain fragile and the credit conditions continue to tighten up. 
The eventual impact of the financial turmoil on the global economic activity is yet to be seen. 
Moreover,  rising  commodity  prices  continue  to  exert  pressure  on  global  inflation.  These 
uncertainties have been dampening the risk appetite and thus slowing down the capital flows 
to emerging markets, leaving these economies susceptible to shifts in the market sentiment. 
Domestic uncertainties have exacerbated these effects, as manifested by the significant rise 
in the sovereign credit risk of Turkey in the first half of the year, compared to the average risk 
premium  of  emerging  economies.  The  CBT  will  not  display  a  sharp  reaction  to  temporary 
fluctuations in the financial markets, unless there is a threat to the medium-term disinflation 
trend and/or a significant worsening in the general pricing behavior. 
Finally, I would like to state that our medium-term projections do not foresee any significant 
effect  to  be  brought  about  by  the  increases  in  indirect  taxes  or  administered  price 
adjustments,  except  those  required  by  the  automatic  pricing  mechanisms.  In  other  words, 
should  a  requirement  arises  for  a  tightening  in  the  public  budget,  we  assume  that  this 
requirement will be met by measures for cutting down on expenditures rather than increasing 
the indirect taxes. Any deviation from this framework may lead to a revision of the outlook for 
inflation and monetary policy. 
Distinguished Members of the Press, 
BIS Review 100/2008

A  protracted  period  of  rising  food  and  energy  prices  has  been  hampering  our  disinflation 
efforts  since  the  adoption  of  the  inflation  targeting  regime.  Ongoing  uncertainties  resulting 
from  global  as  well  as  domestic  factors  that  led  to  a  significant  deterioration  in  inflation 
expectations necessitated a more cautious monetary policy stance. In this respect, in order 
to  prevent  the  said  uncertainties  to  be  reflected  on  the  general  pricing  behavior,  we  have 
conducted  a  monetary  tightening  over  the  past  three  months.  Monetary  tightening  was 
effective  in  containing  inflation  expectations,  as  the  deterioration  in  inflation  expectations 
came to a halt in July. 
Current stance of the monetary policy supports disinflation. We expect inflation to remain at 
elevated  levels  in  the  short  term  before  gradually  moderating  towards  the  targets.  Our 
revised inflation forecasts suggest that the inflation targets of 7.5 percent, 6.5 percent, and 
5.5  percent  set  for  the  next  three  years  are  attainable,  even  under  quite  conservative 
assumptions on food and energy prices. I would like to underline that adverse impacts of the 
supply side shocks on the economy will be more limited should all the economic agents take 
these targets as a benchmark in forming their expectations.  
Prudent monetary policy is a necessary but not sufficient condition for attaining price stability. 
The support from fiscal policy and structural reforms are as critical as the monetary policy in 
this respect. Sound fiscal policy has been one of the main factors in driving inflation down to 
single digits. The role of fiscal policy will continue to be critical on the road to price stability. 
Preserving the resilience of the economy, especially under current conditions, requires the 
continuation of fiscal discipline and structural reforms. In this respect, the European Union 
accession process and the implementation of structural reforms envisaged in the economic 
program remain to be of utmost importance. I would like to conclude my remarks by stating 
that advances in structural reforms, which would improve the quality of fiscal discipline and 
enhance productivity, are monitored closely by the CBT with regard to their implications on 
macroeconomic and price stability. Thank you.
