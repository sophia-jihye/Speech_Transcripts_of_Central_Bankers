Stefan Ingves: Monetary policy and financial stability 
Speech by Mr Stefan Ingves, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, to the Riksdag Committee 
on Finance, Stockholm, 13 November 2008. 
 Counteracting the effects of the global financial crisis 
When  I  have  opened  my  daily  newspaper  in  recent  months  the  headings  have  often 
concerned crises, stock market collapse and economic downturn. The contagion effects of 
the  US  mortgage  crisis  that  have  been  around  since  summer  last  year,  have  taken  on 
proportions hardly anyone expected. In mid-September the international financial turbulence 
entered  its  most  intensive  phase  so  far.  The  global  financial  system  has  since  then  been 
shaken to its foundations and even countries like Sweden – far from the centre of the crisis – 
are tangibly affected.  
The Riksbank’s main tasks are to safeguard financial stability and price stability. To manage 
these  we  are  now  continuously  taking  various  measures  to  counteract  the  effects  of  the 
financial  turbulence  on  the  Swedish  economy.  Other  authorities,  the  Government  and  the 
Riksdag have also implemented measures to the same end. 
One thing I have learnt from the years I have worked with managing financial crises is that 
things can change rapidly. Each situation is unique and must be dealt with on the basis of the 
conditions prevailing there and then. Although Sweden has long been on the periphery of the 
turbulence in the financial markets, we are now more strongly affected. When the situation 
requires it, we must be flexible and act both quickly and powerfully. This is the way we have 
tried to work so far, and we will continue to do so as long as necessary.  
When I come here to the Committee on Finance hearing to answer questions on monetary 
policy, that subject is usually what my introductory speech concerns. Today it will be slightly 
different.  Recent  developments  clearly  show  how  closely  our  main  tasks,  financial  stability 
and monetary policy, are linked. I would therefore like to begin by talking about those points 
of contact and various measures we have taken to ensure that certain financial markets will 
function more normally. With this as a base, I will then move on to the interest rate decisions 
and the financial turbulence from a monetary policy point of view. Finally, I would also like to 
make a brief comment on our own experiences of earlier crises and the future of the global 
financial system. 
Monetary policy and financial stability – why is the system so important? 
One  can  say  that  the  payment  system  and  to  some  extent  the  financial  markets  are  the 
circulatory system of our economy. What is usually referred to as financial stability concerns, 
to put it simply, working in various ways to ensure the financial system is stable and functions 
efficiently. For example, individuals, companies and organisations must be able to make and 
receive payments in an efficient manner. When goods are transported to consumers via our 
physical  infrastructure,  such  as  the  road  network  or  by  air,  the  payment  for  the  product  is 
sent  to  the  end  recipient  by  means  of  the  “financial  infrastructure”.  If  the  financial 
infrastructure did not function, the economy would more or less grind to a halt. The financial 
system also makes it possible to manage various risks that can arise in the financial markets. 
This is important to both households and companies. 
Another important function is to be able to save and borrow money via the financial system. 
This gives households and companies the possibility to distribute incomes and consumption 
over  time.  The  funds  that  are  saved  can  be  borrowed  by  companies  and  households  to 
finance various investments which can then create employment and growth. When there is 
distrust and disturbances in the financial system, this function may be impaired, which can

lead to a credit crunch. First the financial sector is affected, but then it gradually becomes 
more  difficult  for  households  and  companies  to  borrow,  too.  Consumption  and  investment 
then  decline,  which  can  lead  to  a  substantial  economic  downturn.  A  credit  market  that 
functions well is thus an important condition for good growth. 
To  summarise,  one  can  say  that  the  financial  system’s  functions  are  very  important  for 
economic  development.  It  is  important  that  the  system  is  stable  for  our  society  to  function 
properly  on  the  whole.  But  financial  stability  is  something  that  most  people  probably  often 
take for granted. As long as everything is functioning well, the focus of public debate is much 
more often on our interest rate policy and the inflation target than on our stability task. But 
more recently, as the functioning of the financial markets has been hampered, the situation 
has almost been reversed. It has also become very clear how closely related our two main 
tasks are. 
The Riksbank’s most important tool in conducting monetary policy is the repo rate. One can 
say that we try to influence economic activity and inflation by steering the price of credit, that 
is, interest rates. But to be able to do this, the payment system and the credit markets must 
function so that the Riksbank’s interest rate decisions have an impact on other interest rates 
in the economy. Financial stability is in other words more or less a condition for being able to 
conduct monetary policy in an efficient manner. And of course it works both ways – monetary 
policy has significance for financial stability, not least through its impact on the banks and on 
economic activity. For instance, in an economic downturn the number of bankruptcies in the 
economy increases and so do the banks’ loan losses. 
A hiccup in the financial machinery 
In Sweden the market for the shortest interest rate in the economy, the overnight rate, has 
functioned more or less normally, with the interest rate close to the repo rate. So far so good. 
But  internal  distrust  and  uncertainty  within  the  global  system,  particularly  since  mid-
September, has made financial market participants reluctant to take risks and to lend money 
to  one  another  at  longer  durations.  It  has  become  expensive  and  difficult  to  find  funding, 
even for the Swedish banks who are “in good shape” and have good capital adequacy. It has 
been particularly difficult to borrow at slightly longer durations. 
The  banks  normally  have  what  may  be  called  financing  risk.  When  they  lend  money  to 
individuals and companies it is often on long-term contracts. This means that the bank finds it 
difficult to get its money back earlier if it needs it. The banks receive money deposits on a 
short term but they lend out money more long term; this is also expressed as deposits being 
liquid while loans are illiquid. As the functioning of the financial markets has deteriorated, the 
banks have been forced to refinance at shorter and shorter maturities, often only overnight. 
This has increased the banks’ financing risk. The fact that they have been forced to finance 
themselves at shorter durations has in itself increased the uncertainty over which banks can 
manage  their  financing,  and  this  has  contributed  to  even  greater  anxiety  and  a  lack  of 
confidence. When fewer and fewer market participants are willing to expose themselves to 
risk the banks’ access to credit declines. This in turn reduces the possibilities for households 
and companies to borrow money. This type of development can ultimately lead to a credit 
crunch. 
Interest  rates  on  longer-term  loans  between  the  banks;  interbank  rates,  have  been  much 
higher than normal. The demand for safe assets, such as treasury bills, has been very high 
at  the  same  time  as  the  demand  for  mortgage  bonds  and  high-risk  assets  has  been  very 
weak. Many interest rates, for instance, households’ mortgage rates, have risen much more 
than would normally be motivated by the Riksbank’s interest rate and forecasts of the future 
development  of  the  repo  rate.  This  means  in  practice that access  to credit  for  households 
and companies is tightened even without the Riksbank having raised the interest rate. The 
fact that it is more expensive and more difficult to borrow affects economic activity.

 BIS Review 138/2008
In  a  situation  where  the  markets  are  affected  by  uncertainty,  it  is  also  possible  that  the 
interest rates faced by the general public do not follow suit when the Riksbank cuts the repo 
rate. One can say that the repo rate then becomes a blunter instrument than normal and that 
its impact is weaker. Such a situation could therefore require more powerful adjustments to 
the interest rate than would otherwise have been necessary. 
Measures to ensure the financial system functions more normally 
It is thus very important from several aspects that the financial system functions well. And it 
is the Riksbank’s task, as written in law “to promote a safe and efficient payment system”. 
This means in practice that the Riksbank regularly analyses risks and threats to the stability 
of the Swedish financial system. The purpose is to detect changes and vulnerabilities that 
can lead to a serious crisis and in various ways to prevent such a situation from arising. We 
also  maintain  a  good  level  of  crisis  preparedness  and  carry  out  different  types  of  crisis 
exercise. This means that we are well prepared to act if a situation arises whereby stability is 
threatened.  
When shocks occur in the financial system we have different tools for managing the situation. 
An important part of this is providing information, highlighting risks and conducting a dialogue 
with financial market participants. The Riksbank also has the possibility to supply the system 
with  liquidity  or  to  provide  liquidity  to  financial  companies  under  the  supervision  of 
Finansinspektionen,  the  Swedish  Financial  Supervisory  Authority,  that  are  solvent  but  lack 
sufficient  liquidity  to  manage  their  payments.  This  gives  the  Riksbank  a  central  role  in  a 
financial crisis situation which is often connected with this type of problem. It is usually said 
that the Riksbank can in such cases act as lender of last resort. 
Other authorities working with these issues in different ways are Finansinspektionen and the 
Swedish  National  Debt  Office.  As  those  of  you  here  are  well  aware,  the  Riksdag  and  the 
Government  also  contribute.  This  can  be  by  formulating  legislation  and  regulatory 
frameworks, or by intervening with measures in those cases where those of the authorities 
do  not  suffice.  One  example  is  the  stability  plan  for  the  financial  system  decided  by  the 
Riksdag  just  over  two  weeks  ago.  This  was  a measure  that  the  Riksbank  welcomes.  With 
regard  to  legislation,  I also  believe  that  further  supplementary  measures  will  be  needed  in 
future. I will return to this later on. 
During the recent financial turbulence the Riksbank has not only had regular contacts with 
other  authorities  and  the  political  system  –  we  have  also  had  closer  contacts  with  market 
participants than usual. Central banks around the world have also had close cooperation with 
regard to reducing the strains in the financial markets in various ways. So what have we at 
the Riksbank done to make the markets function better?  
Improving the functioning of the markets  
The  Swedish  banks  have  mainly  experienced  two  problems.  One  has  been  the  lack  of 
access  to  more  long-term  funding  in  Swedish  kronor.  The  other  has  been  the  limited 
possibilities to borrow in US dollars. As I mentioned earlier, it has been much more difficult 
and costly for the banks to obtain financing other than at very short maturities. The banks’ 
possibility  to  finance  themselves  is  of  course  important  to  financial  stability.  It  also  affects 
other  interest  rates  in  the  economy  and  thereby  the  impact  of  monetary  policy.  We  at  the 
Riksbank try to counteract these effects of the financial turmoil. We have therefore offered 
the  banks  financing  –  against  collateral  and  at  an  interest  rate  –  at  longer  durations  than 
normal, and than what is currently available in the markets. We have so far granted loans in 
Swedish kronor at maturities of three months and six months to a total of SEK 203 billion. 
One can say that we in this way replace part of the bank’s short-term financing with more 
long-term financing. This reduces their financing risk. It is important to point out that these 
measures  do  not  have  any  direct  monetary  policy  effects.  The  Riksbank  supplies  liquidity 
BIS Review 138/2008

with regard to loans of longer maturities, but at the same time withdraws the same amount of 
loans with short maturities at the repo rate.  
Another  problem  for  the  Swedish  banks  has  been  the  shortage  of  loans  in  US  dollars. 
Therefore we have also offered the banks loans in US dollars. Both the loans in kronor and 
the  loans  in  US  dollars  have  the  aim  to  maintain  financial  stability  by  creating  the  right 
conditions for the markets to return to a more normal situation. This is also the aim of the 
Swedish National Debt Office’s extra issues of treasury bills. A further effect of the measures 
is  to  improve  the  functioning  of  the  mortgage  bond  market.  For  instance,  the  Riksbank 
accepts  covered  mortgage  bonds  as  collateral  for  its  loans  to  the  banks.  In  addition,  the 
money from the Swedish National Debt Office’s extra issues of treasury bills is mainly being 
invested in mortgage bonds.  
To increase access to credit also for non-financial companies, the Riksbank has introduced a 
new  temporary  possibility  for  the  banks  to  borrow  against  collateral  consisting  of  more 
commercial  paper  than  before.  This  means  that  the  companies  can  obtain  financing  by 
issuing commercial paper and selling to the banks, which can in turn use this as collateral to 
borrow from the Riksbank. The interest on the loans provides compensation for risk and time 
to maturity and the banks can only use the credit facility if they buy new commercial paper. If 
large companies outside of the financial sector gain greater access to credit, then the banks 
should have more scope to lend more money to small and medium-sized enterprises as well.  
Liquidity assistance on special terms 
The  Riksbank  has  also  provided  special  liquidity  assistance  to  two  Swedish  financial 
institutions, namely Kaupthing Bank Sverige AB and Carnegie Investment Bank AB. These 
loans  have  been  granted  against  collateral  and  at  an  interest  rate  that  is  higher  than  the 
normal  borrowing  cost.  Although  neither  of  these  two  market  participants  has  a  dominant 
position  in  the  Swedish  market,  the  Riksbank  chose  in  both  cases  in  the  current  turbulent 
market  situation  to  grant  liquidity  assistance  to  prevent  serious  disruptions  to  the  financial 
system and to maintain confidence in Sweden’s credit and payment systems. The decisions 
were  based  on  assessments  that  the  participants  were  solvent,  but  that  they  nevertheless 
were unable to acquire the necessary liquidity themselves to meet their payment obligations.  
With  regard  to  this  type  of  loan,  liquidity  assistance  on  special  terms,  it  is  important  to 
remember why they are being granted. The issue is to safeguard the financial system and 
important social values. It is not a case of rescuing banks and bank management for their 
own sake or that of the shareholders or of “giving away taxpayers’ money” as it is sometimes 
wrongly described in the debate.  
In the long term we need a well-developed system for managing insolvent institutions  
The  Riksbank’s  possibility  to  provide  liquidity  assistance  to  a  financial  institution  when 
financial stability is threatened assumes that the institution is solvent and able to continue to 
pursue its operations. In the case of Carnegie, Finansinspektionen withdrew the institution’s 
licence to conduct banking operations on Monday this week. The Riksbank then withdrew its 
liquidity assistance to the bank, is it no longer met the criteria for being granted this type of 
credit.  The  Riksbank’s  loan  to  Carnegie  Investment  Bank  AB  has  been  repaid  by  the 
Swedish National Debt Office, which has taken over the debt and now owns the company. 
The Debt Office can now take over a financial institution, as in Carnegie’s case. This applies 
in a situation where an institution that does not meet the requirements for liquidity assistance 
from the Riksbank has to default on its payments and this is assessed to threaten financial 
stability. This is made possible by the stability plan for the financial system decided by the 
Riksdag  just  over  two  weeks  ago.  The  stability  plan  also  means  that  the  government  can 
extend guarantees to individual institutions or to a group of institutions. These are important 
components for putting together a suitable financial safety net and I welcome the Riksdag’s 
4

decision. I also believe that it would be good if we further develop this legislation in the long 
term.  It  should  be  possible  for  the  government  to  reconstruct  a  credit  institution  without 
having  to  take  over  ownership.  And  it  is  not  only  in  situations  where  financial  stability  is 
seriously threatened that such laws and regulations are needed for banks and other credit 
institutions. It is important for the credibility of the banking system as a whole that there is a 
regulatory framework which amongst other things enables depositors to quickly regain their 
money. 
Monetary policy and the financial crisis 
A  small,  export-dependent  economy  like  Sweden’s  is  not  unaffected  by  world  economic 
activity and what is happening in the global financial system. In a way, I think that one can 
say  that  the  distinction  between  monetary  policy  and  financial  stability  is  erased  when  a 
financial crisis breaks out. If one does not forcefully counteract the crisis, there is a risk that it 
will have a strong impact on inflation and growth. The decline in production and employment 
can then be both profound and prolonged.  
Monetary  policy  cannot  solve  all  of  the  problems  in  the  financial  markets.  This  requires 
additional measures. And as I said, such measures are now being taking in most parts of the 
world now, as well as in Sweden. But monetary policy can alleviate the effects of the financial 
crisis  on  the  economy.  The  Riksbank  has  also  implemented  monetary  policy  measures, 
largely as a result of the international financial crisis. In the space of just over two weeks, we 
cut the interest rate on two occasions, by a total of one percentage point, to 3.75 per cent.  
Rapid change in the situation when anxiety escalates in mid-September 
Normally, we raise or cut the repo rate in smaller steps and emphasise that it is a series of 
interest rate decisions and not one single interest rate adjustment that is important. When we 
raised  the  interest  rate  by  0.25  percentage  points  at  the  beginning  of  September  it  still 
appeared  as  though  the  Swedish  financial  markets  would  be  relatively  spared  from  the 
effects of the financial turmoil then prevailing in the world markets. The majority assessment 
of  the  Executive  Board  was  that  inflationary  pressures  were  too  high  for  the  economic 
downturn  to  bring  inflation  back  to  the  target  of  2  per  cent  quickly  enough  without  a  high 
interest rate. Of course, we did not know then that the international economic situation would 
soon look very different, although we were aware of both upside and downside risks. 
Just  over  a  week  later,  investment  bank  Lehman  Brothers  suffered  serious  problems  and 
filed  for  bankruptcy  protection,  in  accordance with  US  bankruptcy  legislation.  The  financial 
anxiety then escalated considerably. We were soon in a situation where the global financial 
crisis paralysed many credit markets. It became clear that the crisis severely aggravated the 
ongoing  economic  downturn,  which 
falling  commodity  prices  had  a 
considerable dampening effect on inflationary pressures. Both we and others assessed that 
a rapid and substantial interest rate cut was necessary to alleviate the effects of the crisis. 
On 8 October the Riksbank and several other central banks, including the Bank of England, 
the ECB and the Federal Reserve, decided to cut our policy rates in a joint action. This action 
has later been followed by several interest rate cuts by central banks around the world. Last 
week, for instance, the ECB cut its policy rate by half a percentage point and the Bank of 
England cut its rate by 1.5 percentage points.  
together  with 
The most recent interest rate decision 
Just over two weeks’ later, at the monetary policy meeting held on 22 October, the Executive 
Board of the Riksbank decided to cut the repo rate by a further 0.5 percentage points to 3.75 
per  cent.  In  our  forecast  for  the  future  repo  rate  we  are  also  expecting  that  it  will  be 
necessary to cut the rate by a further 0.5 percentage points within six months. The purpose 
is  to  alleviate  the  effects  of  the  financial  crisis  on  production  and  employment,  and  at  the 
BIS Review 138/2008

same time to attain the inflation target of 2 per cent. In the current situation with considerable 
uncertainty  in  the  world  economy,  it  is  important,  as  I  said  at  the  beginning,  that  we  are 
flexible  and  prepared  to  act  quickly  and  forcefully.  One  expression  of  this  is  that  we  are 
expecting to all in all cut the interest rate by a relatively large amount during a short period of 
time.  
Less impact than usual to begin with 
The effects of the lower repo rate will probably initially be weaker than usual. As I mentioned 
recently, the confidence crisis and the uncertainty in the financial system have led to high risk 
premiums. This means that some market rates are not affected by the development of the 
repo rate in the same way as usual. For instance, it is not certain that the loan costs faced by 
households and companies will fall as much as they usually do when the repo rate is cut. To 
correct  the  problems  in  the  fixed-income  and  credit  markets  it  is  necessary  to  implement 
other measures beside monetary policy. But this is, as I mentioned earlier, something we and 
other authorities are working on, both in Sweden and abroad.  
Other effects of the international financial crisis 
One important reason for the interest rate cut is that the crisis in the financial markets has led 
to  higher  loan  costs  for  companies  and  households  than  we  had  anticipated  in  our 
assessment  at  the  beginning  of  September.  Access  to  credit  has  also  declined.  As  I 
mentioned earlier, this has a restraining effect on the economy, not least in that investments 
fall. Developments on stock markets around the world have fluctuated considerably and on 
the whole there has been a substantial fall. In many countries property prices are also falling, 
but in Sweden the decline has on the whole been fairly limited so far. However, all in all this 
development has led to a decline in wealth for many Swedish households, which is expected 
to  dampen  consumption.  Various  surveys  indicate  that  households  and  companies  have  a 
more pessimistic view of the future now.  
The  financial  crisis  has  contributed  to  a  deterioration  in  the  prospects  for  global  economic 
activity and to dampening international demand. The price of many commodities, such as oil 
and food, has fallen. This gives lower inflationary pressures. When international demand is 
lower, the Swedish economy is also affected via exports. We are assuming that exports will 
slow down next year, but recover during 2010. 
It  is  also  clear  that  the  uncertainty  in  the  economy  has  increased  in  general.  This  affects 
households’  and  companies’  financial  decisions  regarding  the  future.  The  uncertainty  can 
also have contributed to the recent substantial weakening in the Swedish krona against most 
other  currencies.  It  is  not  unusual  that  the  value  of  currencies  of  small  and  very  export-
dependent economies, like Sweden’s, falls in times of market turbulence. This was the case, 
for instance, after the Asia crisis and the acts of terrorism on 11 September 2001. Although a 
weaker exchange rate contributes to boosting exports, the effects are limited if international 
demand is low. At the same time, a weak krona provides higher imported inflation. We are 
expecting the exchange rate to strengthen in the slightly longer term, but to remain weak until 
the most acute stage of the crisis is over.  
To summarise in brief, we are assuming that the financial crisis will in various ways make the 
wheels  of  the  economy  turn  much  more  slowly.  Growth  is  expected  to  slow  down  both  in 
Sweden and abroad. Our forecast is that the increase in GDP in Sweden, Europe and the 
United States will remain around zero next year, but recover in 2010 and 2011. 
The labour market, resource utilisation and inflation 
In that the financial crisis aggravates the ongoing economic downturn, we are assuming that 
the  labour  market  will  show  weaker  development  and  that  inflation  will  be  lower  than  we 
forecast  at  the  beginning  of  September.  Resource  utilisation  in  the  economy  is  still  at  a 
6 
 BIS Review 138/2008
slightly  higher  level  than  normal.  However,  we  are  assuming  that  it  will  fall  rapidly  and  be 
somewhat lower than normal over the coming years. Inflation is still high at the beginning of 
the forecast period. But during next year we are expecting it to fall rapidly. Opinion polls also 
indicate that inflation is expected to be lower in the future. Our assessment is that inflation 
will be below two per cent in 2009. It will then rise slightly and be on target in 2011. 
Considerable uncertainty in the assessment 
I would like to add that the uncertainty in our assessment is unusually large on this occasion. 
As always, it is therefore important to remember that the path we present for the repo rate is 
a forecast and not a promise. It may be necessary to cut the rate more, or less, than we are 
assuming now. If the financial crisis worsens, or if the effects on production and employment 
are more powerful than we believe, a lower interest rate might be necessary. However, if the 
krona were to remain weak or if inflation were to become entrenched at a high level, a higher 
interest rate might be necessary. The interest rate decisions we will make in the future will 
depend quite simply on how new information affects the outlook for inflation and economic 
activity in Sweden. We are following developments closely and are prepared to take action 
when necessary. 
A concluding reflection  
Around 15 years ago I was appointed head of the Swedish Bank Support Authority. Sweden 
was  in  the  midst  of  a  deep  economic  crisis;  a  crisis  which  had  largely  been  caused  by 
problems on home ground. The situation was serious, not least for the bank system, where 
loan  losses  during  the  recession  totalled  record  sums.  The  Bank  Support  Authority  was 
established as one of the measures taken to prevent the collapse of the Swedish financial 
system, in particular the payment system. Today we are once again in a situation where such 
bank support authorities are being established in many parts of the world, including Sweden. 
We are also facing a period of poorer economic activity. But this time the situation is very 
different for Sweden. 
Experience and measures have given resilience 
The anxiety that has had a stranglehold on the financial markets since the end of September 
comes from outside this time, not from problems in the Swedish bank sector. Swedish banks 
have on the whole shown much  more responsible credit granting, both compared with the 
years following credit deregulation and compared with parts of the US mortgage market. The 
banks have good capital buffers and can manage substantial loan losses, even if they are 
nevertheless  affected  by  the  general  mood  of  distrust  on  the  market.  We  are  also  much 
better equipped in many ways to meet an economic downturn than we were at the beginning 
of the 1990s. I am thinking here of the effects of the changeover in monetary and fiscal policy 
after  the  crisis,  and  the  fact  that  we  now  have  sound  public  finances  and  a  substantial 
surplus on the current account.  
Although a small, open economy like Sweden’s is never immune to what is happening in the 
world economy, and particularly to an international financial crisis, we learnt a lot from the 
difficult years in the 1990s. This applies to the banks as well as to the supervisory authorities 
and the political system. We tackled many difficult problems, although it was unpleasant, and 
resolved  their  underlying  causes.  This  has  definitely  given  us  better  resilience  to  what  is 
happening now. 
At what stage is the global financial system now? 
The global financial system is currently in the middle of such a process. Deficiencies in the 
system  that  have  lain  in  wait  in  many  parts  of  the  world  have  now  come  into  focus  in  an 
BIS Review 138/2008

acute  situation.  This  includes  supervision,  regulatory  frameworks  and  the  possibility  for 
insight with regard to somewhat fanciful constructions of financial instruments. And it is not 
only  the  regulations  and  supervision  that  need  to  be  reviewed  and  harmonised  between 
countries – the same applies to the frameworks for crisis management and financial stability. 
Otherwise one country’s crisis management can easily become another country’s problem. 
We  can  now  see  examples  of  initiatives  taken  towards  better  and  more  coordinated  crisis 
management in the EU, for instance. 
Now  we  are  facing  the  task  of  fixing  what  is  broken  so  that  it  will  stay  fixed  and  function 
better in the future. This applies both to resolving the deadlock on certain markets and the 
distrust that has been created within the financial system, as well as putting the problems to 
rights in the long term. Some measures have already been taken and more are on the way. It 
is  not  a  simple  process  and  it  will  probably  take  some  time  before  the  measures  take  full 
effect. But once we have closed the accounts on this crisis, we will hopefully have purged the 
parts  that function  poorly  and  replaced  them  with  something  better.  It  is  necessary  for  the 
financial system to function in a safe and efficient manner for the central banks to be able to 
conduct monetary policy efficiently. This is a necessary condition for good and sustainable 
economic  development  on  the  whole.  I  have  every  hope  that  we  can  work  together  to 
achieve this!
