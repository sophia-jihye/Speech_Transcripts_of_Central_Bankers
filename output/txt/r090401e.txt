Anna Maria Tarantola: Cooperative banks and competition – local 
vocation and governance issues 
Address by Ms Anna Maria Tarantola, Deputy Director General of the Bank of Italy, at the 
Istituto  Centrale  delle  Banche  Popolari  –  Associazione  Nazionale  delle  Banche  Popolari 
“Cooperative Banks: Italian and European Aspects”, Taormina, 27 February 2009. 
 Introduction 
I  would  like  to  thank  the  organizers  for  inviting  the  Bank  of  Italy  to  take  part  in  today’s 
meeting in honour of Professor Giuseppe Muré, a man of great distinction, who combined an 
academic  career  with  his  role  as  representative  of  the  banking  profession,  offering  a 
constructive contribution to the complex issues surrounding the business of banking.  
The role of local banks was a theme that Professor Muré examined on many occasions in 
the course of work on a broad range of topics, and he was always passionately convinced of 
their  valuable  role  in  supporting  SMEs.  At  a  meeting  on  “Dimensions  and  Processes  of 
Growth” some twenty  years ago, he stressed “the competitive advantage of a bank with a 
local  dimension,  which  as  we  all  know  can  adhere  to  the  economic  fabric  of  its  place  of 
business” and emphasized that this fundamental resource should not be wasted  − indeed, 
that local banks should preserve their local identity.1  
The  value  of  the  business  model  adopted  by  Italy’s  cooperative  “popular  banks”  (banche 
popolari)  is  a  very  topical  issue.  It  is  at  the  centre  of  a  lively  debate  concerning  the 
transformations  that  the  category  of  cooperative  banks  has  undergone,  as  well  as  the 
economic and productive slowdown, both of which draw attention to the relationship between 
bank and local area.  
I will begin my talk by looking at how the banche popolari have evolved in the Italian system 
and how this fits into the European context of cooperative lending before examining their role 
in supporting the economy and analyzing their main technical characteristics. Finally, I will 
look  at  their  particular  system  of  governance  and  consider  prospective  regulatory 
developments.  
In  general,  the  banche  popolari  have  responded  to  increasing  competitive  pressure  by 
reviewing and revising their strategies. Large-scale banks have been created, with diversified 
production, complex group structures, and establishments abroad as well as at home. Small 
banks of limited operational complexity continue to exist alongside them.  
While  more  and  more  marked  differences  have  emerged  within  the  category,  regulations 
have  remained  largely  the  same.  We  must  consider  whether  this  framework  is  still 
appropriate  to  the  changed  needs  of  banks,  investors  and  clients  and  to  the  aims  of  the 
supervisory authority. 
The role of banche popolari in the development of Italy’s banking system 
1.  
Italy’s  banking  system  has  undergone  profound  changes  in  the  last  decade:  in  size,  in 
manner  of  operation  and  in  organizational  structure.  Rapid  progress  in  information  and 
communication  technology,  financial  innovation,  growing  international  openness,  and 
changes in demand for banking and financial services have all led to stronger competition

and  prompted  a  far-reaching  process  of  concentration  among  banking  institutions  and  a 
rationalization of their productive structures. 
Mergers have led to an increase in the average size of banks, more complex and structured 
forms of group organization, and a diversification of customer relation policies and methods. 
The number of banks has decreased, but the enormous growth of branch networks has kept 
competition strong in local banking markets.  
Closer financial integration in Europe has encouraged the market to open up to EU banks, 
particularly in recent years, and Italian banks to venture abroad.  
In  a  rapidly  evolving  sector,  the  cooperative  banks,  for  their  part,  have  proved  extremely 
dynamic while evolving in a variety of directions, depending on their different initial situations 
and the opportunities offered by their local economies.  
One segment of the cooperative banking sector has consolidated its position in its chosen 
markets,  focusing  on  internal  growth  and  successfully  enacting  the  role  of  local  bank  with 
close connections with the fabric of small and medium-sized enterprises. The largest banche 
popolari,  on  the  other  hand,  have  concentrated  on  external  growth,  carrying  out  broad 
merger  programmes,  both  within  their  category  and  outside,  by  acquiring  former  savings 
banks,  local  banks  set  up  in  the  form  of  public  limited  companies,  banche  di  credito 
cooperativo (mutual banks) and specialized banks. This has led to the formation of medium 
and large-sized groups that operate beyond regional borders. In some cases growth has led 
to changes in ownership structure − and greater market openness − as well as entry into new 
lines of business. 
Both growth paths have greatly reinforced the category of cooperative banks as a whole. In 
the  last  decade,  despite  a  reduction  from  56  to  38  in  the  number  of  independent  banche 
popolari and groups headed by banche popolari, their market share in Italy has risen from 
16.8 to 21.1 per cent of total bank assets, from 15.9 to 21.6 per cent of lending to residents 
and from 21.1 to 27.3 per cent of branches.  
There  has  been  a  parallel  sharpening  of  differences  within  the  category.  In  1998  the  five 
largest groups headed by  banche popolari ran an average of 526 branches, while  banche 
popolari not belonging to groups had 16 each; today those figures are respectively 1,340 and 
23.  The  average  value  of  the  top  five  groups’  total  assets  was  ten  times  that  of  the  other 
banche  popolari,  a  ratio  that  is  now  close  to  25:1.  Of  the  16  banking  groups  headed  by 
banche popolari, two are among the top five in Italy in terms of total assets and eight are 
listed on the stock exchange or have at least one listed member. 
The  leading  groups  have  adopted  a  more  structured  organization,  for  the  most  part  of  the 
multifunctional federal type.  
Cooperative banks in the European context 
2.  
Cooperative banks are a key component of the cooperative movement in the credit sector, 
which  originated  in  Europe  in  the  nineteenth  century  as  a  response  to  the  problems  that 
small  urban  and  rural  businesses  had  in  obtaining  credit.  From  the  very  first  credit  unions 
promoted by Schulze-Delitzsch and Raiffeisen, they adopted an organizational model based 
on democratic governance and mutualism. In time, this model evolved and differentiated into 
a multiplicity of institutions with characteristics reflecting the needs of cooperative members 
on the one hand and the specificities of national legislative frameworks on the other. 
Today,  the  cooperative  credit  sector  in  Europe  embraces  systems  that  are  not  entirely 
uniform  in  terms  of  legal  set-up,  size  and  organization.  Some  systems  are  strongly 
integrated. This is the case in Germany, where the Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken are 
joined in a single trade association and have common central structures (DZ Bank), and in 
the  Netherlands,  whose  cooperative  banks  are  gathered  together  in  the  Rabobank  group, 
one of the country’s largest banking groups. Other systems are more highly diversified, as in 
2 
 BIS Review 40/2009
France,  whose  cooperative  system  includes  three  of  the  country’s  five  largest  banking 
groups (Crédit Agricole, Caisse d’Épargne and Crédit Mutuel) plus the Banques Populaires 
group consisting of a federal bank and 20 regional banks with more than 3,000 branches. 
Cooperative banks’ ability to adapt and to grow in highly diverse economic and institutional 
environments has made them a substantial part of the banking industry in many European 
countries. Overall, the cooperative banking sector in the European Union counts more than 
4,000 local and regional banks, 62,000 branches and 49 million members, with a significant 
incidence  in  their  national  markets.2  Although  comparing  international  data  involves  some 
difficulty, we can put cooperative banks’ market shares in terms of number of branches at 
about  60 per  cent  in  France,  50  per  cent  in  Austria,  40  per  cent  in  Germany  and  the 
Netherlands, and 10 per cent in Spain and Portugal.3 In Italy, the figure is 39 per cent for the 
entire cooperative banking sector. 
In  the  other  European  countries,  cooperative  banks  have  developed  mainly  in  a  context, 
including the legal and institutional framework, in which central organizations play a driving 
role. In Italy, by contrast, the movement has been marked by greater differentiation between 
mutual banks (banche di credito cooperativo) and popular banks (banche popolari), with less 
integration and autonomous paths of development being preferred. 
Each model has its strengths and weaknesses. Close coordination at central level can help 
overcome constraints and inefficiencies due to the small size of individual cooperative banks. 
On  the  other  hand,  in  banking  as  in  other  industries,  entrepreneurial  autonomy  fosters 
competition, the quest for innovative solutions, and the ability to adapt to the needs of local 
economies. 
Support for the economy 
3.  
The presence of a varied range of intermediaries constitutes an asset for the Italian banking 
system and has proven invaluable for the country’s economic growth. In particular, thanks to 
the  social  and  solidaristic  concerns  inherent  in  their  corporate  model,  Italy’s  cooperative 
banks not only assist categories of customers at risk of exclusion from the credit market and 
thus vulnerable to usury, but have also actively sustained specific segments of the market, 
such as small and medium-sized enterprises. It is on the basis of these premises that Italian 
legislation has always safeguarded the particular characteristics of cooperative banks in their 
various forms. 
Banche popolari are the most important expression of Italy’s cooperative banks in terms of 
assets. A particularly topical debate today concerns the effects that the rapid expansion of 
some of these banche popolari may have had on their inclination to support local economies 
–  in  particular,  the  maintenance  of  close  relationships  with  their  reference  customers 
(households, professionals, artisans, SMEs) – and on management’s incentives.  
The  empirical  evidence  testifies  to  their  close  ties  with  local  economies  and  their  role  in 
financing business initiatives.4 These are reflected in the composition of their lending, with 66 
per  cent  of  the  total  going  to  firms,  against  59  per  cent  for  other  banks.  Comparing  the 
figures for the five largest banking groups headed by banche popolari with those for major

and large banks of comparable size, the gap widens to 10 percentage points (65 against 55 
per cent). 
Strong roots in local economies are a prerequisite for mitigating the difficulties of access to 
credit even in hard times like these. Excluding bad debts and repos, lending to residents by 
banche  popolari  and  other  banks  belonging  to  their  groups  grew  by  6.8  per  cent  in  2008, 
compared with 5.6 per cent for the banking system as a whole. The growth in lending by the 
five  largest  banking  groups  headed  by  banche  popolari  was  in  line  with  that  of  the  other 
major and large banks. By contrast, lending growth was much livelier for the smaller banche 
popolari (13.9 per cent), also by comparison with other banks of comparable size and with 
similar operational characteristics (7.2 per cent) including the mutual banks (10.4 per cent). 
The gap between the growth rates of large and small banche popolari is explained in part by 
the difference in the intensity of their relationship with firms and local communities, since this 
tends to weaken progressively the more banks grow, open up to the market and expand their 
range of operations. When there is a significant development of business relationships and 
areas of activity, including abroad, there can also be a weakening of the control exerted in 
the  form  of  social  pressure  and  in  other  ways  by  the  local  community  (customers  and 
shareholders at one and the same time), so that management’s incentives are less closely 
aligned with the interests of the community where the bank was originally established. 
The support for the economy provided by banche popolari, especially the smaller ones, is a 
major strength of Italy’s banking system. 
However, there are risks that cannot be ignored. An examination of the banking relationships 
of a sample of nearly 50,000 firms surveyed by the Company Accounts Data Service shows 
that the banks that stepped up their lending most sharply in the last year did so in part by 
significantly increasing their exposure to financially fragile firms. The necessary provision of 
support to businesses must be accompanied by an objective assessment of the potential of 
the  projects  undertaken  and  the  medium-term  prospects.  Careful  and  stringent  risk 
management is a sine qua non for credit to continue to flow to where it can safeguard valid 
business initiatives and contribute to the recovery of productive activity.  
Technical indicators 
4.  
The  banche  popolari’s  technical  indicators  –  like  the  main  balance-sheet  aggregates 
analyzed above – point to quite considerable diversification in terms of size and market. 
Capital adequacy ratios show no evidence of any particular difficulty overall. The solvency 
ratio is in line with that of the banking system as a whole; it is higher for the smaller banche 
popolari than for the larger, listed ones. 
Profitability  reflects  these  institutions’  retail  specialization,  involving  broad  territorial 
coverage  through  a  dense  branch  network.  The  ratio  of  operating  costs  to  gross  income, 
which can serve as a proxy for operating efficiency, was 63.8 per cent in June 2008, about 
one percentage point higher than for banks incorporated as public limited companies. This 
indicator improves with the size of the bank: it is better for the listed than for the minor banks 
(63.1  as  against  67.9  per  cent).  ROE  is  lower  for  banche  popolari  than  for  public  limited 
banks (8 and 10 per cent respectively), and again differs within the cooperative group (8.1 
per cent for listed and 7.5 per cent for unlisted institutions). Many cooperative banks, like the 
others, recorded significantly reduced profits in the first three quarters of 2008, as a result of 
the financial turmoil. 
Loan quality is now showing serious effects of the recession, as in the banking system as a 
whole. The non-performing portion of the cooperative banks’ business loans rose by nearly 
half in 2008 to 1.9 per cent, compared with 1.3 per cent at the end of 2007.  
The default rate is rising mostly among the smaller and medium-sized banche popolari and 
those located in the South. 
4 
 BIS Review 40/2009
It  is  hard  to  compare  the  technical  situation  of  cooperative  banks  in  Italy  and  in  the  other 
European countries where they play a significant role, as the data are scanty and lacking in 
uniformity.  Table  6  gives  some  figures;  all  in  all,  there  does  not  appear  to  be  any  great 
difference between the state of Italian and other European cooperative banks. 
Some liquidity problems emerged in conjunction with the tensions in the interbank market. 
The easing of the strains, the issue of new securities that can be posted as collateral (mainly 
through self-securitizations), and the Bank of Italy’s emphatic call for the adoption of more 
sophisticated risk management and liquidity management systems all contributed to a broad 
improvement  in  the  liquidity  profile.  Steps  still  need  to  be  taken  to  develop  sound  cash 
management  strategies  and  to  reinforce  the  organizational  machinery,  so  as  to  achieve 
integrated risk management. 
There  are  some  weak  points  in  organization,  according  to  the  Bank  of  Italy’s  periodic 
examinations.  
Most  of  the  shortcomings  involve  the  functioning  of  corporate  bodies  –  compromised,  in 
some  instances,  by  an  uneven  distribution  of  tasks  and  by  unsatisfactory  internal  debate, 
with  repercussions  on  strategy  and  coordination  –  as  well  as  the  efficacy  of  management 
instruments, the detection and management of risks, and the scope and depth of audits. 
Risk management – including operational, legal and reputational risks – has not always been 
adequate to the cooperative banks’ size and complex business. This applies above all to the 
listed banks, which have been subjected in recent years to growing attention and pressure 
from the market, particularly as regards the effectiveness of their risk control process. 
These anomalies are not generalized, however. The need for improvement is found above all 
where governance systems are not entirely efficient, with rigid, crystallized arrangements and 
insufficient control over management. 
Even where they have not yet affected the other profiles, organizational inadequacies always 
indicate a latent, potential risk. As such, these failings are an important signal that should not 
be neglected, because they impinge sharply upon growth and competitiveness. Like capital 
adequacy, organizational adequacy is a safeguard, the precondition for sound and prudent 
management. 
Governance 
5.  
The  governance  of  the  cooperative  banks  has  been  the  subject  of  lively  debate  in  recent 
years,  with  strongly  differing  opinions  and  points  of  view.  Fundamentally,  the  question  is 
whether these institutions’ traditional model of governance is still suitable today, capable of 
serving the needs of banks that have grown through mergers to considerable size, with an 
increasingly ramified ownership base and open to the capital markets. 
The  main  points  under  debate  have  been  relaxing  the  limits  to  individual  equity  shares, 
strengthening  the  role  of  institutional  investors,  extending  proxy  voting,  and  exploiting  the 
cooperative nature of these intermediaries. 
The cooperative banking model appears to be subject to strain above all among the larger, 
listed  banks,  where  ownership  that  is  open  to  the  market  and  to  institutional  investors 
conflicts  with  rules  that,  though  originally  designed  to  preserve  democratic  participation, 
actually make it hard to contest control, limit the representation of the various shareholder 
components in corporate bodies, and discourage attendance at meetings.  
On the other hand there is no denying the need to preserve intact the features, peculiar to 
banche  popolari,  that  favour  a  development  model  oriented  to  sustaining  the  local 
community. 
The  proper  balance  must  be  struck  between  the  need  to  preserve  the  specificity  of 
cooperation and the need for the model of governance to correspond more closely to these 
BIS Review 40/2009 
 5
institutions’  size  and  market  orientation.  Large  and  complex  institutions,  interested  in  non-
traditional  lines  of  business,  should  consider  the  adoption  of  a  more  open  and  dynamic 
structure of governance, so as to be able to respond promptly to changes in the business 
environment and seize new opportunities, design consistent, comprehensive strategies, and 
ensure effective leadership and coordination. 
Regulation  
the  competitive  context,  without  significantly  altering 
6.  
The legal framework of the cooperative banks in the leading European countries has evolved 
with the development of the legal and economic context: in Spain there are extensive limits 
on  holdings  of  capital,  including  by  persons  other  than  cooperative  members;  in  Germany 
derogations  are  allowed,  in  certain  circumstances,  from  the  one-person-one-vote  rule;  in 
France  multiple  votes  are  permitted  in  proportion  to  the  size  of  the  contribution  of  capital, 
albeit within limits laid down in the bylaws. 
The  evolution  of  the  law  in  Europe  has  also  made  it  possible  to  keep  up  with  the 
development  of 
the  essential 
characteristics of the cooperative model, which is still centred on a democratic structure and 
mutualistic goals. 
In Italy the regulation of banche popolari is still marked by the rigorous interpretation of the 
one-person-one-vote  rule,  the  stringent  legal  provisions  governing  the  limits  to  holdings  of 
capital  (which  can  be  waived  only  for  some  categories  of  institutional  investors),  the  non-
application of the solicitation and collection of proxies, by way of derogation from the general 
rules on listed companies. 
A balanced and pragmatic evolution of the governance arrangements of banche popolari, in 
line  with  the  specific  features  of  each  one,  needs  to  be  carefully  assessed  and  can  be 
implemented  by  means  of  self-regulation,  especially  bylaw  innovations  to  make  better  and 
greater use of some options allowed by the applicable company law. 
An  opportunity  can  be  grasped  when  defining  the  governance  project  provided  for  in  the 
supervisory rules on the organization and corporate governance of banks, which the Bank of 
Italy  issued  in  March  2008.  I  am  referring  to  the  recommendations  aimed  at  ensuring 
adequate representation of the various components of the shareholder base and at activating 
mechanisms that will make it easier for members to take part in meetings. In fact, even in the 
latest shareholders’ meetings (2008) the presence of members of listed banche popolari and 
proxies was very low, less than 5 per cent of those entitled to attend except in a few cases. 
Suitable ways of giving effect to these legal principles include using slate voting systems for 
the election of minority directors and members of the board of auditors; introducing bylaws 
that  reserve  the  appointment  of  a  percentage  of  directors  to  one  or  more  categories  of 
members; broadening the scope for proxies to attend meetings (in compliance with the Civil 
Code); distance voting; and introducing bylaw clauses on the possibility of holding meetings 
in separate locations. 
Other issues that are the focus of debate cannot be resolved through self-regulation and are 
the subject of various legislative initiatives: the broadening of the limits on holdings of capital; 
the assignment of a significant presence of institutional investors in corporate bodies; and the 
strengthening of participation mechanisms. One of the aims underlying these initiatives is to 
increase the instruments for strengthening the capital bases of the banche popolari. 
In  the  present  financial  crisis  it  is  essential  to  remove  every  potential  obstacle  to  capital-
raising measures that should prove necessary. The International Monetary Fund has recently 
6 
 BIS Review 40/2009
highlighted the risks inherent in the present rules on the limits on the possession of holdings 
of capital in banche popolari.5
Members’ participation in meetings must be encouraged with instruments that do not distort 
the essence of the cooperative form and, at the same time, are in line with the regulatory 
evolution  under  way  in  Europe,  partly  as  a  result  of  the  transposition  of  the  directive  on 
shareholders’ rights. 
Conclusions 
7.  
Overall, the world of the cooperative banks is a vital one and able to support the financial 
needs of local areas. There are nonetheless broad differences within the category, in terms 
of size, type of business and openness to the market. 
The  model  of  governance,  which  overall  has  allowed  these  banks  to  respond  to  the 
solicitations of the competitive environment, may not be entirely suitable for large banks with 
a broad and highly diversified shareholder base. 
For such institutions the traditional advantages in terms of customer information and relations 
deriving  from  closeness  and  mutual  control  performed  by  member  clients  are  weakened. 
Without distorting the banca popolare model, organizational and governance arrangements 
need  to  be  found  that  will  compensate  for  the  loss  of  that  competitive  advantage  and  be 
more consistent with the increased complexity of such banks’ operations and their growth in 
size. 
The  financial  market  crisis  that  broke  out  in  the  summer  of  2007  and  grew  worse  after 
September 2008 has led governments, central banks and international institutions to attempt 
to  analyze  its  causes  and  possible  remedies,  with  a  view  to  finding  not  only  immediate 
solutions but also more far-reaching reforms of the financial markets, regulation and controls. 
The  most  authoritative  analyses  conducted  to  date  −  the  report  of  the  Financial  Stability 
Forum  chaired  by  Governor  Mario  Draghi,6  and  the  document  recently  produced  by  the 
Group  of  Thirty7  −  highlight  the  central  role  of  governance  arrangements  and  risk 
management systems for the stability of individual institutions and the financial system as a 
whole. The reforms that legislators and authorities are called upon to carry out, at various 
supranational  and  national  levels,  will  be  based  on  common  rules  and  a  greater  role  for 
organizational and corporate governance variables. 
In this context the banche popolari, in the same way as the banking system as a whole, must 
grasp the opportunity to accelerate the process of adaptation of organizational arrangements 
and  internal  control  systems,  remove  the  problems  and  enhance  these  banks’  role  and 
growth potential. 
The banche popolari should also play a proactive role and demonstrate the ability to evolve 
towards  governance  arrangements  better  suited  to  the  demands  of  stakeholders  and  the 
needs  of  increasingly  competitive  markets,  while  maintaining  the  spirit  of  “participative 
democracy” that underlay the original regulatory framework. 
This is one way to make it possible to perform the traditional function of the economy even 
more  efficiently,  something  that  is  all  the  more  necessary  at  times  of  crisis  such  as  the 
present.
