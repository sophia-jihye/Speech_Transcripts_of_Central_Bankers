José De Gregorio: Chile and the global recession of 2009 
Speech by Mr José De Gregorio, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, at the seminar Los 
temas  del  2009  (Key  Issues  of  2009),  organized  by  the  Instituto  de  Políticas  Públicas 
Expansiva – UDP and Libertad y Desarrollo, Santiago, 20 March 2009. 
I am grateful to Mariana García and Enrique Orellana for their valuable comments and contributions. 
 The  world  is  undergoing  a  major  crisis  and  all  economies,  at  different  degrees,  are  being 
affected by the shrinking output in the developed world. What began as a crisis focused on 
the subprime mortgage market in the United States has swept over the rest of the financial 
systems of the developed countries and is significantly hurting global activity in a variety of 
ways. In fact, a surprising feature of this crisis is its high synchronicity throughout the world. 
Consequently, we are now facing a very complex outlook. It was only last September, when 
the  crisis  was  still  believed  to  be  a  problem  which  would chiefly  affect  developed  financial 
markets, that consensus projections anticipated that the world (measured at market prices) 
would grow by 2.5% during this year. In March, consensus estimates foresee a 1.6% drop in 
global  GDP.  That  is  to  say  that,  in  six  months,  global  growth  projections  for  2009  have 
dropped more than four percentage points (Table 1). 
So,  after  growing  at  an  average  of  near  3%  (at  market  prices)  during  this  decade,  global 
GDP will shrink, something that didn’t happened even during the 1970s’ oil shock or in the 
crisis of the early 1980s. Moreover, global growth as measured at purchasing power parity 
(which gives more weight to developing countries, such as China, which grows faster) will be 
negative this year. This had never happened in the postwar period. 
As  is  obvious,  and  as  we  have  insistently  stressed  since  the  beginning  of  this  period,  our 
economy does not stand aside in this global crisis. Although our financial system has proved 
to be healthy and sound, the crisis has let itself show on the real sector since the final quarter 
of last year. This is a major challenge for macroeconomic policies, since they are the ones 
meant to mitigate the impact of the crisis and, in turn, to open the way to an earlier recovery 
than  the  rest  of  the  world.  Our  economy  is  healthy.  It  has  a  solid  financial  system  and  a 
strong fiscal and foreign reserve position, enabling our country to cope with much harsher 
financing scenarios than the current one and to generate a large scale countercyclical fiscal 
drive.  We  have  a  floating  exchange  rate  system,  which  allows  for  an  easy  adjustment  to 
reduced external demand, and we have no exchange rate straitjacket, so adjustments have 
no restrictions, thereby avoiding harmful consequences for output and employment. Finally, 
prospects  for  inflation  have  brought  about  a  substantial  increase  in  the  monetary  policy 
stimulus. In this way, although we will not be spared the effects of the global crisis, we can 
indeed mitigate their impact. 
Now, I will start out by presenting a short discussion on the relationship between monetary 
easing and the origin of the current global crisis. Then, I will discuss the evolution of inflation 
and output. Next, I will address monetary policy decisions and I will close this presentation 
with some final remarks. 
On the origins of the crisis: monetary policy or financial regulation? 
A lot has been written on the causes of the crisis and, certainly, this is not the time to analyze 
the myriad of factors which led to it.1 But I certainly do want to talk about the interrelationship

Interesting analyses on the origins of the crisis may be found in the articles compiled in section I of Felton and 
Reinhart (2008). For more recent discussions see Brunnermeier (2009), and Diamond and Rajan (2009).

between the performance of the financial system and the abundant liquidity after the interest 
rate cut in the United States following the plunge of the high-tech bubble in 2000. 
Many  blame  the  US  expansionary  monetary  policy  as  the  main  cause  of  the  crisis.  Such 
policy  would  have  caused  the  housing  bubble.  However,  monetary  policy  easing  does  not 
necessarily  bring  about bubbles  in asset  prices  or  even  adjustments  that  may  cause  such 
striking effects as the ones we have witnessed in the United States. Undoubtedly, liquidity 
expansion  was  a  necessary  condition  for  accelerated  credit  growth,  as  it  usually  happens 
during  expansionary  periods.  Current  account  surpluses  of  emerging  countries  and  of 
commodities exporters came on top of this increase in liquidity. Besides, this process took 
place within a context of an aggressive search for yields and financial innovation.  
One could even argue that the mortgage boom in the United States was partly caused by the 
monetary  easing  (Taylor,  2008).  Moreover,  there  is  evidence  that,  in  developed  countries, 
the  larger  the  monetary  policy  excesses,  the  larger  the  mortgage  booms  (Ahrend  et  al., 
2008). Notwithstanding the above, although liquidity is needed to generate credit expansion 
and bubbles in asset prices, by no means can it all by itself generate a crisis such as this 
one. In developing countries, we know very well that when a cyclical downturn is combined 
with a financial crisis, its effects are much deeper and longer. 
Actually, during this same period, economies with the same degree of expansiveness in their 
monetary  policy  and  credit  accelerations,  but  with  sound  financial  systems,  have  not 
increased their vulnerabilities. We ourselves are an example of this (Figure 1). 
Between 2001 and 2004, a strong reduction of the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) took place in 
Chile, and it did not cause a bubble in housing prices nor did it weaken the financial system.2 
The reason why there was no housing price bubble in Chile needs further analysis. Probably, 
a greater elasticity of housing supply contributed to limit the increase in prices (Glaeser et al., 
2008). Maybe, the creation of a bubble was avoided thanks to the way in which mortgage 
loans  and  related  collateral  securities  are  granted.  I  consider  that  a  highly  probable 
hypothesis is that, in view of the income levels prevailing in Chile, which are far below those 
of the developed countries, expansion of consumer loans is more oriented towards financing 
consumption  of  durable  goods  than  houses.  This  issue  remains  open,  but  differences  are 
evident.  Anyway,  this  is  an  area  which  will  have  to  be  particularly  addressed  in  the  future 
(Figure  2).  Besides,  there  were  countries  which  had  a  housing  boom,  with  housing  prices 
soaring  far  above  their  fundamentals,  such  as  Spain  and  Australia,  but  whose  banking 
systems have shown much more resilience.3  
Consequently,  what  happened  in  the  United  States  was  rather  a  growing  fragility  of  its 
financial system, which passed unnoticed to the market and regulators. There was a deficient 
assessment of risks. They mistakenly felt that they were adequately covered and diversified 
by the new “originate and distribute” banking model. Prudential regulation, as well as internal 
policies on risk assessment of financial agents, resulted in a spectacular failure. 
This leads me to another important issue in the recent debate on monetary policy: whether 
monetary  policy  should  take  into  account  asset  prices  when  making  decisions  on  interest 
rates. Although we cannot ignore the option of tightening monetary policy when faced with 
significant  increases  in  asset  prices,  it  is  not  so  certain  that  these  will  give  way  with  an 
increase  in  interest  rates.  This  is  particularly  important  in  emerging  economies,  where  a 
higher  interest  rate  may  raise  incentives  for  carry  trade  and  aggravate  increases  in  asset 
prices.  In  order  to  avoid  financial  imbalances  resulting  from  excessive  and  unjustified 
                                                 
2   We could state that, while the United States had an interest rate lower to that suggested by a Taylor rule (as 
suggested by Taylor, 2008), this was probably not the case in Chile, although I do not know of any evidence 
for or against this hypothesis.  
3   According to Ahrend et al. (2008), between 2000 and 2003, Australia probably also had a rate below the one 
suggested by the Taylor rule.

 BIS Review 41/2009
increases  of  these  prices,  the  first  line  of  defense  should  always  be  macro-prudential 
financial regulation and a thorough assessment of systemic risks, rather than changing the 
monetary policy stance.4 As I have already mentioned, a fast expansion of credit does not 
necessarily mean jeopardizing financial stability. What is indeed harmful, and may certainly 
foster  the  creation  of  bubbles,  is  an  either  implicit  or  explicit  commitment  to  substantially 
ease monetary policy when asset prices fall, unless the financial system is actually believed 
to be under serious risk. 
In short, this abundant liquidity, induced by an expansionary monetary policy and an increase 
in savings among emerging economies, particularly in Asia, has boosted a housing bubble. 
However,  although  it  was  a  component  of  the  imbalances  which  had  built  up  before  the 
outbreak of the crisis, it certainly was not the main cause; rather, such main cause is more 
related  to  the  functioning  of  the  financial  system.  That  is,  with  the  same  path  of  monetary 
policy and global balances of savings and investment, an adequate risk assessment system 
could have averted the crisis or, at least, reduced its very large current scope.  
Evolution of inflation 
During most of 2008, concerns about the global economic scenario were split between how 
to tackle the first effects of the housing bubble burst, mainly affecting the developed world, 
and, how to deal with the significant increase in inflation. Since the beginning of this process, 
in the first half of 2007, we argued that its origin was related to factors which had nothing to 
do with the domestic business cycle, such as prices of food and fuels at international markets 
and  adverse  climatic  conditions  which  favored  major  rises  in  the  cost  of  electric  power. 
During  said  year,  prices  of  non  perishable  foods  rose  by  15%  and  prices  of  fruits  and 
vegetables  rose  by  over  30%,  as  compared  to  annual  2%  average  increases  and  2% 
average  decreases  for  both  categories  in  the  2000-2006  period,  respectively.  Fuel  prices 
rose by 15% in 2007. An essential characteristic of the Chilean economy is that it has very 
few distortions in its price-setting mechanism. This results in increases in international prices 
of  goods  being  transmitted  quickly  to  local  prices,  while  in  many  other  countries  this  is 
avoided by explicit price controls or massive fiscal subsidies5 (Figure 3).  
The most critical phase in this process began in May 2008. After a period with stable monthly 
inflation  figures  in  the  first  quarter  of  last  year,  large  and  unexpected  inflation  rises  began 
taking place. As we then noted, propagation effects were being generated on a higher scale 
than expected and they could prevent inflation from reaching its target of 3% within the policy 
horizon of two years. Inflation expectations also started to rise. Both unwanted second-round 
effects  and  increased  expectations  demanded  a  fast  and  determined  response  by  the 
monetary  policy  aiming  at  mainstreaming  the  inflation  path  to  reach  its  target.  This  was 
essential to prevent inflationary persistence from generating a wage/price spiral which would 
have been harder to revert, if no early measures were adopted. In fact, output costs would 
have been even harsher, if inflation had been allowed to persist.  
But the world has changed, and it has done so in a radical way. What was expected to be a 
mere  global  economic  slowdown,  gradually 
in  output. 
Consequently,  commodities’  prices  began  to  plunge  with  unusual  strength.  After  having 
reached almost 150 dollars halfway through 2008, the oil barrel tumbled down to 40 dollars in 
December.  Something  similar  happened  with  copper,  other  minerals,  grain,  etc.  The 
response of inflation did not take long to arrive on the scene. Since the inflation peak of last 
year,  Chile  is  one  of  the  countries  where  inflation  has  dropped  most  sharply.6  Inflation

expectations  have  also  shown  major  adjustments  in  the  face  of  this  new  global  scenario 
(Figure 4).  
However, the main issue in the most likely scenario, is the effect on inflationary pressures of 
the increase in output gaps and the decrease in international commodities’ prices resulting 
from  the  global  recession.  Its  effects  on  the  inflation  forecasts  for  the  next  two  years  are 
highly  relevant  and  have  enabled  the  application  of  countercyclical  policies.  The  anti-
inflationary commitment ensuing from monetary policy conduct based on a flexible inflation 
targeting  regime  has  paved  the  way  for  an  important  and  unprecedented  adjustment  of 
monetary  policy.  Likewise,  for  monetary  policy  to  be  effective,  rate  changes  must  be 
transmitted to the entire yield curve, and this is achieved by implementing a monetary policy 
based on a credible anchor. In fact, since the Central Bank announced a downward bias of 
the MPR, the market has started to include this monetary easing at all horizons. Moreover, 
we  can  see  today  that  the  application  of  monetary  easing  is  also  reaching  lending  rates 
(Becerra et al., 2009), and this should still be so after last week's drop (Figure 5). 
Less output in Chile   
As  I  have  already  mentioned,  a  lower  output  level  bears  important  consequences  on  the 
inflationary outlook. To understand this, it is useful to define three distinct factors:  
• 
• 
• 
I would like to refer to each of these three factors: 
The domestic business cycle. 
Real and financial impacts of the international crisis. 
Global confidence crisis. 
The domestic business cycle 
(i) 
Domestic demand has grown rapidly in the past few years. This did not translate completely 
into a higher output level, since part of it diverged towards imported goods. During the 2004-
2007  period,  the  average  annual  growth  rate  of  domestic  demand  was  8.1%,  i.e.,  2.9 
percentage  points  over  output.  During  this  same  period,  average  annual  growth  in  private 
consumption was 7.2%. Investment grew by a 12.1% annual average, thereby doubling the 
growth of output, and this resulted in the highest ever investment rates in our history. This 
process  had  to  tone  down  necessarily,  as  it  gradually  occurred  during  2008  (Figure  6).  A 
certain degree of bunching of individual decisions on consumption and investment is usually 
seen,  particularly  when  these  have  risen  in  response  to  common  financial  and  global 
conditions. Something similar should happen in periods of weaknesses.  
Therefore,  this  cycle  cannot  be  expected  to  disappear  or  to  be  completely  stabilized  by 
monetary policy, which is in turn not advisable. Macroeconomic policies should only aspire to 
smooth out any fluctuations. Monetary policy, committed to price stability, can stabilize both 
inflation and the business cycle. 
Halfway  into  last  year,  it  was  believed  that  a  more  restrictive  monetary  policy  would 
contribute to reduce inflationary pressures in an international scenario showing less growth, 
but not a crisis. This was based upon the belief that, although the shock which had given rise 
to  the  increase  in  inflation  was  external,  favoring  a  deceleration  of  internal  demand  would 
mitigate  its  propagation  to  other  prices,  which  had  already  happened  with  the  inflation 
records  of  part  of  the  second  and  third  quarter  of  2008.  However,  a  massive  international 
crisis  came  on  top  of  the  natural  evolution  of  the  domestic  cycle  under  a  more  restrictive 
monetary policy. This crisis, as we can see it today, is bearing a greater impact on output 
than we expected and than the one needed to bring inflation to target; and this has resulted 
in a change of sign of monetary policy aimed at mitigating the negative external impulse.

 BIS Review 41/2009
Real and financial impact of the international crisis 
(ii)  
The global economic crisis has two kinds of domestic impacts. The first one is financial. Risk 
premiums  rise  and  capital  flows  fall.  As  evidenced  by  the  information  available  so  far,  we 
have not had any problems with external financing resources; however, the Central Bank has 
assured that, should such problems come up, it will provide any necessary liquidity in dollars 
and pesos for the financial system to continue providing credit adequately. The average cost 
of  foreign  financing  has  dropped,  although  for  some  companies  it  has  risen,  as  a 
consequence of greater global uncertainty and of a less fluid operation of the international 
financial markets (Figure 7). 
This  crisis  has  also  had  significant  implications  in  the  real  sector.  Even  though  the  world 
demand  reduction  affects  all  countries,  the  most  direct  impact  has  been  borne  by  the 
economies  driven  by  exports  of  manufactured  products  –  particularly  machinery  and 
equipment  –  to  developed  countries  (Figure  8).  Some  countries,  such  as  Germany  and 
Japan, have witnessed a severe effect on their output, although they initially were in a much 
better position than was the United States.  
Therefore, although a decline in investment and in durable consumption in the world has a 
more direct impact on exporting industrial economies, it also results in declines in exports of 
countries  which  produce  intermediate  and  basic  goods,  including  Chile.  However,  our 
country should not be too affected thanks to a characteristic that has always been pointed 
out as a hindrance to our development – with which I agree – : the low value added, or the 
low human capital content, of our exports. Chilean exports are closer to being commodities, 
which  face  relatively  abundant  demands.  There  will  always  be  a  price  at  which  to  export. 
Thus, the greater impact is a decrease in the prices of our exports, since quantity limitations 
are smaller (Figure 9). Although lower prices push producers towards reducing their supply, 
with the ensuing implications on employment, output and investment, it is very different from 
what happens, for example, to producers of intermediate goods, specific for the automotive 
industry.  Their  demand  falls  dramatically  and  all  their  already  started  production  piles  up 
unsold. And this leads to a subsequent production standstill. This explains the intensity with 
which the crisis is impacting the more industrialized economies of Asia.  
To sum up, the international crisis is bearing real effects on our output, specifically on our 
exports, but its reach in Chile is more limited than the effect on other economies which are 
based on manufacturing exports. 
Global confidence crisis 
(iii) 
As  from  last  September,  global  confidence  plummeted  throughout  the  world  (Figure  10). 
Individuals  as  well  as  companies  adopted  a  “wait-and-see”  attitude  in  view  of  the  high 
uncertainty  and  deterioration  of  the  economic  outlook.  As  it  is  likely  to  happen  in  more 
uncertain scenarios – and, in this case, extremely uncertain – , individuals stop consuming 
abruptly  and  companies  dramatically  revise  their  investment  and  production  plans. 
Therefore,  propagation  of  the  financial  crisis  effects  was  worsened  by  a  massive  loss  of 
confidence.  These  losses  of  confidence  may  lead  to  recessions  which  are  self-fulfilling 
prophecies.  People  say:  “things  are  looking  down,  so  we'd  better  not  spend,”  so  nobody 
spends, and it is this same public who, some time later, say: “I told you, things were looking 
down.” However, in this case, the loss of confidence has been definitely well-grounded on 
the  relentless  crisis  the  world  is  currently  undergoing,  but  whose  effects  are  being  in  turn 
worsened by this same loss of confidence.  
Confidence  crises  are  hard  to  fight  by  using  just  traditional  tools  of  economic  policy. 
Confidence indicators of households and companies should bounce back up as months go 
by,  as  a  result  of  sustainable  and  credible  expansionary  macroeconomic  policies  and 
objective communication about reality. In Chile, particularly, we are able to face this negative 
international scenario, thanks to our healthy economy and expansionary policies.

In  our  January  monetary  policy  report  (IPoM),  we  forecasted  that,  in  the  most  probable 
scenario, the Chilean economy would grow between 2 and 3% this year. In such scenario, it 
was estimated that the GDP of our trade partners would grow 0.4%; however, after all the 
past months’ corrections, this figure is now estimated to have turned into a more than 1% 
decrease. As I said at the beginning, this is a major change of scenario, which will certainly 
affect the growth projections of our economy. Although every month we carry out exercises 
in  which  we  try  to  measure  the  impact  of  macroeconomic  changes  on  our  own  baseline 
scenario, we do not yet have a final and complete revision of such scenario which may allow 
us  to  estimate,  with  a  reasonable  degree  of  certainty,  the  expected  growth  for  2009. 
However,  it  is  not  hard  to  guess  that  such  growth  shall  be  below  the  2-3%  range  we 
estimated  in  January.  The  exact  figure  remains  to  be  seen.  Anyway,  a  useful  background 
could  be  the  change  in  the  projections  of  the  analysts  who  answered  the  Economic 
Expectations Survey carried out by the Bank or the last issue of Consensus Forecasts. In 
these projections, the expected growth for this year went, respectively, from 2% and 1.9% in 
December to 0.2% and 0.0% in March.  
Accumulation of reserves. 
Supply of peso and dollar liquidity.  
Monetary easing. 
Actions taken by the Central Bank during the crisis 
Since  the  beginning  of  the  crisis,  halfway  through  2007,  the  actions  taken  by  the  Central 
Bank have been focused on three fields: 
• 
• 
• 
In the first half of last year there was an unusual strengthening of the peso, within a context 
in  which  there  were  great  risks  of  deterioration  of  the  international  financial  environment, 
such  as  it  actually  happened.  At  the  same  time,  inflationary  pressures  had  been  relatively 
limited during the first quarter. In this scenario, the Bank’s Board decided to strengthen our 
international liquidity position by accumulating 8 billion dollars over an eight-month period. In 
order  to  preserve  independence  of  monetary  policy,  that  is,  not  to  subordinate  it  to  the 
foreign exchange policy nor to a specific value of the exchange rate, the chosen method was 
a pre-announced and mechanical daily purchase of 50 million dollars. In fact, the degree of 
independence was such that, later on, the interest rate could be raised when faced with a 
more complex inflationary scenario, without the need for stopping intervention. 
Halfway through September, liquidity tensions grew substantially around the world, as well as 
in Chile. This led the Board to bring the reserve purchase program to an end when almost 6 
billion  dollars  had  been  accumulated,  and  the  country  had  reached  quite  a  comfortable 
international liquidity position, which would enable us to mitigate any possible sudden stop of 
capital flows. 
Besides, in view of the worsening of liquidity problems, the Bank announced the supply of 
liquidity in pesos and dollars through repos and swaps. Later on, in October, the range of 
eligible collaterals was broadened and the dollar swap program was extended for six months. 
Then, in December, an extension for all of 2009 was announced for the repos and swaps 
program, and the range of eligible collaterals was broadened further. The purpose of these 
measures was to align market rates with the Monetary Policy Rate and to alleviate foreign 
currency liquidity tensions. Both objectives have been accomplished, and the scarce demand 
for dollars through swap transactions show that our economy still has a fluid access to the 
international  financial  markets.  In  all  cases,  and  to  ensure  adequate  liquidity,  instruments 
designed last year will continue to be in force throughout this year and, if necessary, they will 
be extended in order to ensure the proper operation of the financial system, so that it may be 
able to play its role of channeling credit to the non-financial private sector.

 BIS Review 41/2009
It  is  important  to  highlight  that,  for  mechanisms  of  monetary  policy  transmission  to  work 
correctly, the money market must be aligned with the MPR. There is no gain in reducing the 
interest rate if such reduction is not transmitted to the rest of the market. Therefore, when the 
crisis worsened, the first task was to ease liquidity pressures. 
The  unfolding  of  the  crisis  and  its  consequent  effects  on  inflation  forecasts  brought  the 
possibility for a monetary easing. Said monetary easing has had a significant extent when 
compared to our past experiences and to what has been done by other central banks. During 
the first quarter, the MPR was reduced by 600 base points – from 8.25% to 2.25%. 
It  is  important  to  note  once  again  that  our  economy  has  not  suffered  any  of  the  problems 
undergone  by  other  economies  in  their  financial  systems.  Therefore,  monetary  easing  in 
Chile  does  not  seek  to  re-establish  the  operation  of  credit,  as  it  may  happen  elsewhere; 
rather,  it  has  been  totally  consistent  with  the  inflationary  outlook.  This  is  the  result  of  a 
credible inflation targeting scheme, which acted consistently with its objective when inflation 
threatened  to  be  undesirably  high,  and  is  doing  so  with  the  same  consistency  now,  when 
inflation threatens to be undesirably low. 
Although reductions in the interest rate have had an unprecedented intensity, they have been 
consistent  with  the  prevailing  circumstances.  They  are  intended  to  mitigate  the  risks  of  a 
negative impact on the Chilean economy of a lengthy deterioration of the global economy, 
and  this  has  caused  the  MPR  to  be  adjusted  more  rapidly,  instead  of  being  gradually 
adjusted  as  before.  Besides,  in  view  of  the  recent  evidence,  a  quick  adjustment  could 
accelerate its transmission to market rates, beyond what the decrease in itself would imply, 
and this could have also been made easier through the removal of the stamp tax. In this way, 
as we have already said in our last meeting’s statement, we have moved the MPR closer to a 
level which we consider is better aligned with the current macroeconomic scenario and the 
risks we are being faced with. However, it is still too early to sing our praises, since events 
are happening so fast that we cannot rest on the work we have done so far. Nevertheless, as 
we also mentioned in said release, any potential downward adjustments to the MPR will be 
similar in size and frequency to our historical patterns, which are far from what we have been 
witnessing  in  the  last  quarter.  This  is  mainly  because  it  is  necessary  to  give  time  to  the 
transmission  mechanisms  of  the  monetary  policy  to  work,  so  that  the  consequences  of 
decisions already made can be seen in practice.  
Final remarks 
I would like to end with some lessons about monetary policy conduct which have stemmed 
from the great inflation rise that has taken place since mid-2007, into our current international 
situation. 
In the first place, many times it had been noted that Chile was one of the countries where the 
highest increase in inflation – more than tripling the target – was observed, with the interest 
rate rising less than in other economies with lower inflationary pressures. As I have already 
argued,  our  policy  response  was  completely  consistent  with  a  flexible  monetary  policy 
framework.  As  the  price  shock  became  stronger  and  more  persistent,  monetary  policy 
became  more  restrictive.  This  same  flexibility  in  managing  monetary  policy  enables  us  to 
react  quickly  to  the  strong  deterioration  of  the  external  conditions  today.  Fortunately,  our 
economy  is  solid  enough  to  absorb  significant  changes  in  the  course  of  monetary  policy, 
without this being a threat to stability. 
In  the  second  place,  inflationary  dynamics  are  highly  complex  and  cannot  be  linearly 
mechanized  based  on  historical  evidence.  Early 
inflation  was 
consolidating  at  low  levels,  we  saw  that  persistence  of  inflation  had  dropped  substantially, 
thereby reducing the impact of propagation via indexation and other phenomena that were 
characteristic  of  our  high-inflation  past  (García  and  Valdés,  2005).  When  inflation 
reappeared, persistence did so too, and many analysts then thought that it would stay with 
this  decade,  when

us  for  a  long  time,  since  they  believed  indexation  had  revived  strongly.  I  do  not  wish  to 
discard  this  reasoning,  but  we  have  learned  a  lesson  here,  which  should  be  confirmed  in 
future research, that persistence is not stable, highly non-linear, and it greatly depends on 
the global context. This is particularly valid in a small and quite open market economy.7  
Finally, I would like to make a reflection on the communicational challenge we are now faced 
with. Not only must we apply the right policies, but also put them in the right context. I have 
described  a  highly  adverse  global  outlook,  and  some  could  have  reservations  about  an 
authority  doing  this,  since  it  could  generate  some  degree  of  pessimism.  Quite  on  the 
contrary, I believe that one must talk realistically and, besides, if we ignore how serious the 
global situation is, it would mean that we don’t have a clue to what is really going on. Trust is 
gained with sincerity and adequate policies for the current times. There is a second element 
that enables me to talk freely and bluntly: the conviction that our economy is healthy and very 
well prepared to face this present condition, which is something that did not happen in any of 
the former external crises. Monetary and fiscal policies are being implemented with a high 
degree of expansiveness, so as to limit any effects of the current international crisis as much 
as possible. This is, undoubtedly, very good news. 
Thank you very much.

7   We could argue that, as it was done when inflation rose, it was the result of the domestic demand cycle which, 
after  growing  fast,  slowed  down  dramatically.  However,  slowdown  of  demand  is  happening  throughout  the 
world and a decrease in inflation is observed at a much higher level in Chile. Therefore, we are witnessing 
structural factors which go beyond changes in demand.
