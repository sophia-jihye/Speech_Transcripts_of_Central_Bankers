Svante Öberg: Monetary policy and the elusive resource utilisation 
Speech  by  Mr  Svante  Öberg,  First  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at 
Handelsbanken, Stockholm, 25 May 2009. 
The  original  speech,  which  contains  various  links  to  the  documents  mentioned,  can  be  found  on  the  Sveriges 
Riksbank’s website.  
 Resource  utilisation  is  falling  rapidly  and  is  unusually  low.  But  it  is  difficult  to  determine 
exactly  how  low  it  is.  And  it  is  difficult  to  ascertain  what  consequences  the  low  resource 
utilisation  will  have  for  inflation  and  monetary  policy.  These  are  the  questions  I  intend  to 
discuss in my speech today. 
I  have  divided  my  speech  into  four  parts.  I  shall  begin  by  discussing  the  importance  of 
resource utilisation for monetary policy and pointing out the differences as to how the targets 
for  inflation  and  resource  utilisation  can  be  expressed.  After  that  I  shall  discuss  different 
measures  of  resource  utilisation.  I  shall  go  on  to  describe  monetary  policy  and  resource 
utilisation at present and I shall conclude with a few summarising comments. 
I  wish  to  make  clear  from  the  start  that  I  will  not  make  any  new  assessment  today  of  the 
appropriate direction for monetary policy in relation to the Monetary Policy Update that was 
published  at  the  end  of  April.  I  also  want  to  point  out  that  the  picture  I  paint  of  resource 
utilisation and monetary policy here is not necessarily shared completely by my colleagues 
on the Executive Board of the Riksbank. 
Resource utilisation is important for monetary policy 
When we members of the Executive Board make decisions on monetary policy we take into 
account  both  inflation  and  resource  utilisation.  Our  monetary  policy  is  normally  aimed  at 
attaining the inflation target of two per cent a couple of years ahead. If we are also able to 
support economic policy in general without neglecting the inflation target, then we do so. At 
present  this  means  that  we  can  also  use  monetary  policy  to  try  to  mitigate  the  current 
economic recession. 
It is fairly easy to follow inflation. Inflation is measured by means of a well-established and 
relatively uncontroversial instrument, the annual change in the consumer price index – the 
CPI. Of course, there are other measures of inflation that we regularly follow, such as the 
CPI with a fixed interest rate – the CPIF, the CPI with a fixed interest rate excluding energy, 
the  EU-harmonised  measure  HICP,  and  a  number  of  measures  of  what  is  known  as 
underlying inflation. But we always clearly state that it is the CPI that is our target variable. 
We only use the other inflation measures to analyse and better understand developments in 
inflation. 
However,  it  is  much  more  difficult  to  determine  the  degree  of  resource  utilisation.  On  a 
general  level,  resource  utilisation  refers  to  how  much  of  the  available  labour  and  capital 
assets are used. In practice, one tries to measure it in several different ways. For example, 
GDP in relation to trend GDP, employment ratio, unemployment and capacity utilisation. I will 
take up a number of these measures a little later on. 
It is also fairly simple to see how inflation relates to the set target, but it is much more difficult 
to gain an impression of what the target for resource utilisation should be. We express the 
inflation target as being that the annual change in the CPI should be two per cent, but we do 
not have an equally well-defined target for resource utilisation. Instead, we usually say that 
we endeavour to reduce the fluctuations in the real economy.

Resource  utilisation  is  important  in  a  monetary  policy  context  for  two  reasons.  Firstly,  it  is 
related  to  important  targets  in  economic  policy,  such  as  a  high  GDP,  a  high  level  of 
employment  and  low  unemployment.  The  economic  recession  we  are  now  experiencing 
means that GDP will fall by around 4.5 per cent this year, that employment will fall by almost 
300,000 persons in three years, and that unemployment will reach approximately 11 per cent 
in  two  years’  time,  all  according  to  our  most  recent  forecasts  in  April.  The  expansionary 
monetary policy we are now conducting is thus partly motivated by an aim to limit the depth 
of the recession. 
Secondly,  resource  utilisation  is  important  because  it  is  an  indicator  of  future  inflationary 
pressures.  But  a  difficult  question  is  how  resource  utilisation  co-varies  with  inflation.  My 
impression is that the connection between resource utilisation and inflation has been weaker 
over  the  past  two  decades  than  it  was  before.  But  the  connection  probably  still  remains, 
albeit in a weaker form. This means that in our monetary policy we also have to take into 
account  what  effects  resource  utilisation  has  on  inflation  in  the  slightly  longer  term.  I  will 
return to this issue later on.  
Different measures of resource utilisation 
There is no clear-cut means of defining resource utilisation, nor of measuring it. When one 
tries to measure resource utilisation one is faced with different alternatives. For example, one 
can draw conclusions regarding resource utilisation in the economy by comparing output or 
employment with a trend, normal or ideal level. Examples of this approach include the GDP 
gap, the employment gap and the flexprice gap. Another alternative with regard to measuring 
resource  utilisation  is  to  use  as  a  base  responses  to  direct  questions  put  to  companies 
regarding, for instance, their utilisation of labour and capital. Both of these approaches have 
inherent difficulties. In the first case, one must relate actual output or employment to a trend, 
normal or ideal level that is difficult to determine, and in the second case one must rely on 
the companies’ own assessments of their resource utilisation.  
GDP gap 
A common means of measuring resource utilisation is to relate actual GDP to a long-term or 
trend  level  of  GDP.  This  GDP  level  is  also  often  called  potential  GDP,  despite  the  word 
potential  implying  that  GDP  cannot  be  greater  than  this  level.  The  measure  obtained  by 
relating actual GDP to potential GDP – what is known as a GDP gap – has the advantage of 
being easy to understand. It is also close to a number of concepts that are used in monetary 
policy  analysis.  The  so-called  Taylor  rule  often  used  to  describe  how  monetary  policy  is 
conducted contains such a GDP gap. When one talks about the target for monetary policy 
being to minimise deviations in inflation from the target and fluctuations in the real economy, 
the latter is often illustrated with a GDP gap.  
But it is not entirely clear how one should measure the long-term or trend level of GDP. A 
common method for determining this GDP level is to use some statistical tool to find a trend 
in the available GDP statistics. The Hodrick-Prescott filter, or HP filter, is one such tool. This 
filter is used to obtain an HP trend which is a cross between a linear trend and the uneven 
curve  showing  the  actual  GDP  outcome.  Such  HP  trends  are  regularly  reported  in  the 
Riksbank's Monetary Policy Reports.  
Figure  1  shows  actual  GDP,  potential  GDP  measured  as  an  HP  trend  and  the  GDP  gap, 
which  is  the  difference  between  these.  The  actual  GDP  gap  is  stated  as  a  percentage  of 
GDP, measured on the right-hand scale, and in the figure this becomes a form of enlarged 
image of the difference between actual and potential GDP. The dotted parts of the curves 
represent the Riksbank’s forecasts from the April Monetary Policy Update. One can draw the 
conclusion  from  this  figure  that  resource  utilisation  in  terms  of  the  GDP  gap  has  recently 
2 
 BIS Review 66/2009
fallen below the normal level and that we are assuming that it will remain negative over the 
coming years. 
There are both advantages and disadvantages in measuring resource utilisation with the aid 
of the GDP gap. One advantage is that this method does not require any other information 
than historical GDP data. One disadvantage is that when using this method it is difficult to 
estimate the trend and thereby the GDP gap at the end of the time series and it is precisely 
the GDP gap at the end of the series that is the most interesting part. This problem becomes 
particularly troublesome in a recession like the current one. This is because experiences of 
previous recessions imply that some of the output capacity that is lost after a fall in resource 
utilisation  never  returns  when  the  upturn  comes.  Quite  simply,  it  is  easier  to  wind  up 
companies  than  to  build  them  up.  To  some  extent  these  problems  are  dealt  with  in  the 
Riksbank’s calculations, in that the calculation of the trend level of GDP is affected by the 
outcomes  for  years  of  weak  GDP  growth  and  by  parts  of  the  fall  in  productivity  being 
assumed to be permanent. 
Another consequence of using HP filters to find the trend-based GDP gap is that one risks 
interpreting  an  increase  in  growth  that  is  due  to  a  temporary  rise  in  productivity  as  an 
increase in resource utilisation. But in a situation with sticky prices an increase in productivity 
may actually lead to a decline in resource utilisation as the increase in productivity makes it 
possible to use fewer resources to produce the same volume as before. If we were in such a 
case to use a trend-based output gap as a base, there is a risk that monetary policy would 
become contractionary when it needed to be expansionary. 
The  difficulty  with  the  trend-adjustment  method  is  thus  to  distinguish  from  current 
developments what constitutes changes in the trend and what are deviations from the trend, 
that is, changes in resource utilisation. 
Flexprice gap 
A theoretically interesting measure of resource utilisation that has gained increased attention 
in  the  research  on  monetary  policy  is  the  so-called  flexprice  gap.  This  is  a  measure  that 
relates  actual  output  to  potential  output  in  an  economy  with  entirely  flexible  prices  and 
wages.  
The advantage of this measure is that it has a well-defined theoretical base. To calculate the 
flexprice gap one tries to determine the level of output that would be attained without some of 
the imperfections that the real economy suffers from. One can, for instance, use as a base a 
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of the New Keynesian type, where the primary 
reason for inefficient resource utilisation is that prices and wages are slow to adjust to new 
circumstances. Such a model makes it possible to obtain a measure of the effective output 
that would arise if both prices and wages were entirely flexible – the flexprice output. The 
difference between actual output and the calculated flexprice output is the flexprice gap. If 
one  has  a  good  model  for  calculating  the  flexprice  gap,  one  avoids  the  problems  with  the 
trend-based measure of managing disruptions caused by productivity shocks.1  
However, this measure also has disadvantages. The results of the calculations are sensitive 
to the exact design of the model. Nor is it as easy to interpret these results, which is partly 
because the flexprice output varies more over time than the measure of the trend in GDP

production can be defined and measured, see Palmqvist, S. (2007), “Flexible inflation targeting – how should

usually used. The flexprice gap is therefore not yet used in practice in our monetary policy 
work.2  
Nevertheless,  I  can  show  how  it  looks  when  it  is  calculated  using  the  Riksbank’s  macro 
model RAMSES.3 Figure 2 shows that the flexprice gap occasionally differs somewhat from 
the GDP gap. The fluctuations in the flexprice gap have in general been slightly less, which is 
partly because the flexprice gap only captures the fluctuations in GDP that can be explained 
by  sticky  prices  and  wages.  However,  the  flexprice  gap  and  the  GDP  gap  do  provide  a 
uniform  picture  of  the  recent  development  towards  an  excessively  low  level  of  resource 
utilisation  in  the  economy.  The  fact  that  the  flexprice  gap  is  now  negative  is  currently 
interpreted to mean that output is now lower than it would have been if prices and wages had 
adjusted to the changes that have recently affected the economy. 
Labour market gaps 
Another  type  of  measure  focuses  on  utilisation  of  labour.  These  are  based  on  Statistics 
Sweden’s  labour  force  surveys  and  on  the  National  Accounts.  Figure  3  shows  two  such 
measures:  unemployment  and  the  employment  rate,  that  is,  what  percentage  of  the 
population of working age is employed. The curves provide a consistent picture of changes in 
resource  utilisation  over  time.  At  the  same  time,  they  show  that  the  crisis  of  the  1990s 
permanently raised unemployment and reduced the employment rate. This makes it difficult 
to  determine  what  is  a  long-term  sustainable  level  for  resource  utilisation  in  the  labour 
market. 
From  the  perspective  of  general  politics,  it  is  normally  regarded  as  an  advantage  if 
employment is high and unemployment is low. But in a monetary policy perspective it may be 
a  problem  if  resource  utilisation  is  so  high  that  inflation  risks  overshooting  the  target.  If 
resource utilisation is so low that inflation risks undershooting the target, the general political 
and monetary policy implications coincide. 
An  estimate  of  what  level  of  employment  can  be  regarded  as  normal  can  be  obtained  by 
calculating an HP-based trend similar to that used for calculating the GDP gap. This can be 
considered  to  represent  a  normal  situation  in  the  labour  market,  without  temporary 
disruptions  that  affect  the  supply  of  or  demand  for  labour.  Gaps  that  measure  the  actual 
deviation  in  employment  from  the  normal  level,  either  in  the  number  of  persons  or  in  the 
number  of  hours  worked,  are  called  labour  market  gaps.  Figure  4  shows  two  such  labour 
market-based gaps. 
Capacity utilisation 
But  neither  the  number  of  persons  employed  nor  the  number  of  hours  worked  provides  a 
really good picture of resource utilisation. During a severe cutback in output such as in the 
current  economic  situation,  companies  tend  to  a  large  extent  to  retain  their  employees, 
although they have less work for them to do. To obtain a better picture of resource utilisation 
the labour market statistics need to be supplemented with data from, for instance, Statistics

Sweden’s  data  on  capacity  utilisation  in  industry  and  the  National  Institute  of  Economic 
Research’s Economic Tendency Survey. 
Figure 5 shows capacity utilisation in industry as reported by the companies. According to 
figures from Statistics Sweden, capacity utilisation in industry reached a peak of around 91 
per cent in the first quarter of 2007, and has since fallen to around 78 per cent in the first 
quarter  of  2009.  According  to  the  National  Institute  of  Economic  Research’s  Economic 
Tendency  Survey,  capacity  utilisation  in  industry  during  the  same  period  has  fallen  from 
around 88 per cent to around 72 per cent. In both cases a large fall is reported. But these 
data  concern  only  a  small  percentage  of  the  economy  and  do  not  in  general  provide  the 
same picture as, for instance, the GDP gap also shown in the Figure. 
Aggregate measure of resource utilisation 
At the Riksbank we have also produced an aggregate measure of resource utilisation. But 
this is not intended to replace all other measures; it will be used as a generic complement to 
the other measures. 
The aggregate measure of resource utilisation has been produced with the aid of a principal 
component analysis. This is a statistical method that extracts the common component from a 
large amount of data. Figure 6 shows the results of one such analysis, where around thirty 
labour  market  and  business  tendency  indicators  have  been  used  to  extract  a  common 
component  for  resource  utilisation.  To  be  comparable  to  the  traditional,  trend-related 
measures  of  resource  utilisation  the  indicator  has  been  normalised  so  that  its  standard 
deviation coincides with that of the GDP gap. 
The  figure  illustrates  two  important  conditions.  Firstly,  the  aggregate  measure  of  resource 
utilisation  follows  the  GDP  gap  very  well.  Secondly,  the  labour  market  gap  lags  a  few 
quarters behind both the resource utilisation indicator and the GDP gaps.  
One disadvantage of this measure is that it is not suitable for forecasts of resource utilisation 
short of making forecasts of all of the indicators included. As the measure coincides so well 
with  the  GDP  gap,  I  believe  that  it  provides  some  support  for  the  argument  that  GDP 
forecasts are a good indicator of how resource utilisation will develop in the future, however 
with some reservations, and I will return to these later.  
Which measure of resource utilisation is best? 
My conclusions are firstly, that the various measures of resource utilisation provide a similar 
picture of the economic cycles. However, the more precise picture varies quite substantially 
between the measures.  Each individual measure offers some extra piece of information in 
addition to what is contained in the other measures. But this does not prevent it from being 
very useful to continue developing aggregate measures of resource utilisation. 
Secondly,  all  of  the  measures  described  show  that  resource  utilisation  has  recently  fallen 
rapidly.  The  GDP  gap,  the  flexprice  gap  and  the  indicator  that  is  intended  to  provide  an 
aggregate measure of resource utilisation show that resource utilisation is already below the 
normal level. The labour market gaps are lagging behind, but will, according to our current 
forecast, soon point to labour force use of below normal levels. 
The  GDP  gap  that  is  based  on  an  HP  trend  for  GDP  indicates  that  resource  utilisation  is 
falling  by  around  10  percentage  points  from  the  peak  level  in  2007  to  a  trough  in  2010. 
Although we have used a gradually declining output capacity as a basis for the calculation of 
the HP trend, this fall in the GDP gap probably gives an exaggerated picture of the fall in 
resource utilisation during the period as the potential output level ought to have fallen more 
than  is  reflected  in  the  HP  trend.  The  deeper  and  longer  the  economic  recession  is,  the 
larger  the  output  capacity  that  can  be  expected  to  disappear.  The  resource  utilisation 
indicator shows the same picture as the GDP gap, but there are no forecasts for this. 
BIS Review 66/2009

The employment rate and unemployment will deteriorate by around 5 percentage points from 
2008 to 2011 according to the forecast we made in April. These measures, which are not 
related  to  any  normal  level,  show  a  slightly  smaller,  but  similar,  deterioration  in  resource 
utilisation to that described by the hours gap and the employment gap. But for these two later 
measures it is also a question of the deeper and more prolonged the recession is, the greater 
the part of the fall in employment and hours that will be interpreted as a weakening in the 
labour market trend that will not disappear in the next economic upturn. In this case we will 
have what is usually termed persistence in unemployment, a phenomenon that has proved 
common in many countries.  
To  illustrate  the  significance  of  the  recession  for  the  calculations  of  the  HP  trend  and  the 
trend  gap,  one  can  compare  the  calculations  of  the  future  trend  levels  of  GDP  and 
employment  in  the  calculations  made  in  October  2008  and  April  2009.  The  trend  level  for 
GDP  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2011  is  approximately  5  per  cent  lower  in  the  more  recent 
calculations  and  the  trend  level  for  employment  is  approximately  2.5  per  cent  lower.  The 
recession is thus assumed to have lowered the potential level of GDP and employment and 
thus also reduced the GDP and employment gaps.  
Monetary policy and resource utilisation in the current situation 
At  the  most  recent  monetary  policy  meeting  at  the  end  of  April  we  made  a  substantial 
downward  revision  to  the  forecast  for  GDP  growth  in  the  world  in  relation  to  the  February 
forecast. My assessment was then that our main scenario, with a decline in GDP in the world 
of  around  1  per  cent  this  year  and  an  increase  of  just  over  2  per  cent  next  year  was 
reasonable. But at the same time I considered that there was a risk that the recession would 
even be deeper and more protracted than we predicted. My reasoning was based on the fact 
that  recessions  that  arise  as  a  consequence  of  financial  crises  and  recessions  that  are 
synchronised between several countries are normally followed by slow recoveries. 
Sweden was in a severe recession in April and we are still. We were assuming a fall in GDP 
of  around  4.5  per  cent  this  year  and  a  weak  recovery  next  year.  As  in  the  case  of 
international developments, my assessment was that on balance the predominant risks were 
that the recession could be deeper and more prolonged. CPI inflation was expected to be 
negative  this  year,  but  underlying  CPI  inflation  with  a  fixed  interest  rate,  the  CPIF,  was 
expected to be close to 2 per cent throughout the entire forecast period. In my opinion, there 
was  no  reason  to  worry  about  deflation  and  no  reason  to  worry  about  high  inflation.  We 
decided to cut the policy rate to 0.5 per cent. 
Today  I  would  like  to  take  up  two  questions  in  the  current  situation  that  are  linked  to 
monetary policy. These are the link between resource utilisation and inflation, and the limits 
for stabilisation policy.  
Monetary  policy  affects  inflation  through  its  impact  on  the  exchange  rate  and  thereby 
resource utilisation in the economy, but also through its influence on demand and inflation 
expectations. It may appear strange that inflation is calculated to be close to the target of two 
per cent, despite the fact that resource utilisation has fallen rapidly and is so low during the 
forecast period. 
There are two explanations for this. Firstly, the connection between resource utilisation and 
inflation is weaker now than before. I mentioned this in my introduction. And this is probably 
because a changeover to a credible monetary policy that is aimed at stabilising inflation will 
lead to the connection between resource utilisation and inflation weakening. Stable inflation 
6 
 BIS Review 66/2009
expectations close to the inflation target quite simply provide less scope for other variables to 
affect inflation.4  
But  the  connection  is  not  negligible.  The  expansionary  monetary  policy  in  the  world  as  a 
whole, the large GDP growth in the world during the years 2004-2007 and the increasingly 
high resource utilisation finally led to substantial rises in energy, food and other commodity 
prices in the world market, and thereby also to rising consumer prices. The forecasts now 
being made both by international organisations and by ourselves indicate that inflation in the 
world over the coming years will be positive, despite the low resource utilisation, but slightly 
lower than was normal a few years ago.  
The other explanation as to why inflation in Sweden is remaining close to the target despite 
the low resource utilisation is that there are other factors than resource utilisation which exert 
upward pressure on prices. One such factor is that unit labour costs have been increasing by 
around 5 per cent a year during the period 2007-2009. Slightly higher wage agreements, but 
above all falling productivity, have contributed to pushing up unit labour costs, something that 
will  change  in  the  future  as  companies  reduce  their  workforces.  Another  factor  that  is 
underpinning inflation is the weak krona. 
Given  this,  the  assessment  I  made  at  the  most  recent  monetary  policy  meeting  was,  as  I 
recently mentioned, that there was no reason to worry about either deflation or high inflation 
during the forecast period. Resource utilisation is not so low that it could lead to deflation, but 
it is sufficiently low to prevent inflation from becoming too high. 
The  second  question I would  like  to  take  up  is  the  limits  for  stabilisation  policy.  There  are 
limits as to what stabilisation policy can achieve with regard to alleviating the consequences 
for the Swedish economy of such a powerful and global economic recession as the one we 
are undergoing. For fiscal policy the limits are set by what is considered compatible with a 
long-term  sustainable  development  in  public  sector  finances.  Monetary  policy  is  to  some 
extent limited by the fact that there is a floor under which the repo rate cannot be cut. It is not 
possible to avoid an international economic downturn entirely, but it is possible to prevent it 
from becoming too deep. 
In monetary policy it is also necessary to take into account what might happen further ahead 
if one conducts a very expansionary monetary policy over a long period of time. In particular 
the experiences of the years with low interest rates and rapid international growth prior to the 
current financial crisis indicate that one may also need to take into account the more long-
term consequences of monetary policy and at what pace inflation should be brought back on 
target. 
There is also reason to take into account not only the total amount of spare resources in the 
economy,  but  also  the  composition  of  those  resources.  For  an  export-dependent  country 
such as Sweden it is important, for instance, to take into account to what extent a large fall in 
exports could be replaced by other parts of demand through expansionary monetary policy 
and at what rate this could be done without inflation problems arising. Correspondingly, one 
may need to take into account the extent to which the labour supply will decline as a result of 
the  depth  and  length  of  the  recession  when  assessing  what  consequences  a  coming 
recovery may have for wage formation. 
The  conclusion  I  draw  from  this  is  that  it  is  important  not  to  overestimate  the  available 
resources  in  the  economy  over  the  coming  years.  We  must  try  to  make  the  best  possible 
assessments of the amount of resources that will disappear more permanently as a result of

the  recession  and  of  how  quickly  output  can  increase  without  causing  inflation  problems. 
Otherwise there is a risk that we will conduct an expansionary monetary policy for too long 
and thus risk inflation problems later on. 
One necessary condition for conducting effective monetary policy is that the financial system 
functions.  Since  last  autumn  the  Riksbank  has  taken  a  number  of  measures  to  safeguard 
financial stability, in particular the extensive lending to the banks. We have recently decided 
to extend the eligible counterparties for our monetary policy operations and to offer the banks 
the opportunity to borrow from the Riksbank not merely at maturities of three months and six 
months, but also at twelve months.  
If economic developments should prove to be much worse than we are now predicting, there 
may be reason to proceed with more unconventional measures to support the economy. One 
possibility is to do as they have in a number of other countries and purchase government, 
mortgage  and  corporate  bonds.  We  are  currently  examining  the  experiences  of  other 
countries  and  analysing  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  this  type  of  measure.  For 
instance, we need to consider to what extent it is the Riksbank that is best suited to carry out 
this type of measure and whether it might instead be a task for a government agency.  
Summary 
I would like to summarise my speech as follows: 
Resource utilisation is falling rapidly and is at an unusually low level. All of the measures of 
resource utilisation that we have provide the same general picture. 
But it is difficult to ascertain how low it is and when it will turn around. Different measures 
paint different pictures on this issue. The GDP gap implies that resource utilisation will fall to 
minus 4-5 per cent at the beginning of 2010 before it turns around, and the employment gap 
points  to  resource  utilisation  falling  to  minus  3  per  cent  in  2011  before  the  labour  market 
begins  to  improve.  However,  in  both  of  these  cases  the  measures  are  based  on  very 
uncertain estimates of the available resources in the economy. 
It  is  also  difficult  to  ascertain  what  consequences  the  low  resource  utilisation  will  have  for 
inflation and monetary policy. The assessment we made at the most recent monetary policy 
meeting was that the policy rate ought to be cut to 0.5 per cent. With this cut and the low 
level  of  the  policy  rate  that  we  envisaged,  resource  utilisation  would  show  an  upturn  and 
underlying  inflation  would  be  close  to  two  per  cent  during  the  forecast  period.  If 
developments were to prove much more negative, there is a possibility to proceed with more 
unconventional measures.
