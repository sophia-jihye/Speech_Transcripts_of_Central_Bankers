José De Gregorio: Recent monetary policy actions and their effects  
Speech by Mr José De Gregorio, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, before the Finance 
Commission of the Honorable Chamber of Representatives, Santiago, 27 July 2009. 
 Thank you, Mr. President of the Honorable Chamber of Representatives, Representative Mr. 
Julio  Dittborn  for  the  invitation  of  the  Chamber’s  Finance  Commission  to  speak  about  the 
effects of the monetary policy decisions we have adopted over the course of this year.  
Last March, at a special session of the Economic, Promotion and Development Commission 
of  this  Chamber,  we  presented  our  view  on  the  pass-through  we  then  observed in  market 
interest  rates  of  our  monetary  policy  decisions.  In  following  months,  the  Central  Bank  has 
taken  additional  measures  that  have  significantly  increased  the  monetary  stimulus.  The 
possibility  of  revisiting  this  subject,  now  before  the  Honorable  Finance  Commission  is, 
therefore,  very  timely  and  very  welcome,  because  it  gives  us  the  chance  to  present  an 
analysis of the effects of our latest decisions. 
I wish to remind you that monetary policy, especially under an inflation targeting regime with 
a floating exchange rate like the one we have in place in Chile since 1999, is an important 
stabilizer  of  the  business  cycle.  Thanks  to  institutional  developments  and  high  degrees  of 
solvency  and  liquidity  of  our  economy,  the  monetary  policy  makers  have  been  able  to  act 
with unusual vigor. This has allowed us to confront the negative effects of the global turmoil 
on  our  country’s  demand  and  output  decisively.  Let  me  begin  by  reviewing  the  monetary 
policy measures we have adopted since the beginnings of the global turmoil. 
The monetary policy measures to address the global crisis 
Since the early stages of the global crisis, monetary policy has acted aggressively to cushion 
the effects of the crisis on our economy. Our main policy instrument – the monetary policy 
rate (MPR) – influences the cost of interbank lending at one day term. Because the credits 
that banks provide to households and firms are at longer terms, what is central to determine 
the  magnitude  of  the  monetary  impulse  is  the  future  path  of  the  MPR  expected  by  the 
market, rather than its current level. Thus, although the MPR was kept constant at 8.25% in 
the latter months of last year, the communication of the external scenario meltdown and its 
disinflationary consequences, together with the incorporation of an explicit bias, pulled down 
MPR  expectations  significantly  between  October  and  December,  also  affecting  the  market 
interest rates.  
This process was substantially heightened between January and March of this year, when 
the  Board  cut  the  MPR  by  600  basis  points,  above  what  the  market  and  analysts  were 
expecting.  Between  April  and  June,  the  MPR  was  cut  further,  by  a  combined  150  basis 
points. The Central Bank stated, repeatedly, even in our May Monetary Policy Report, that 
the monetary stimulus would be sustained for a prolonged period, even beyond what could 
be  inferred  from  financial  asset  prices  at  the  time.  Finally,  in  our  latest  monetary  policy 
meeting on the 9th of July, the Board cut the MPR to its minimum level (0.5%), indicating 
again that the MPR would be kept at expansionary levels for a prolonged period of time. In 
order to reinforce this decision and align financial asset prices and the money market interest 
rates  with  the  monetary  policy  path,  complementary  measures  were  adopted  for  the 
provision of liquidity and the administration of our debt. 
After this rapid process of monetary easing, that has no precedent in any emerging economy 
nor in our economic history, the expectations regarding the level of the MPR have shown a 
very significant adjustment (figure 1). Not only has the shortest segment of the yield curve 
shifted  downward,  close  to  the  current  MPR  level  and  the  new  measures  of  liquidity

provision,  but  the  longer-term  segments  as  well.  Private  expectations  and  financial  asset 
prices  are  showing  that  the  expansionary  monetary  policy  stance  will  remain  in  place  for 
several  more  quarters,  or  even  years.  Our 
latest  monetary  policy  decision  was 
complemented,  as  I  just  said,  with  additional  measures  that  enhanced  its  impact.  Deposit 
rates  dropped  significantly  at  maturities  of  one  year  or  more,  while  the  rates  on  our 
instruments at terms of two or more years, also fell after the announcements.  
One  issue  that  has  been  on  the  table,  not  only  in  Chile  but  in  the  developed  world  and  a 
number  of  emerging  economies  as  well,  is  precisely  the  behavior  of  longer-term  interest 
rates. Unlike those at very short term, which are largely arbitraged by the monetary policy 
stance, interest rates on long term government bonds are more influenced by, among other 
factors,  the  appetite  for  risk,  the  evolution  of  interest  rates  around  the  world  and  the 
widespread  uncertainty  prevailing  in  the  economy.  This  last  point  is  connected  with 
expectations for long-term inflation and growth and fiscal solvency prospects, with particular 
strength in those economies that have had to embark in costly financial packages and bank 
bail-out  programs,  thereby  multiplying  their  levels  of  public  debt.  In  some  emerging 
economies, and even in some developed ones, this increased debt has spurred doubts about 
the  sustainability  of  their  fiscal  accounts  and  monetary  arrangements,  questioning  their 
capacity to grow in the coming years.  
Although  luckily,  and  thanks  to  the  efforts  made,  the  Chilean  economy  is  not  in  such  a 
situation, the determination of the long-term interest rates does depend indisputably not only 
on  the  prospects  for  growth  and  inflation  –  and  thus  on  monetary  policy  –  but  also  on 
portfolio decisions of domestic agents and the appetite for risk. Developments early this year 
are very illustrative. At times where there was still high uncertainty, and there was a higher 
demand for safety and liquidity, the long-term interest rates of various public instruments in 
Chile went to record lows. As this uncertainty faded, the precautionary demand followed suit, 
pushing up long-term interest rates in pesos and in UF until the end of May. In the last couple 
of months, because of a string of episodes of higher and lower doubts about the true strength 
of the global recovery, long-term interest rates have fluctuated, but always above the levels 
of  early  this  year.  A  similar  pattern  has  been  seen  in  long-term  interest  rates  around  the 
world (figure 2). 
We  are  not  indifferent  to  the  evolution  of  long-term  interest  rates.  This  is  evident  from  the 
facts that, to enhance our last monetary policy measure, we have not only begun providing 
liquidity at the current MPR level for up to six months, but we have also suspended issues of 
instruments at one to two years’ terms. Furthermore, we permanently take into consideration 
bond issuance plans of the Treasury before defining our own programs.  
Nonetheless,  it  is  necessary  to  undertake  a  careful  analysis  of  the  long-term  interest  rate 
levels to properly assess their implications. After all, very low long-term rates are a symptom 
of depressed prospects for long-term growth and strong demand for safety. At the end of the 
day, what matters is the cost of borrowing for households and firms, which does not stem 
directly  from  risk-free  interest  rate  structures,  but  goes  through  the  filters  of  the  capital 
market and the banking system.  
Pass-through from monetary policy to market interest rates  
As I indicated the latest monetary policy measures were clearly transmitted to the banking 
system’s borrowing rates, thanks to the complementary measures adopted by the Board at 
its last meeting (figure 3).  
Last March, we stated that the aggressive reductions to the MPR implemented by the Board 
in  January  and  February  had  begun  passing  through  to  the  cost  of  borrowing  faced  by 
households  and  firms,  affirming  that  such  transmission  could  be  reasonably  expected  to 
continue.  This  diagnosis  still  holds,  particularly  after  what  we  have  seen  since  our  last 
meeting  and  especially  in  consumer  and  commercial  loans  (figure  4).  We  estimate  that, 
2

without the 425 basis point’s reduction of the MPR that began in March, consumer lending 
rates  would  be  between  400  and  500  basis  points  above  their  current  levels.  Short-term 
commercial credit rates, at 30 to 89 days, would be between 350 and 450 basis points above 
their current figures. Long-term mortgage loans would be some 25 to 30 basis points higher. 
We believe that the reduced funding costs of financial institutions will continue to be passed 
on  to  the  cost  of  credit  with  the  usual  lags.  We  expect  the  banking  industry  to  actively 
cooperate in this process. 
A full normalization of credit demand and supply conditions will have to wait until the dust 
settles in the international financial scenario, to allow more clarity about global and domestic 
growth prospects. These risk factors have a direct incidence on credit risk premiums implicit 
in banking operations. We can see that the monetary policy action has more than offset the 
increase in risk premiums, resulting in a significant drop in credit costs, thus mitigating the 
effects that the global crisis has had on our economy.  
One important aspect of the access to credit, aside from its cost, draws from the effect of the 
environment  of  uncertainty  and  economic  weakness  on  the  credit  approval  conditions  and 
credit  demand.  In  these  dimensions,  we  have  recently  seen  signs  of  stabilization. 
Internationally, the various indicators of uncertainty and risk in global financial markets, while 
remain  relatively  high,  have  continued  to  fall.  Domestically,  the  evidence  at  hand from  the 
Banking Credit Survey for the second quarter of this year reveals that, on average, banking 
institutions have already stopped tightening their lending standards and perceive early signs 
of a recovery of the demand for credit. This is particularly evident in the mortgage segment, 
suggesting that the levels of the long-term interest rates on these loans are not necessarily 
holding back the demand for housing credit (figure 5). Also, early in the year we witnessed a 
substantial increase in issues of corporate bonds, which can be interpreted as the response 
to less favorable financing conditions in both the domestic and the external banking market, 
a situation that has lost momentum in recent months. 
Conclusions 
Monetary  policy  has  acted  aggressively  to  soften  the  impact  of  the  global  financial  crisis. 
Although it is impossible to fully offset all the repercussions that such a severe crisis has on a 
small, open economy like Chile, especially with the lags that monetary policy operates, we 
have  succeeded  as  a  country  in  mitigating  them  substantially.  We  have  preserved  the 
macroeconomic  stability  framework,  even  providing  room  for  an  extraordinarily  stimulating 
mix of macroeconomic policies. Therefore, we can now state without a doubt that, had we 
not  adopted  the  stimulus  actions  you  have  seen  in  recent  months,  our  country’s  economy 
would be in considerably weaker shape and we would not be able to envision any prospects 
of recovery for the second half of this year. 
Conditions are ripe for the Chilean economy to experience a healthy recovery of output and 
expenditure during the second half of this year. For the economy to pick up, however, it will 
still require that the global uncertainty, regarding both the financial dimensions of the crisis 
and  its  effects  on  world  activity,  fades.  We  have  seen  promising  signs  allowing  us  to  be 
hopeful, but it is premature to think that the bad news are over. For this reason, we believe 
that it will be necessary to maintain the monetary stimulus for a prolonged period of time, in 
order  to  ensure  that  inflation  approaches  its  3%  target  and  prevent  it  from  stabilizing 
undesirably below that target. The latest decision of the Central Bank Board and its recent 
effects are proof that the monetary policy has effective instruments to continue applying the 
monetary stimulus even with the MPR at its minimum. 
Again, 
the  Honorable  Chamber  of 
Representatives  and  its  President,  Representative  Mr.  Julio  Dittborn,  for  letting  me  share 
with you our visions. The transparency with which we conduct our monetary policy is crucial 
in the uncertain global environment we are still enduring. Thank you very much.
