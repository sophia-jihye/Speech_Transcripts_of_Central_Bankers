Karolina Ekholm: Balancing monetary policy – when theory meets 
practice 
Speech  by  Ms  Karolina  Ekholm,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  SEB, 
Stockholm, 18 September 2009.  
 As  I  am  sure  most  of  you  know,  I  am  the  newest  member  of  the  Executive  Board  of  the 
Riksbank. I was appointed in January this year – at the height of the financial crisis – and 
took  up  my  post  in  March  when  virtually  all  the  curves  for  the  development  of  the  real 
economy were pointing sharply downwards. 
The  period  since  my  appointment  has  been  very  intensive  and  highly  instructive.  As  a 
university  lecturer  in  economics,  part  of  my  baggage  included  the  textbook  descriptions  of 
how  monetary  policy  is  conducted.  I  soon  realised,  however,  that  there  are  significant 
differences between theory and practice. For example, the financial markets work fairly well 
in theory. At the time I joined the Executive Board, however, this was definitely not the case. 
This  meant  that  I  faced  entirely  new  monetary  policy  considerations  compared  to  those 
presented in the textbook analyses of monetary policy. 
I had actually suspected that monetary policy is much more difficult in practice than in theory 
already before I began working at the Riksbank. I am sure that these suspicions would have 
been confirmed even under more normal circumstances. Now, however, my induction period 
has  been  marked  by  the  extraordinary  conditions  that  currently  govern  monetary  policy:  a 
financial crisis that has still not really come to an end, a very dramatic economic downturn 
and  a  repo  rate  that  is  close  to  zero.  It  has  definitely  not  been  a  gentle  settling-in  period! 
Today, I intend to tell you a little about these early experiences and to explain how I view the 
monetary policy considerations that are relevant in the current economic situation. I will also 
say something about my view of monetary policy in the period ahead and to what extent we 
need to take factors other than inflation into account.  
Monetary policy in practice  
The inflation target lies at the centre of the Riksbank's monetary policy. The stated target is 
that the annual change in the consumer price index (CPI) should be 2 per cent. As far as the 
target for monetary policy is concerned there is no difference between theory and practice. 
Both theory and practice show that low and stable inflation creates favourable conditions for 
the development of the economy in the long term. There is also broad agreement between 
academics and central banks about the possibilities and limitations of monetary policy. We 
know that monetary policy can influence both the average level of inflation and how much it 
varies over time.  
Monetary  policy  can  not,  on  the  other  hand,  significantly  affect  the  average  level  of  real 
quantities such  as  production,  employment  and  unemployment.  The  average  level of  such 
quantities is determined by other factors, such as demography, competition and tax policies, 
research and development and education and training. 
There are therefore good reasons why monetary policy should focus on inflation and have an 
inflation target. 
Flexible inflation targeting policy 
A strict interpretation of the possibilities of monetary policy can easily be perceived as being 
that central banks can only affect inflation. However, although monetary policy can not affect 
the  average  level  of  real  factors,  this  does  not  mean  that  it  is  ineffectual  in  stabilising

fluctuations  in  these  factors.  I  mean  by  this  that  monetary  policy  can  contribute  to  the 
stabilisation  of  resource  utilisation  at  a  normal  level.  In  practice,  central  banks  with  an 
inflation target conduct what is called flexible inflation targeting. This flexibility means that – 
alongside  the  long-term  inflation  target  –  the  central  banks  also  strive  to  ensure  that 
fluctuations in both inflation and the real economy are kept at a reasonable level. Striking the 
right  balance  between  these  factors  is  what  the  Riksbank  calls  a  well-balanced  monetary 
policy. 
The  flexibility  of  inflation  targeting  becomes  particularly  important  in  situations  where  a 
conflict  arises  between  the  objective  of  reaching  the  inflation  target  and  the  objective  of 
stabilising the real economy. In some situations, the inflation target calls for a certain type of 
monetary  policy  while  resource  utilisation  calls  for  another.  One  example  of  this  is  the 
situation that prevailed during most of 2008, the year before I joined the Executive Board. 
Energy  and  food  prices  increased  dramatically.  This  pushed  up  inflation  to  unexpected 
levels.  At  the  same  time,  economic  activity  appeared  to  be  declining  –  a  decline  that 
eventually became a severe economic downturn. If, in such a situation, the interest rate had 
been substantially increased in order to rapidly bring inflation back down to the target, the 
economic situation could have been undermined even more. 
However, as the Riksbank works with a flexible inflation target we can choose not to bring 
inflation  back  to  the  target  as  quickly  as  possible.  This  flexibility  also  gives  us  scope  to 
stabilise the fluctuations in the real economy. How long it should take to return inflation to the 
target depends, among other things, on the type of shock that has occurred, the size of the 
shock and how long it can be expected to affect the economy.  
An almost obvious question in the exam papers on macroeconomics that I helped to set in 
the  spring  of  2008  was:  What  monetary  policy  can  a  central  bank  that  conducts  flexible 
inflation targeting be expected to pursue under the prevailing conditions and why? Full marks 
went to those who answered something like: "such a central bank can be expected to make 
relatively  moderate  interest  rate  increases  and  accept  a  level  of  inflation  that  exceeds  the 
target  in  the  short  term  but  then  falls  back  to  the  target".  This  was  also  by  and  large  the 
monetary policy conducted by the Riksbank.  
However, it can be difficult to achieve the right balance 
In theory, balancing the need to achieve the inflation target and the need to stabilise the real 
economy seems relatively simple, even when there is a conflict between these objectives as 
in 2008. However, when it comes to conducting monetary  policy in practice, achieving the 
right balance is not always so easy. 
One problem that I have probably underestimated in the past is that there are no simple and 
unambiguous  measures  of  how  much  of  the  economy's  resources  are  being  utilised  and 
what should be considered as a normal level for what we call resource utilisation. In theory it 
is relatively easy to define the so-called production gap. It is often defined as the difference 
between  what  is  actually  produced  and  what  could  be  produced  if  the  resources available 
were used to the full. But I do not really think that it is possible to measure this gap with any 
great degree of precision. One problem is that it is difficult to measure how much could be 
produced if all the resources were used to the full. This, which is sometimes called potential 
production, can not be observed directly but must be estimated.1 At the same time, there is a 
great deal of uncertainty about the best way to perform such an estimate. Getting an idea of 
resource utilisation thus requires that we, like other forecasters, look at many different types 
of  measure  and  assess  which  conclusions  regarding  resource  utilisation  seem  to  be

reasonable. Developing analysis in this area is important and such work is underway at the 
Riksbank. However, I do not think that we should expect it to be possible to find a measure 
that  is  so  reliable  that  it  can  be  used  in  a  mechanical  way  in  all  situations  to  determine 
exactly how monetary policy should be designed so that it also stabilises the real economy. 
Another  practical  problem  for  forecasters  is  that  it  is  difficult  to  identify  turning  points  in 
economic activity. Here too we have to rely on different types of indicator. We monitor, for 
example,  new  orders,  stock,  the  purchasing  managers'  index,  confidence  indicators, 
business  tendency  surveys  and,  not  least,  the  Riksbank's  own  company  interviews.  At 
present,  the  confidence  indicators  are  particularly  important.  The  downturn  began  with  a 
general  crisis  of  confidence  that  affected  both  the  financial  sector  and  the  publics' 
expectations  concerning  the  development  of  the  economy.  It  is  therefore  reasonable  to 
believe that a turnaround requires the restoration of confidence. However, it is difficult to find 
any exact and stable link between confidence indicators and actual economic development. 
So, in this context too there is scope for different assessments when it comes to interpreting 
the economic situation and the consequences for monetary policy. 
New and difficult monetary policy considerations recently  
No longer a conflict of objectives 
When I took up my post as a member of the Executive Board, there was no longer really a 
conflict between upholding the inflation target and stabilising the real economy. Energy and 
food prices began to fall already in the summer of 2008. The global financial crisis that hit 
with full force in the autumn of 2008 contributed to a dramatic economic downturn in both 
Sweden  and  abroad.  This  reinforced  the  rapid  fall  in  inflation.  At  the  monetary  policy 
meetings that I participated in during the spring and summer it was easy to make decisions 
about  the  direction  of  changes  to  the  repo  rate.  Both  inflation  and  the  economic  situation 
justified reductions in the interest rate and the repo rate was indeed cut, first to 0.5 per cent 
in April and then to the all-time low of 0.25 per cent in July. 
Any textbook on macroeconomics would have prescribed a cut in such a situation. However, 
the  monetary  policy  decisions  during  the  spring  and  autumn  were  still  complicated.  The 
difficult  question,  at  least  from  my  point  of  view,  was  how  much  should  the  repo  rate  be 
reduced. Because we had cut the repo rate so quickly and substantially during the autumn of 
2008 and early 2009, the scope for pursuing traditional monetary began to shrink as the repo 
rate began to approach its lower limit. 
Determining what level is the repo rate's lower limit also proved to be difficult. Can the repo 
rate be cut all the way to zero, or even to a negative level? There is no clear answer to these 
questions. However, in line with the majority of the Executive Board, my assessment in July 
was that the repo rate should not be cut beyond 0.25 per cent. The reasons for this were the 
concern  that  some  financial  markets  would  find  it  difficult  to  function  normally  at  lower 
interest rate levels and that it could have a negative impact on the profitability of the banks. 
My view was that the economic situation in principle called for an even greater cut. At the 
same  time,  I  thought  it was  too  risky  to  reduce  the  repo  rate  even  more  when  we  did  not 
really know how the financial markets would function with such low interest rates. 
One  can  note  after  the  event  that  cutting  the  repo  rate  to  0.25  per  cent  was  carried  out 
without any apparent problems. In this perspective, the fears that I had in July would seem to 
be  somewhat  exaggerated.  On  the  other  hand,  I  believe  that  it  is  worthwhile  for  a  central 
bank to act with some caution in areas where it does not have any previous experience to 
draw on. This is why I feel that it was justified to reduce the repo rate in small stages when 
we were already at a record-low level in the initial position.

Measures when the interest rate is close to zero 
What  then  should  a  central  bank  do  when  the  policy  rate  can  not  be  lowered  to  the  level 
justified  by  the  state  of  the  real  economy?  Many  central  banks  have  struggled  with  this 
question during this crisis. One possibility is to allow the policy rate to remain at the lowest 
possible level for a longer period than would otherwise have been required. The effects of 
such a decision can also be reinforced in several ways. The central bank can, for example, 
lend money to the banks at a fixed interest rate at a maturity that corresponds to the period 
during  which  the  policy  rate  is  expected  to  remain  at  this  low  level.  This  can  increase  the 
credibility of the forecast that the rate will remain unchanged in the year ahead. It should also 
push down some interest rates at longer maturities. We decided to implement both of these 
measures. Since the monetary policy meeting in February, our forecast has comprised a low 
repo rate during a relatively long period of time. At the monetary policy meetings in July and 
September 2009, we also decided to lend money to the banks for one year at a fixed interest 
rate. 
The  Riksbank's  current  monetary  policy  has  to  be  characterised  as  highly  expansionary. 
Such a policy may lead to fears of a too high level of inflation in the future. Personally, I do 
not think that such fears are justified. The inflation target is, as usual, the focal point of our 
repo rate decisions. However, as long as the target is not threatened we should do what we 
can to contribute to the stable development of production and employment. This is why we 
believe there is a need to keep the repo rate at an exceptionally low level for an unusually 
long period of time. It does not appear that inflation will be a major problem, while various 
measures of resource utilisation indicate that it will remain very low over the year ahead. 
Monetary policy and financial stability 
The financial crisis has led to a discussion about whether monetary policy should also take 
into  account  signs  of  the  development  of  financial  bubbles  and  aim  to  counteract  such 
tendencies. This is an important discussion that I and others in the world of central banking 
will have reason to return to. One of the explicit tasks of the Riksbank is to promote stability 
and an efficient payment system. The Riksbank will therefore, whatever the circumstances, 
take measures if the stability of the system is threatened. This task has, for example, been 
the reason for the crisis measures that the Riksbank has taken since the autumn. However, 
we need to discuss whether situations can arise in which flexible inflation targeting conflicts 
with the aim of promoting financial stability. If so, should interest-rate policy be modified or is 
it more appropriate to use other instruments to, for example, counteract the development of 
financial bubbles? I have no ready answers to these questions today. They partly relate to 
the question of the causes of the current financial crisis. Has monetary policy contributed to 
the crisis through low interest rates or do the causes lie in entirely different factors, such as 
global  imbalances  and/or  inadequate  regulation  and  supervision  of  the  financial  markets? 
The analysis of the causes of the crisis has begun, but it is still far too soon to draw any clear 
conclusions about the contribution of different factors. 
The current economic situation 
But what are the prospects for the economy in the period ahead and what challenges are we 
facing  now?  The  financial  crisis  reinforced  the  international  economic  downturn.  It  is 
therefore  natural  to  expect  that  a  recovery  will  only  come  when  the  situation  on  the 
international financial markets has normalised. 
Stabilisation of the financial sector 
The situation on the financial markets has continued to improve during the summer. This is 
reflected by the fact that risk premiums on the interbank market, for example the TED and 
basis  spreads,  have  fallen  to  levels  close  to  those  that  applied  before  the  outbreak  of  the 
4 
 BIS Review 111/2009
financial  crisis  in  both  Sweden  and  abroad  (see  Figure  1).  The  stock  market  has  also 
recovered strongly. Swedish companies have gradually found it easier to find funding on the 
international capital markets. But the situation is still strained. The interest rates offered to 
Swedish companies are high in comparison to the interest rates for government securities, 
that is the credit spreads are still high. In addition, corporate demand for export guarantees is 
much higher at present than has been the case previously. This indicates that the funding 
situation of the companies is still strained. 
International economic activity show signs of recovery 
Since  the  monetary  policy  meeting  in  July,  signs  have  emerged  of  a  slowdown  in  the 
economic downturn abroad. In some countries, there are now even signs of a recovery. This 
can  be  seen,  for  example,  if  we  look  at  world  trade,  which  has  now  begun  to  stabilise 
following the collapse at the start of the year (see Figure 2). Both outcomes and indicators of 
future  economic  growth  have  stabilised  or  shown  an  upturn  in  most  regions.  In  Asia,  in 
particular, growth has clearly picked up during the second quarter of this year (see Figure 3). 
This is because domestic demand in China has increased, which in turn stimulates exports in 
the  Asian  countries.  Nevertheless, although  the  positive  signs  of  a  recovery  that  we  could 
already see in July have strengthened, there is still uncertainty about future developments. 
In the USA, which is suffering its most prolonged recession since the 1940s, there are signs 
of  a  light  at  the  end  of  the  tunnel.  The  housing  market  has  improved  and  the  statistics 
indicate that the fall in house prices has come to a halt (see Figure 4). After four quarters of 
falling GDP, growth in the third quarter is now expected to be positive (see Figure 5). The 
labour market is continuing to weaken, however, and unemployment has reached almost 10 
per cent, which is an unusually high figure for the USA. 
Development in the euro area has been somewhat better than our assessment in early July. 
It appears that the fall in GDP has come to a halt. Several of the major economies have even 
reported positive GDP growth. However, the situation on the labour market has deteriorated 
further. Unemployment is almost at the same level as in the USA.  
The fall in Sweden's GDP is slowing down 
Development in a small open economy like Sweden is highly dependent on the development 
of economic activity abroad and Sweden has also been hit hard by the severe international 
downturn.  GDP  has  fallen  for  five  quarters  in  a  row.  However,  since  the  beginning  of  the 
second quarter of this year this fall has slowed down and GDP even increased somewhat 
between  the  first  and  second  quarters  (see  Figure  6).  Furthermore,  indicators  for 
development in the third quarter, such as the purchasing managers’ index and the Economic 
Tendency Survey, point to the recovery coming slightly sooner than we previously believed. 
We have therefore revised our forecast for growth in 2009 upwards slightly. But the recovery 
will begin from a very low level. Sweden’s GDP is now expected to fall by 4.9 per cent this 
year  compared  with  last  year.  This  is  the  largest  decline  in  Swedish  GDP  in  an  individual 
year since 1940. 
The labour market is still showing weak development 
Despite the slightly brighter picture of economic growth, the situation on the labour market is 
expected  to  be  gloomy  for  some  time  to  come  (see  Figure  7).  This  is  because  the  labour 
market can not improve as long as the companies have unutilised resources and still need to 
reduce their workforces. Unemployment is therefore expected to increase both this year and 
next year. Our assessment is that unemployment will not increase again until 2011.

Inflation is currently low  
Inflation has fallen rapidly since the end of last year and we believe that it will be negative for 
a  large  part  of  the  year.  The  fact  that  inflation,  measured  in  terms  of  the  Consumer  Price 
Index, the CPI, has fallen so quickly is primarily due to the fall in energy prices and mortgage 
costs. Inflation measured in terms of the CPIF, in which mortgage rates are kept constant, is 
more stable but it is expected to be below 2 per cent for most of the forecast period (see 
Figure 8). 
My view of the situation 
At  the  latest  monetary  policy  meeting,  I  advocated  an  unchanged  repo  rate  and  repo  rate 
forecast.  This  was  also  the  decision  made  by  the  majority.  As  in  July,  we  also  decided  to 
offer  our  monetary  policy  counterparties  loans  at  a  fixed  interest  rate  for  one  year.  As  I 
mentioned  earlier,  this  can  strengthen  expectations  that  the  repo  rate  will  remain  at  the 
decided level throughout the maturity of the loans and also contribute to lower interest rates 
for households and companies in other ways. 
Many analysts felt that the decision to leave the repo rate unchanged was self-evident. The 
decision  to  retain  the  same  repo  rate  path  that  we  adopted  in  July  was  perhaps  more 
unexpected. I will explain the reasoning that led to my conclusion that this constitutes a well-
balanced monetary policy. 
There  are  several  factors  to  take  into  account  in  this  decision.  Perhaps  the  most  obvious 
factor is the change in the economic prospects. As I mentioned earlier, the forecast for GDP 
growth in Sweden has been revised upwards somewhat. Irrespective of which indicators you 
look at, resource utilisation is still very low in Sweden and abroad and the development of 
employment  is  expected  to  be  weak  throughout  next  year.  There  is  also  great  uncertainty 
about how strong and stable the recovery will be. It is positive that there has been a clear 
improvement  in  the  situation  on  the  financial  markets.  This  reduces  the  risk  of  a  serious 
setback. On the other hand, the situation on these markets has not completely normalised. 
Central banks around the world will continue to use various measures to help the banks find 
funding.  The  extensive  fiscal  policy  stimulation  measures  that  have  been  and  are  being 
implemented in all the major economies have in all likelihood helped to dampen the fall in 
GDP.  But,  they  are  also  leading  to  increases  in  national  debts.  This  can  create  anxiety 
among the households and thus entails a risk that recovery will stop short.  
Nevertheless, the situation looks brighter today than it did a couple of months ago. This in 
itself  justifies  a  somewhat  tighter  monetary  policy  than  that  which  we  regarded  as  a  well-
balanced monetary policy in July. However, there are also factors that can have the opposite 
effect  and  thus  represent  arguments  for  a  more  expansionary  monetary  policy.  The 
development of the krona has been stronger than we expected. Just as it is difficult to explain 
the earlier weakening of the krona in terms of developments in the Swedish economy, it is 
difficult to explain the recent appreciation in the krona. The best explanation might be that it 
is  a  question  of  an  adjustment  towards  more  normal  levels  after  the  exchange  rate  had 
strongly deviated from its long-term reasonable rate. However, a strengthening of the krona 
weakens  inflation.  As  inflation  is  expected  to  be  slightly  below  the  target  over  the  coming 
years – and now I am referring to inflation adjusted for the effect of interest rate changes on 
housing costs – this is something that in itself could be an argument for a more expansionary 
monetary policy. 
The  brighter  economic  prospects  thus  point  towards  a  tighter  monetary  policy,  while  the 
stronger krona points towards a more expansionary monetary policy. I believe that there is 
more  uncertainty  about  the  development  of  the  krona  in  the  period  ahead  than  about  the 
development of economic activity. I therefore attach relatively little importance to the krona 
when assessing what would be a well-balanced monetary policy.

 BIS Review 111/2009
This  means  that  I  instead  place  greater  importance  on  the  improved  economic  prospects. 
However,  despite  the  fact  that  prospects  now  seem  a  little  brighter,  it  is  still  the case  that 
resource utilisation is expected to be significantly below normal over the next few years. This 
means that there is still a need for monetary policy stimulation to stabilise the real economy. 
Nor  does  it  appear  that  such  stimulation  will  conflict  with  the  inflation  target.  Inflation 
measured in terms of the CPIF is expected to be slightly below the target of 2 per cent in the 
next few years. All in all, there is therefore nothing at the moment that calls for a tightening of 
monetary policy at a faster rate than in our assessment in July.  
Nor can I see, as economic activity has improved, any weighty reasons for making monetary 
policy more expansionary by reducing the repo rate even further. The adopted line, with a 
repo  rate  of  0.25  per  cent  that  is  expected  to  remain  unchanged  for  several  quarters, 
represents a very expansionary monetary policy. My view is that this policy should only be 
changed  if  inflation  and/or  the  economic  situation  change  considerably  compared  to  our 
current forecasts. 
Concluding remarks 
I have now shared with you some of my experiences during my early months as a member of 
the Executive Board of the Riksbank. I realised already when I accepted the job that it would 
not be easy. However, the fact that monetary policy decision-making is not as straightforward 
as it appears in theory only serves to make the job even more exciting. 
A  well-balanced  monetary  policy  presupposes  that  we  arrive  at  a  reasonable  balance 
between  achieving  the  inflation  target  and  stabilising  the  real  economy.  A  reasonable 
balance requires in turn that we can effectively measure how much inflation deviates from 
the  target  and  how  resource  utilisation  relates  to  its  normal  level.  We  have  fairly  good 
measures  of  inflation,  although  it  has  been  a  problem  recently  that  our  main  measure  of 
inflation, the CPI, is so highly affected by our own repo rate decisions through their effects on 
housing costs. Consequently, at our most recent monetary policy meetings we have almost 
exclusively focused on alternative measures from which housing costs are excluded.  
The problems concerning how measures of resource utilisation relate to the normal level are, 
however,  greater.  It  is  difficult  enough  to  measure  resource  utilisation,  but  it  is  even  more 
difficult  to  measure  what  its  normal  level  is.  Instead  we  have  to  weigh  together  different 
measures and indicators in a reasonable way. This of course provides greater scope for a 
wider range of assessments. The financial crisis has, not least, also raised the question of to 
what extent monetary policy should take financial stability into account. This is an important 
question that should be analysed further.  
Let  me  conclude  by  saying  that  it  appears  that  the  fiscal  policy  and  monetary  policy 
stimulation measures that are being implemented throughout the world are beginning to have 
the  desired  effects.  The  situation  in  the  financial  sector  has  improved  and  an  economic 
recovery is now discernable. But it is still uncertain whether the recovery is stable or whether 
there  is  a  risk  that  it  will  come  to  a  halt  as  soon  as  the  fiscal  policy  and  monetary  policy 
stimulation measures are phased out. Deciding the appropriate time to begin the phase-out 
of the now very extensive monetary policy stimulation measures is a major challenge. If the 
phase-out begins too early there is a risk that the recovery will come to a halt. If we wait too 
long, there is a risk that we will need to increase the repo rate very quickly in order to meet 
the inflation target. This is a balance that is much easier to achieve in theory than in practice! 
However,  as  I  have  explained  here  today,  my  assessment  at  the  latest  monetary  policy 
meeting was that it will still be necessary to keep the repo rate at this low level for a long time 
to come.  
Thank you!
