José De Gregorio: Monetary policy and financial stability – an emerging 
markets perspective  
Presentation  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  at  the 
Brookings Institution, Washington DC, 17 September 2009. 
 It is a pleasure to participate in this meeting and to speak about the lessons for monetary 
policy  the  current  crisis  is  teaching  us.  The  big  difference  between  the  current  crisis  with 
previous ones in emerging economies is that this time “it was not our fault.” The evidence on 
the performance of emerging countries facing an unprecedented global downturn shows that 
some lessons have been properly learned. 
Today  I  would  like  to  concentrate  on  inflation  targets,  especially  in  the  context  of  strongly 
rising and strongly falling commodity prices, financial stability and exchange rate fluctuations. 
Many  of  the  issues  I  will  be  discussing  today  I  have  covered  in  recent  presentations 
elsewhere. Indeed, there is not much new material, but I think those are important issues in 
conducting monetary policy in emerging countries. 
The causes of the crisis: was it monetary policy or was it financial fragility? 
1.  
The  argument  blaming  monetary  policy  for  the  current  crisis  claims  that  low  interest  rates 
combined  with  large  current  account  surpluses  in  emerging  economies,  particularly  Asian 
and oil-exporting ones, created an abundance of liquidity that triggered excessive increases 
in asset prices (bubbles). This was particularly acute in the housing market. When the bubble 
burst, the crisis erupted. Then, this argument claims that the housing bubble was caused by 
monetary  policy,  which  failed  to  act  opportunely  and  permitted  severe  imbalances  to 
accumulate. Nonetheless, one must bear in mind that soaring asset prices do not necessarily 
end  up  in  a  crisis  like  this  one.  Closer  attention  must  be  paid  to  the  financial  fragility  that 
accompanied this process, whose main culprit was the unrestrained financial innovation that 
generated deep distortions that neither markets nor regulators were able to predict. 
An  expansionary  monetary  policy  can  undoubtedly  induce  an  excessive  increase  in  the 
prices of assets and credit. The ultimate role of monetary policy is to smooth the business 
cycle  and  control  inflation.1  Therefore,  it  is  possible  to  think  that  a  very  expansionary 
monetary policy, more so than that needed to reach the inflation target, can exacerbate an 
economic boom. Moreover, such a policy will have serious consequences on output once the 
monetary impulse is withdrawn. However, an expansionary monetary policy could not explain 
by  itself  the  severity  of  the  financial  collapse  and  the  global  recession  the  world  is  seeing 
today. 
There  are  countries  where  monetary  policy  was  expansionary,  with  interest  rates  at  their 
minimum, and no housing bubble nor financial collapses occurred. A couple of examples are 
Canada  and  Chile,  two  inflation  targeters  where,  consistently  with  this  policy  framework, 
interest  rates  hit  very  low  levels  not  so  different  from  the  Fed  Funds  rate  (Figure  1).  Still, 
housing  prices  generally  did  not  experience  increases  comparable  with  those  of  other 
economies, and their financial systems have remained sound. 
Furthermore, in some cases housing prices did go up high, with clear indications that there 
was a bubble. However, their financial systems made it through and remained stable and, 
                                                 
1   A flexible inflation targeting regime balances the cost of output fluctuations with those of inflation instability, 
and the result should be a decline in both, output and inflation volatility. For an exposition of this framework 
and how it relates to the definition of the inflation target parameters see De Gregorio (2009a).

despite  the current  difficulties,  have  avoided  acute  financial  crises.  This  is  the case  of,  for 
example, Australia and Spain. Naturally, when facing disproportionate increases in housing 
prices,  both  the  increase  in  credit  and  the  boom  in  construction  are  symptoms  that  the 
downturn will be severe. Still, this need not result in a systemic financial meltdown. 
In any case, monetary policy can and does help in the creation of bubbles, although not so 
much by the level of the interest rate but by the monetary policy strategy with which financial 
turmoil is dealt with. In the United States, the strategy of turning a blind eye to the period of 
soaring asset prices and then, when the bubble burst, reducing aggressively interest rates 
used to be the Fed’s strategy (the “mop-up strategy” according to Blinder and Reis, 2005). 
This  approach  was  first  used  on  the  “Black  Monday”  of  October  1987,  then  with  the 
breakdown  of  Long-Term  Capital  Management  (LTCM)  and  later  with  the  bursting  of  the 
high-tech bubble. In all these occasions, once the asset prices reversed down, there was an 
abrupt  relaxation  of  the  monetary  policy.2  This  implicit  insurance,  popularly  known  as  the 
Greenspan  put,  certainly  makes  the  creation  of  bubbles  more  likely.  This  strategy,  which 
worked in some earlier episodes, failed miserably during the biggest collapse in decades. A 
monetary policy strategy that used to provide insurance to speculation in episodes of limited 
financial turbulence proved incapable of confronting a financial crisis of systemic proportions.  
This strategy to deal with bubbles is a prescription derived not from inflation targeting, but 
from a need to insure financial stability. In my view, financial stability must be addressed first 
with appropriate regulation of the financial system that limits the excesses we saw before the 
crisis. There may be situations in which it might be appropriate to deviate transitorily from an 
inflation targeting regime in order to ensure financial stability, but this must be an exception, 
which  in  normal  times  should  not  arise.  I  think  a  first  lesson  for  the  conduct  of  monetary 
policy is to avoid providing insurance to speculators, which creates enormous moral hazard 
problems. In emerging countries we have lived this, with much milder consequences, when 
we attempted to manage exchange rates disconnected from fundamentals for a prolonged 
period of time.  
Therefore,  an  examination  of  monetary  policy  and  financial  dislocations  around  the  world 
suggests that the culprit of the current crisis was related more closely with the functioning of 
financial  systems  than  with  monetary  policy.  One  issue  that  will  have  to  be  carefully 
examined in the future is the cause of the real estate boom and the housing crisis, and why it 
occurred  in  the  United  States.  At  this  point  it  is  clear  that  lending  standards  were  relaxed 
beyond reason, and financial innovation went too far.3  
Inflation targeting and asset prices 
2. 
A corollary of those blaming monetary policy is that, apart from focusing on the variation of 
the prices of goods and services, it should also take into consideration asset prices, beyond 
their direct impact on projected inflation. 
Under  an  inflation  targeting  regime,  increased  lending  and  asset  prices  can  have 
repercussions  on  the  inflation  outlook,  through  their  impact  on  the  output  gap.  This  would 
require a monetary policy adjustment to prevent a persistent rise in inflation. Hence, in an 
inflation targeting regime, asset prices and the level of credit aggregates affect the monetary 
policy decision to the extent that they affect the inflation perspectives (Bernanke and Gertler, 
1999).

Interestingly and, according to Blinder and Reis (2005), using Taylor rules as from the first quarter of 1988, the 
residuals indicate that in all the mentioned episodes the Federal Reserve set the interest rates significantly 
below those prescribed by the rule. 
3   Ellis (2008) shows that in the U.S., households had strong motivation to increase their leverage through tax, 
legal and regulatory incentives. 
2 
 BIS Review 113/2009
However,  some  will  argue  that  monetary  policy  should  react  directly  to  asset  prices,  for 
example, by including them in the Taylor rule. Cecchetti et al. (2000) are perhaps the best 
representatives of this position, claiming that any inflation-targeting central bank should react 
to asset price misalignments beyond their implications on expected inflation over the policy 
horizon.  
In  my  view,  there  are  three  reasons  why  monetary  policy,  in  general,  should  not  react  to 
asset prices beyond their impact on projected inflation: 
• 
First, it is not clear that an increase in interest rates will be capable of stopping an 
increase in asset prices. The required adjustments might be so large that they could 
end  up  unnecessarily  generating  high  unemployment  and  an  undesired  drop  in 
inflation.  
Second,  what  matters  here  is  to  safeguard  the  stability  of  the  financial  system.  An 
excessive interest rate aiming at controlling asset prices could even trigger financial 
instability,  which  is  precisely  what  it  is  meant  to  avoid,  especially  if  the  increase  in 
asset prices is accompanied by higher financial fragility.  
Finally,  under  inflation  targeting,  any  interest  rate  movements  that  are  inconsistent 
with  inflation  converging  to  the  target  may  undermine  the  credibility  of  monetary 
policy,  destabilizing  inflationary  expectations,  and  weakening  the  effectiveness  of 
monetary policy. This is particularly important in the case of emerging economies with 
a shorter record of monetary stability.  
  Another reason that has been put forward to not try to affect asset prices through monetary 
policy is simply that it is impossible to determine when prices are significantly misaligned with 
their  fundamentals.  Although  I  agree  with  the  fact,  I  do  not  think  this  is  a  strong  reason. 
Indeed,  even  though  it  is  difficult  to  determine  when  prices  are  fundamentally  misaligned, 
policymakers should worry about this phenomenon. However, acting through monetary policy 
may not be the best option, and it is better to look more closely at financial regulation and 
how  to  limit  the  procyclicality  of  the  banking  system  and  build  enough  cushions  for  the 
downturn. This should also reduce fragilities that are generated during the upturn. 
Inflation targets, exchange rates and intervention 
3.  
An inflation-targeting regime, where the policy instrument is the interest rate, must operate 
within  a  context  of  a  flexible  exchange  rate.  This  solves  efficiently  and  unambiguously  the 
well-known impossible trinity for countries financially open, and allows the control of interest 
rates at a level consistent with the inflationary objective. Adding an exchange rate objective 
weakens  the  capacity  to  control  the  interest  rate,  affecting  the  ability  to  meet  the  inflation 
target. 
However,  the  exchange  rate  generally  has  effects  on  monetary  policy,  since  persistent 
movements  of  it  do  affect  inflation.  In  this  case,  the  natural  result  is a  leaning  against  the 
wind. When the exchange rate appreciates substantially, it prompts a fall in inflation in the 
medium term, which results in a reduction in the interest rate. This, in turn, induces pressures 
for  depreciation.  However,  one  must  recognize  that  these  are  not  very  significant  effects 
because, in a floating regime, the pass-through coefficient from the exchange rate to inflation 
is limited.4
Emerging economies may feel tempted, after a long history of crises caused by exchange 
rate  misalignments,  to  keep  their  currencies  depreciated.  Managing  the  exchange  rate  is, 
apart from hardly feasible in the medium to long term, risky. In the first place, in less flexible 
                                                 
4   For a recent discussion on the Chilean evidence see De Gregorio (2009b). 
BIS Review 113/2009

exchange  rate  regimes,  the  pass-through  from  exchange  rates  to  inflation  increases, 
because  the  level  of  the  exchange  rate  may  become  a  coordinator  of  price  expectations, 
given the policymakers’ commitment to exchange rate stability. This, in turn, feeds back to 
increased  pressures  to  keep  the  exchange  rate  stable,  thus  aggravating  the  problem. 
Secondly,  a  commitment  of  the  authority  with  exchange  rate  stability  may  create  perverse 
incentives to financial risk taking, by artificially lowering the cost of borrowing abroad. This 
reinforces  fear  of  floating  (Calvo  and  Reinhart,  2002),  creating  a  spiral  towards  exchange 
rate rigidity, and deriving in currency mismatches and exchange rate misalignments that the 
policies were intended to prevent in the first place.  
I am not saying that attention must not be paid to the exchange rate beyond its effects on 
inflation. The exchange rate is an important determinant of resource allocation, and hence, 
excessive deviations from fundamentals may create distortions. However, I think a sensible 
way  to  address  signs  of  severe  misalignments,  beyond  the  leaning  against  the  wind  with 
monetary  policy,  is  through  sterilized  intervention.  But,  in  order  for  this to  be  effective  and 
coherent with the inflation targeting framework, some conditions must be met: 
• 
In  the  first  place,  it  must  be  consistent  with  the  inflation  target,  in  order  for  the 
intervention not to jeopardize the credibility of monetary policy.  
Secondly,  to  safeguard  monetary  policy  independence,  once  the  intervention  is 
announced,  it  must  be  implemented  mechanically.  All  this  shields  the  conduct  of 
monetary  policy,  typically  carried  out  in  regular  pre-established  meetings,  from  the 
extraordinary  decision  of  buying  or  not  buying  foreign  currency.  In  particular,  the 
sterilization of intervention decisions permits to preserve both the credibility and the 
independent management of monetary policy.  
Finally,  and  because  of  this  sterilization  requisite,  the  cost  of  intervention  must  be 
properly  considered,  because  it  entails  a  quasi-fiscal  component  that  could  be 
significant. 
  The Chilean experience last year was in line with the aforesaid principles. It was done in a 
moment where there was clear evidence of misalignment with respect to the levels deemed 
consistent  with  long-term  fundamentals.  It  was  also  totally  consistent  with  the  inflation 
objective, and started at a moment – April 2008 – in which there were rather benign inflation 
figures that revealed a smaller risk of unwanted inflationary propagation. Towards midyear it 
was even possible to raise the interest rate substantially to tackle a surprise rise in inflation 
that was much deviated from the target. This was so thanks to the fact that the purchase of 
dollars was being carried out mechanically, despite a significantly depreciated exchange rate 
after the intervention. The purchase of foreign currency was concluded prematurely due to 
global  tensions  in  global  liquidity  in  dollars  in  September  of  last  year.  The  capacity  of  the 
Chilean  economy  to  subsequently  deal  with  a  significant  exchange  rate  depreciation,  with 
monetary  easing  prospects  and  reduced  inflationary  pressures,  is  proof  that  there  was  no 
inconsistency between the decision to intervene and the conduct of monetary policy (Figure 
2). It also shows that the flexible exchange rate regime adopted early this decade has the 
economy well prepared to absorb exchange rate fluctuations without the turmoil that used to 
come with them in the past. 
Bubbles, exchange rates and capital inflows in emerging economies 
4.  
Latin  America  went  through  a  period  of  large  capital  inflows  in  the  first  part  of  the  1990s 
(Calvo et al., 1996). We cannot disregard the possibility that after the current crisis is over, 
there  will  be  a  reemergence  of  inflows  to  emerging  economies.  Therefore,  there  could  be 
strong  pressures  for  a sharp  increase  in  the  valuation  of domestic  assets,  with  a  potential 
bubble in their prices, and this bubble could take the form of an exchange rate appreciation.  
4 
 BIS Review 113/2009
To begin this discussion, I should emphasize that capital inflows to capital-scarce economies 
are a good thing. We know that capital flows to institutionally strong economies are beneficial 
(Prasad et al., 2002). Therefore, the role of policy is not to impede capital flows, but to avoid 
the creation of a bubble in domestic assets with consequences on resource allocation.5 In 
this  regard,  to  have  in  place  sound  prudential  regulation  during  periods  of  abundance  of 
capital is essential for financial stability, as we are reminded by the crisis in Chile in the early 
1980s, the Mexican crisis of the mid-1990s, the Asian crisis, and more recently, the crisis in 
Eastern Europe. 
Even  if  one  could  accept  that  monetary  tightening  could  be  an  appropriate  response  to 
combat an asset price bubble such as the recent housing price bubble, with all the caveats I 
discussed before, the problem is more acute in small open economies. Tightening monetary 
policy may have perverse effects, since it induces further capital inflows and strengthens the 
currency.  In  this  case,  the  interest  rate  is  not  the  most  adequate  instrument  with  which  to 
burst the bubble.  
Indeed, the perverse dynamics are as follows: high interest rate differentials induce capital 
inflows  to  arbitrage  those  differences;  then  policymakers  strive  to  avoid  the  appreciation, 
which  in  general  is  thought  to  be  transitory,  since  the  sustainability  of  exchange  rate 
management  is  limited;  the  incentives  for  inflows  increase  as  not  only  the  interest  rate 
differential is large, but also the expectations of appreciation; finally, the appreciation takes 
place,  which  validates the  expectations  of  arbitrageurs.  This  process goes  for  a while  and 
may  be  accommodated  gradually  or  ended  by  a  sudden  stop.  In  this  process  there  are 
“excess” inflows and “excess appreciation”, and the issue is how to avoid those excesses.  
According to the simple dynamics I have just described a first line of defense to avoid excess 
fluctuations  of  capital  flows  is  to  maintain  exchange  rate  flexibility.  This  prevents  investors 
from  speculating  against  an  authority  that  will  be  defending  the  parity  only  transitorily. 
Moreover, by introducing volatility it increases the risks of a one sided bet on the exchange 
rate.  
An  inflation  commitment  may  also  help  to  stabilize  flows.  As  I  discussed  before,  massive 
inflows that appreciate the currencies will result in a loosening of monetary policy that should 
reduce  the  incentives  for  carry  trade.  In  contrast,  if  capital  inflows  generate  a  boom  of 
activity,  without  inflationary  consequences  due  to  the  appreciation  of  the  currency,  there 
could  be  the  temptation  to  tighten  monetary  policy,  aggravating  the  problem  of  massive 
inflows.  To  control  expenditure  without  increasing  pressures  on  the  exchange  rate,  fiscal 
policy should help.  
A  credible  inflation  target  with  a  flexible  exchange  rate  regime  should  help  to  avoid  the 
problems we faced during the 1990s. Indeed, during the period of large capital inflows, no 
monetary policy in Latin America operated under a full-fledge inflation targeting regime, and 
most countries had some form of exchange rate rigidity. 
Despite having a flexible exchange rate and an inflation target in place, the effects on the 
exchange  rate  could  reflect  that  domestic  asset  prices  could  be  forming  a  bubble.  In  this 
case, sterilized intervention, without an explicit objective on the level of exchange rate, can 
also  help.  I  already  discussed  some  principles  to  guide  sterilized  intervention  within  an 
inflation  targeting  framework.  A  much  debated  proposal  is  the  use  of  capital  controls.  The 
                                                 
5  
In  addition,  a  traditional  concern  is  that  with  the  same  speed  as  capital  flows  in,  capital  may  flow  out, 
generating costly adjustment processes. See Cowan et al. (2007) for a review of sudden starts and sudden 
stops around the world. Sudden stops of inflows are as common in developed as in emerging countries, but in 
the former, the sudden stop tends to be offset by a return of domestic capital invested abroad, while in the 
latter  it  results  in  a  severe  squeeze  in  the  capital  account.  Accumulation  of  reserves  or  another  form  of 
insurance should help to avoid large swings.

evidence  on  their  effectiveness  is  elusive.6  Effectiveness  is  also  severely  impaired  as 
domestic financial markets have reached some degree of development and integration with 
the  rest  of  the  world.  With  hindsight  from  the  current  crisis,  one  can think  that  rather  than 
controls, what is needed is a prudential regulatory framework to avoid speculation and high 
risk taking in the banking system. 
The rise and fall of inflation 
5.  
In  this  section  I  will  review  inflation  behavior  in  Chile,  a  country  that  had  the  sharpest 
increase in inflation among emerging economies in the run up of commodity prices, but also 
the largest decline since the crisis erupted (Figure 3). The most remarkable component of 
the  inflationary  process  of  2007-2008  was  how  strongly  the  increase  in  international  food 
prices  was  transmitted  domestically.  Inflation  rose  from  a  y-o-y  rate  of  2.6%  in  December 
2006 to 9.9% in October 2008. Then, it declined to -1.0% in August 2009. 
What accounts for the steep rise in inflation? It may partially be due to Chile’s high degree of 
commercial openness. There are practically no barriers to imports, no widespread protection 
of agriculture, nor any large-scale distortions in the market pricing mechanism, so changes in 
external  prices  are  quickly  reflected  in  the  domestic  market.  In  fact,  at  least  during  the 
greater part of 2007, growing inflation was mostly caused by increasing food prices, rather 
than by a widespread inflationary process (Figure 4).7  
The 2007-2008 food price shock was partially considered to be a one-off change in global 
relative  demand  and  supply,  such  as  the  increased  use  of  biofuels  that  should  have  no 
severe  medium-term  inflationary  implications.  However,  with  inflation  rising,  the  monetary 
policy  rate  (MPR)  was  raised  by  125  basis  points  in  the  second  half  of  2007,  in  order  to 
mitigate undesirable second-round effects of the supply shocks (Figure 5). 8
By early 2008, the inflationary situation was still a complex one, but risks had decreased, and 
inflation  was  expected  to  reach  its  target  thanks  to  the  monetary  policy  actions  already  in 
place, lower world growth and a strengthened peso. Trend inflation tempered and monetary 
policy remained unchanged. During this period we decided to initiate a process of reserve 
accumulation. Nevertheless, halfway through the second quarter of 2008, the inflation path 
radically  changed;  the  inflationary  trend  resumed,  unexpectedly,  with  monthly  inflation 
reaching more than 1%. The risks of inflation remaining above the target beyond the policy 
horizon  also  grew  strongly.  Consistently,  monetary  policy  also  had  a  strong  reaction.  The 
MPR was increased by 200 basis points in just four months. By September 2008, before the 
collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Central Bank estimated that it would be necessary to raise 
the MPR further, even above market expectations.  
Finally, inflation reached its 9.9% peak in October. It is still early to determine with a great 
degree  of  certainty  the  strong  and  sudden  propagation  of  foreign  shocks  on  domestic 
                                                 
6   For a review  of the Chilean  experience, see Cowan  and de Gregorio (2007). The only empirical study that 
found some effects of reducing the extent of the appreciation is Edwards and Rigobon (2009), however the 
magnitude  of  such  effect  is small,  since  the  elimination  of  capital  controls  from  its  maximum  would  have 
appreciated  the  exchange  rate  between  2  and  2.5%.  In  any  case,  it  is  useful  to  remind  that  the  most 
appreciated real exchange rate in the last 20 years in Chile occurred in 1997, year in which there were capital 
controls, massive reserve accumulation, an exchange rate band and high interest rates. 
7   Another factor underlying inflation pressures and a deceleration of growth was the higher cost of energy. Not 
only  had  thermoelectric  power  plants  to  operate  with  more  costly  inputs,  but  also  unfavorable  hydrological 
conditions and the shortage of natural gas implied that these more efficient sources of generation had to be 
replaced by diesel. 
8   For simulations on the monetary policy response to an oil shock see Desormeaux et al. (2009). They conclude 
that the response should be moderated when the shock is transitory and policy is credible. A much stronger 
response is suggested by Batini and Terenau (2009).

inflation.  Inflation  propagated  to  most  prices,  so  core  inflation  also  increased  sharply.  The 
output  gap  increased  slightly  during  the  third  quarter,9  although  domestic  demand  was 
growing strongly (Figure 6). The exchange rate did not add significant inflationary pressures. 
Perhaps,  the  sharp  increase  in  oil  prices  –  which  came  close  to  150  dollars  per  barrel  – 
caused a generalized rise in domestic prices. A strong demand and a large cost shock may 
have induced an unusual fraction of price-setters to adjust prices, despite the fact that the 
output  gap did  not change  significantly.  However,  if  this  had  been  the  case,  prices  should 
have  remained  more  stable  rather  than  experiencing  a  sharp  fall  after  commodity  prices 
started falling. 
As  in  most  of  the  world  economies,  financial  tensions  were  severe  after  the  collapse  of 
Lehman Brothers. Interest rates in both peso and dollar markets posted substantial increases 
in the most stressful times from mid-September to mid-October 2008 (Figure 7). The Central 
Bank  acted  quickly,  providing  peso  and  dollar  liquidity  facilities  to  the  financial  system  to 
ensure resource availability would foreign loans become scarce. These facilities, which will 
be  in  place  throughout  2009,  have  not  been  used  extensively  by  financial  institutions, 
reflecting their sustained access to external markets. This is an example of how monetary 
policy can react to mitigate financial turbulences without affecting the path of monetary policy 
considered to be consistent with the inflation target. 
Beyond  the  stressful  episodes  in  local  money  markets,  the  world  financial  crisis  and  its 
aftermaths  in  the  real  sector  have  caused  a  significant  drop  in  domestic  demand  and 
economic activity. Lending standards have certainly tightened, but the Chilean economy is 
far from suffering the problems that other countries are facing.  
Accordingly, the inflation outlook changed significantly, while monetary policy reacted with a 
change  that  was  large  in  magnitude  and  swift  in  implementation.  October  2008  was  the 
month  where  y-o-y  inflation  peaked.  November  brought  some  relief,  largely  determined  by 
the  drop  in  fuel  prices  in  world  markets.  By  then,  no  break  in  the  inflationary  trend  was 
foreseen.  Nonetheless,  given  the  weakening  outlook  for  activity  and  inflation,  the  Central 
Bank not only did not raise the MPR – which was the most likely path of monetary policy as 
discussed  in  September’s  Monetary  Policy  Report  presented  to  Congress  –  but  also 
communicated  that  the  most  likely  course  of  action  would  be  an  easing  of  policy  by  early 
2009.  
In January 2009, with a clearer assessment of the reduced inflationary pressures, the MPR 
was lowered by 100 basis points. Later, with the evidence of alleviated inflationary pressures 
and drastic increases in downward risks to growth and inflation, the Central Bank decided to 
cut the MPR by 250 basis points at both its meetings of February and March. The monetary 
easing  process  continued  and  completed  775  basis  points  in  seven  monthly  meetings, 
bringing the MPR to 0.50%, the minimum level deemed adequate for a normal functioning of 
money  markets.  In  addition,  the  Central  Bank  adopted  some  non-conventional  monetary 
policy measures, extending the overnight liquidity facility for banks at the MPR to 180 day 
tenors  and  cutting  the  issuance  of  1-  and  2-year  Central  Bank  bonds.  It  has  been  also 
announced that the MPR will be held constant at this minimum level for a prolonged period of 
time, and that it will use with flexibility all the monetary policy tools at hand, which goes way 
beyond setting the MPR every month. 
Several  lessons  and  challenges  arise  for  the  Chilean  experience.  First,  the  volatility  of 
inflation has been very large. This could be explained by the severity of the shocks hitting the 
economy,  but  this  is  not  so  clear  when  comparing  with  other  countries.  Although  it  was 
argued that indexation could be resuming and inflation would stay high, the turnaround was 
impressive,  and  hence,  it  is  not  clear  how  persistence  has  evolved,  and  it  is  difficult  to 
                                                 
9   The  output  gap  is  actual  output  minus  potential  output;  hence,  an  increase  refers  to  a  rise  above  potential 
output.

explain with a simple linear adjustment. It could be argued that the change in inflation is due 
to the impact on inflation of the widening of the output gap. However, the output gap changed 
little  when  inflation  was  rising,  and  the  current  decline  cannot  be  explained  by  the  current 
narrowing of the output gap.10 We used to think that the output gap, as a proxy for marginal 
cost, is what affects inflation, but the Chilean experience was more of a large swing in the 
growth  of  domestic  demand  rather  than  output.  However,  the  connection  from  domestic 
demand to inflation is less clear than that of the output gap. Finally, the degree of openness 
and  competition  in  the  Chilean  economy  may  increase  the  sensitivity  of  prices  to  demand 
conditions. More work would have to be done to fully understand the dynamics of inflation, 
but  still  the  inflation  targeting  framework  has  been  very  useful  to  conduct  monetary  policy 
and to stabilize inflationary expectations. 
Concluding remarks 
6.  
Although more often than not, central banks have an explicit financial stability objective, for 
many years, and within a context of strong GDP growth and sound balance sheets of banks 
and firms, this was a second-class issue. Now things have changed dramatically. As of last 
year, financial stability became the protagonist in monetary policy management in developed 
countries.11  
Central banks need to oversee price stability and financial stability. To pursue two objectives, 
one instrument, namely the interest rate, is not enough. Indeed, a well functioning financial 
system  strengthens  the  transmission  mechanism  of  monetary  policy.  There  may  be 
exceptional  occasions  in  which  both  objectives  may  collide,  for  example  when  monetary 
policy requires an increase in the interest rate, while financial stability calls for a reduction. 
Another example could be a bubble in the exchange rate with high inflation. In the context of 
monetary policy in an inflation targeting regime, those situations could be accommodated by 
escape clauses. But, more in general both objectives should be addressed with more than 
one instrument. 
The overall purpose of financial stability is to ensure the proper functioning of markets and to 
avoid having to arrive at the degrees of turbulence and dislocation we have witnessed in the 
past  year.  For  this  reason,  financial  regulation  plays  a  major  role  in  granting  financial 
integrity.  At  the  beginning,  regulation  focused  on  the  strength  of  individual  institutions. 
However, the tensions we have seen show how individual fragility may quickly evolve into 
systemic  problems.  The  interrelationships  among  financial  institutions  and  the  proper 
operation  of  the  markets  where  liquidity  is  traded  are  essential  ingredients  of  a  market 
economy, but these characteristics are also the channels of financial contagion, as recently 
seen.  So  it  is  crucial  to  have  a  systemic  vision,  not  only  from  the  perspective  of  how  the 
different institutions relate to each other, but also on how the different types of financial and 
operating risks are intertwined, creating potential vulnerabilities. 
Regarding price stability, conducting monetary policy within an inflation targeting scheme is 
appropriate, and recent experience shows that it may provide ample room for expansionary 
policies when facing a global recession such as the current one. There will be a long debate 
and a number of research papers on the proper mechanism to secure financial stability and 
how  it  should  be  combined  with  monetary  policy  management.  However,  the  current 
                                                 
10   For  example,  the  output  gap  fell  between  8  to  10  percentage  points,  which  could  explain,  without  lags,  a 
decline  of  about  3  to  4  percentage  points  in  inflation,  by  applying  textbook  Phillips  curve  or  more  complex 
estimations  (Brayton  and  Tinsley,  1996)  for  the  US,  which  are  not  very  different  from  those  of  Chile.  The 
actual decline in inflation in Chile has been about 10 percentage points. 
11   The Fed does not have an explicit financial stability objective, although its role in this matter is widely known. 
See, for example, Plosser (2007).

experience  in  many  emerging  markets  is  a  demonstration  that  the  objectives  of  financial 
stability and price stability can be preserved even under extreme tensions.  
In  sum,  conducting  monetary  policy  through  an  inflation  targeting  regime,  with  flexible 
exchange  rate,  clear  mechanics  for  exceptional  sterilized  intervention  only  when  there  are 
clear signs of misalignments, a countercyclical fiscal rule, and a strong financial regulatory 
framework  has  worked  quite  well  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  the  worst  crisis  the  world  has 
faced in several decades.
