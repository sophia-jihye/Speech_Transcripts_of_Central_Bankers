Ric Battellino: Mining booms and the Australian economy 
Address  by  Mr  Ric  Battellino,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Australia,  to  The 
Sydney Institute, Sydney, 23 February 2010.  
 Introduction 
The topic of my talk tonight is “Mining Booms and the Australian Economy”. I have chosen 
this  topic  because  the  Australian  economy  is  currently  experiencing  a  surge  in  mining 
activity,  one  of  a  sequence  of  mining  booms  since  the  European  settlement  of  Australia. 
These have been a powerful force in shaping the Australian economy.  
Tonight I want to review the effects of these booms. Of particular interest is the question of 
whether there are recurring themes from which we can draw lessons on how to manage the 
current episode. 
My talk is based on research by a couple of my colleagues from the Bank which draws on 
the work of several economic historians.1 I won’t take time to list these references now, but 
they are shown at the end of the version of my talk on the Bank’s website.

Mining booms in Australia 
The distinguishing features of a mining boom are significant increases in mining investment 
or  mining  output,  usually  both,  which  go  on 
important  macroeconomic 
consequences. 
On this basis, I think we can identify five major mining booms during the past two hundred 
years or so. These are: 
 
 


 
the 1850s gold rush;  
the late 19th century mineral boom; 
the 1960s/early 1970s mineral and energy boom; 
the late 1970s/early 1980s energy boom; and 
the current episode, which is again both a mineral and energy boom.

 There have also been quite a number of other mini booms in mining activity, but given the 
time available I am going to limit myself to the five episodes I have just noted. 
I will start with a brief summary of the causes, characteristics and consequences of each of 
the  booms,  and  then  provide  a  more  general  assessment  of  their  macroeconomic 
implications. 
The 1850s gold rush 
(a) 
The 1850s gold rush was the first major mining boom in Australia. Economic historians note 
that  the  timing  of  these  gold  discoveries  may  have  been  related  to  international 
developments  such  as  the  California  gold  rush  of  the  late  1840s,  which  had  heightened 
general  interest  in  gold  exploration  and  mining.  The  first  well  publicised  find  of  gold  in 
Australia, near Bathurst in New South Wales, was by a veteran of the California gold rush. 
Domestic  economic  developments  may  also  have  influenced  the  timing,  as  the  continuing 
effects of the 1840s recession meant that labour in Australia was abundant and mobile, and 
therefore more likely to become involved in prospecting.2 
This  boom  ended  up  being  mainly  centred  on  the  gold  fields  of  Victoria.  It  was  atypical 
compared  with  later  booms  in  that  it  was  not  accompanied  by  a  large  increase  in  mining 
investment.  At  that  stage,  large  amounts  of  capital  were  not  readily  available  and,  in  any 
case, the form of mining that was taking place – surface alluvial mining – was well suited to 
large inputs of labour and little input of capital.  
The boom lasted for about a decade and a half; by the mid 1860s, the gold rushes of Victoria 
had largely faded. 
Measured  in  terms  of  value  added  to  GDP,  this  boom  greatly  exceeded  all  subsequent 
mining  booms.  At  its  peak  in  1852,  mining  comprised  about  35  per  cent  of  GDP.3  This 
created tremendous upheavals in the economy at the time. The value of exports from New 
South Wales and Victoria rose by a factor of six in three years, and exports of gold exceeded 
wool exports for the following 18 years.4

Labour flowed strongly to the gold states, particularly Victoria, and Melbourne became the 
largest city in Australia. Some of this flow of labour came from other states. For example, the 
male  populations  of  South  Australia  and  Tasmania  fell  by  3  per  cent  and  17  per  cent 
respectively  in  1852.  But  a  large  amount  of  labour  also  came  from  sharply  increased 
immigration; the Australian population almost trebled during a 10-year period.5 
Wages  rose  sharply,  at  first  in  mining,  then  across  the  country  as  labour  flowed  to  the 
diggings. Between 1850 and 1853, wages in Victoria rose by 250 per cent.6 
Colonial  governments  had  no  powers  over  the  money  supply  or  the  exchange  rate.7  The 
money supply trebled in the space of a couple of years. All the adjustment in the economy 
took place via inflation. The rise in inflation meant that by the middle of the boom the real 
exchange rate was about 50 per cent higher than at the start.  
There was evidence of what we now call the “Dutch disease” – i.e. damage to some non-
mining industries because of the difficulty of retaining labour, increased costs and the high 
real  exchange  rate.8  For  example,  shepherds’  wages  doubled  between  1850  and  1853, 
creating difficulty for the wool industry and wool exports grew at much reduced rates. Also, 
according  to  one  data  source,  the  number  of  manufacturing  establishments  in  New  South 
Wales fell from 165 in 1850 to 140 a couple of years later.9 
The overall impact on economic activity was, however, highly positive. Confidence was high, 
the  flow  of  immigration  greatly  boosted  demand  for  goods  and  services,  and  industries 
servicing  the  mines  –  e.g.  sawmilling,  brick-making  and  transport  –  all  boomed.  Parts  of 
agriculture  also  benefited  from  greatly  increased  demand  for  food.  The  infrastructure 
provided  to  service  the  mines  –  such  as  extensive  road-building  –  went  on  to  have  many 
positive effects in terms of opening up agricultural land. GDP growth remained very strong 
for a decade after the boom peaked.10 
Despite having a new source of tax and licence revenue, governments faced pressures in 
their finances, both because of strong demand for infrastructure spending and sharply rising 
costs  of  providing  it.  In  1853,  for  example,  the  Victorian  Government  spent  £520  000  on 
roads,  compared  with  £11  000  two  years  earlier.11  Governments  therefore  resorted  to 
borrowing, which they did through London markets. They found this relatively easy to do, as 
the discovery of gold had made the colonies more creditworthy. 
The late 19th century mineral boom 
(b) 
The second boom was that in the late 19th century. 
This  boom  was  driven  by  the  discovery  and  development  of  new  gold  and  metal  mines 
across  the  country,  but  particularly  in  Western  Australia,  Queensland  and  western  New 
South  Wales.  Partly  this  was  the  natural  consequence  of  the  spread  of  the  population  to 
more  remote  areas,  but  partly  it  reflected  capital  market  developments.  There  was  ample 
capital available in London to fund exploration activities as the recession in the early 1890s 
had  led  to  a  fall  in  investment  opportunities.  Also  the  development  of  the  “no-liability”

company  made  it  much  easier  to  access  this  capital.  In  1894,  94  Western  Australian 
companies  had  been  floated  in  London;  two  years  later  there  were  690.12  Sadly  for  the 
British investors, much of this money was never repaid in dividends, an indication of the risks 
that can be involved in mining investment. 
The main part of this boom took place against a very subdued economic background, both in 
Australia and in the major economies. The financial collapses that occurred after the bursting 
of the 1880s property bubble had led to a global depression with very large falls in output and 
high unemployment. 
The continuing effects of that financial collapse meant that this boom, somewhat unusually, 
was not accompanied by a sharp acceleration in money supply growth. Similarly, the large 
amount of spare capacity in the economy  meant that there was significant deflation at the 
start of the boom, which limited the subsequent peak in inflation. 
There were some pressures on wages as the unemployment rate fell sharply from the very 
high levels of the early 1890s, and there were signs of rising industrial disputation. The real 
exchange rate, however, did not move much through this episode.13 
The  current  account,  which  had  moved  to  a  very  large  deficit  during  the  1880s  property 
bubble (13 per cent of GDP) moved back to a more normal small deficit in the 1890s, and 
eventually into surplus when the mining boom ended and the economy slowed in the early 
1900s.14 
The  inter-regional  effects  of  the  boom,  as  in  the  1850s,  were  very  powerful.  There  were 
strong flows of labour to the new mine sites. The population of Western Australia increased 
from 48 000 to 180 000 during the 1890s; and the population of Broken Hill grew from 6 000 
in 1888 to almost 20 000 in 1891. Charters Towers had its own stock exchange.15 
There  were  also  significant  shifts  in  industrial  composition.  Exports  of  wool  and  grains 
stagnated and metals took over as Australia’s leading export.16  
Eventually,  the  combination  of  rising  costs  and  falling  profits  meant  that  capital  dried  up, 
investment fell, and the boom ended. Some of the policy actions taken at that time – such as 
the imposition of tariffs to protect urban industries – had powerful long-run influences.17 
The 1960s/early 1970s boom 
(c) 
The third boom was that in the 1960s/early 1970s. This boom was quite broadly based, but 
the key parts were sharp increases in mining of coal and iron ore, and the development of oil 
and bauxite discoveries. 
The  background  to  this  boom  was  that  both  the  global  and  domestic  economies  were 
becoming  increasingly  stretched,  with  rising  commodity  prices  and  rising  inflation  more 
generally.  Particularly  important  for  Australia  during  this  period  was  the  economic 
development  of  Japan.  As  well  as  adding  to  the  global  demand  for  resources,  this  had 
particular  significance  for  Australia  because  Japan’s  proximity  lowered  transport  costs  and 
made certain mineral discoveries economically viable.

 BIS Review 20/2010
This boom differed from the episodes in the 19th century in that it was more capital intensive. 
Partly  this  reflected  supply  factors,  as  global  capital  markets  had  developed  significantly 
since the turn of the century. Partly it was also technological, as some of the resources could 
only  be  developed  with  large-scale  investment.  Mining  investment  rose  from  about  ½  per 
cent of GDP in 1960 to a peak of almost 3 per cent in the early 1970s. 
Export  prices  rose  strongly,  particularly  in  the  early  1970s,  resulting  in  a  large  swing  in 
income  towards  exporters.  The  current  account  of  the  balance  of  payments  moved  to 
surplus, an outcome that has not been repeated since.  
Employment grew strongly in the second half of the 1960s, by close to 3 per cent per annum, 
due to large-scale immigration and increased female participation. Wages rose strongly, and 
the centralised wage fixing system spread the increases widely through the community. 
The nominal exchange rate remained relatively fixed until towards the end of the boom, the 
eventual appreciation of the exchange rate in the early 1970s coming too late to benefit the 
economy. Money supply growth picked up to over 20 per cent per annum in the early 1970s 
and fiscal policy also became expansionary. Inflation rose sharply. 
Tariff cuts were introduced in 1973 to help control inflation, but the benefit of this was later 
offset by the imposition of import quotas to try to protect manufacturing jobs. 
By the mid 1970s, both the Australian economy and the global economy were experiencing 
severe  difficulties,  primarily  flowing  from  the  adverse  consequences  of  very  high  inflation. 
The  boom  therefore  ended;  mining  investment  fell  to  low  levels,  and  commodity  prices 
stagnated. 
The late 1970s/early 1980s boom 
(d) 
The fourth major boom was in the late 1970s/early 1980s. This boom was largely driven by 
the energy sector, in particular steaming coal, oil and gas. This followed the second of the oil 
price shocks in the late 1970s. In addition, the increased cost of energy made Australia an 
attractive place for energy-intensive activities such as aluminium smelting. 
Investment in mining started to pick up in the late 1970s and increased sharply in 1981 and 
1982. 
This  mining  boom  led  to  a  sense  of  euphoria  about  Australia’s  future  which  was 
accompanied  by  a  resurgence  of  wage  demands  and  rising  inflation.  Monetary  and  fiscal 
policies were tightened but did not succeed in keeping the economy in check.  
The exchange rate system at that time involved management of the Australian dollar against 
a  trade-weighted  index  of  currencies.  The  authorities  followed  a  policy  of  appreciating  the 
exchange rate, but, with the benefit of hindsight, the rate of appreciation was relatively mild 
and did little to insulate the Australian economy from rising inflationary pressures. 
The boom was relatively short-lived. The downturn in the global economy in 1981, following 
the oil price shock, meant that demand for energy ended up being much less than had been 
expected; this was reflected in both the volume and the prices of exports. At the same time, 
the  distortions  caused  by  high  wage  growth  and  inflation,  and  the  resulting  tight  policies, 
meant that by 1982/83 the domestic economy had followed the global economy into a severe 
recession. 
The current boom 
(e) 
This brings me to the surge in mining investment that is currently under way. This is again 
very  broad  based  across  a  range  of  resources,  but  the  core  part  centres  on  the  large 
expansion in the iron ore, coal and gas industries. It has been, to a large degree, driven by 
demand for resources by emerging economies, with China being the most significant. 
BIS Review 20/2010

   Judged by the pattern in mining investment and commodity prices, the start of this boom can 
be dated from around 2005. By 2007 and early 2008, it was severely testing the productive 
capacity and flexibility of the economy. That all changed in the second half of 2008, as the 
effects of the mining boon were offset by the impact of the global financial crisis. However, 
now that this has passed, the underlying dynamics of the resource boom are starting to re-
appear.  
Many of the characteristics of this episode have been similar to those of earlier booms, but 
there are a few key differences worth noting: 
 
First,  mining  investment  as  a  share  of  GDP  has  been  significantly  higher  than 
recorded in previous booms and is thought likely to rise further. In terms of additions 
to output, the contribution of mining this time has been larger than that during the 
booms of the 1960s and 1970s, but still below that of the late 19th century and much 
lower than that in the 1850s. 
Second,  the  terms  of  trade  have  risen  much  more  than  they  did  in  earlier  mining 
booms.  The  current  level  of  the  terms  of  trade  rivals  the  sharp  peaks  that  were 
associated  with  rises  in  wool  prices  following  the  First  World  War  and  during  the 
Korean War. The current mining boom has seen both the volume and the price of 
resource exports rise strongly. 
Third, this is the first boom during which the exchange rate has been floating, and in 
which a significant rise in the nominal exchange rate has been an important part of 
the  economic  adjustment.  This  has  added  an  important  degree  of  flexibility  to  the 
economy,  by  allowing  the  real  exchange  rate  to  rise  through  a  means  other  than 
inflation. 
 How long the current surge in mining activity will continue is uncertain. Past booms do not 
seem to have lasted more than about 15 years before resource depletion, or international or 
domestic developments, acted to slow economic activity and bring the boom to an end. On 
this occasion, the growth potential of countries such as China and India suggests that the 
expansion  in  resource  demand  could  continue  for  an  extended  period,  though  this  will 
depend  at  least  to  some  extent  on  the  economic  management  skills  of  the  authorities  in 
these countries, not to mention our own.

 BIS Review 20/2010
Assessment 
The booms that I have described took place over a period of about 160 years, and against 
very different backgrounds. Yet, some similarities come through.  
The first point that stands out is the important role played by global events in causing mining 
booms in Australia. In some cases this was due to the effect on prospecting activity (e.g. the 
impact  of  the  California  gold  rush  in  the  1850s  boom  and  the  availability  of  international 
capital to fund the 1890s boom); in some cases it was due to a change in the relative prices 
of  commodities  on  global  markets  (e.g.  the  late  1970s  boom);  and  in  others  due  to  the 
emergence  of  powerful  new  trading  partners  (e.g.  the  development  of  Japan  in  the  1960s 
and the development of China and India recently). 
The second point is that the overall impact of each boom was to strengthen the economy. 
Increased  investment  in  mining,  higher  income  from  mining  activities,  and  the  need  for 
increased  infrastructure  to  service  the  mines  all  worked  in  this  direction.  Also,  each  boom 
had  high,  or  increasing,  population  growth  in  its  early  years  which  added  to  the  economic 
momentum. Not everybody benefited from that economic pick-up and some industries went 
into decline due to the difficulty in competing for workers with the newly expanding sectors. 
The third point that seems clear from history is that every mining boom was accompanied by 
increased inflationary pressure. Sometimes this was part of a global story, sometimes it was 
due to wage behaviour, but the general factor was pressure on the productive resources of 
the economy due to the expansion of economic activity. Leaving aside the current episode, 
only  in  the  1890s  boom,  which  began  when  the  economy  had  large-scale  spare  capacity, 
was the rise in inflation contained to single digits. 
One interesting issue is the role of the exchange rate in these booms. Theory suggests that 
part of the adjustment process for an economy experiencing a mining boom is a rise in the 
real exchange rate in order to facilitate the flow of real resources that is needed. In all the 
previous  booms,  however,  the  nominal  exchange  rate  was  either  fixed  or  managed  very 
tightly. The real exchange rate could therefore only adjust through inflation. 
In the current episode, with a floating rate, the behaviour of the nominal exchange rate has 
been very different from the past. It has risen early in the boom and by a large amount. This 
has been an important factor helping to dissipate inflationary pressures. 
BIS Review 20/2010

Conclusion 
Let me conclude. 
History tells us that mining booms are periods of significant economic change and that they 
can  pose  complex  challenges  for  policy  makers.  Key  among  these  is  the  need  to  ensure 
flexibility in the economy and maintain disciplined macroeconomic policies in order to contain 
the inflationary forces generated by the boom.  
History also shows that, in the past, these challenges proved to be quite difficult to deal with. 
However, in the 30 years since the previous boom, the Australian economy has developed in 
ways  that  should  make  it  better  able  to  accommodate  the  surge  in  mining  activity  that  is 
currently under way. The floating exchange rate is a key difference, but goods and labour 
markets are also more flexible, and the monetary and fiscal policy frameworks are now more 
soundly  based.  This  gives  grounds for  confidence  that  we  can  do  better  this  time,  but  the 
task will not be without challenges.
