Lars E O Svensson: Why a lower repo rate path? 
Speech by Prof Lars E O Svensson, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Umeå 
University, Umeå, 24 February 2010. 
 The opinions expressed herein are my own and are not necessarily shared by other members of the Riksbank’s 
Executive Board or staff. I would like to thank Hans Dillén, Karolina Ekholm, Per Jansson, Pernilla Meyersson, 
Staffan Viotti and Svante Öberg for their valuable comments. Hanna Armelius has contributed to this speech. 
In this speech, I would like to explain why I entered a reservation the most recent monetary 
policy meeting and justify why I preferred a lower repo rate. I will also explain why I consider 
that mean squared gaps should be used, to a greater extent, as a measure of the extent to 
which monetary policy has succeeded in stabilising inflation around the inflation target and 
resource utilisation around a normal level. Such measures entail a new step towards a more 
transparent and systematic monetary policy. 
The  Sveriges  Riksbank  Act  and  the  preparatory  work  for  it  specify  that  monetary  policy 
should  be  directed  towards  stabilising  inflation  around  the  inflation  target  and  resource 
utilisation around a normal level. The lower repo rate path I advocated at the most recent 
monetary  policy  meeting  would  provide  a  better  outcome  for  both  inflation  and  resource 
utilisation, with both higher resource utilisation and CPIF inflation closer to the target. Such 
an interest rate path would not entail any problems for financial stability or the functionality of 
the financial markets. Housing prices and mortgages do not comprise stability problems and 
should not affect monetary policy. Any future problems on the housing markets, or, indeed, 
any  future  problems  with  financial  stability  whatsoever,  can  best  be  managed  through 
regulation and supervision. The repo rate is an altogether too blunt and unsuitable instrument 
to  be  used  for  any  other  purpose  than  stabilising  inflation  around  the  inflation  target  and 
resource utilisation around a normal level. 
Monetary policy should be directed towards stabilising both inflation and resource 
utilisation 
According  to  the  Sveriges  Riksbank  Act,  “the  objective  for  monetary  policy  is  to  maintain 
price  stability”.  The  objective  is  thus  price  stability.  The  Riksbank  has  specified  this  as  an 
inflation  target  of  2  per  cent.  This  means  that  monetary  policy  should  stabilise  inflation 
around the inflation target. 
Furthermore, in the preparatory work for the Sveriges Riksbank Act (Prop. 1997/98:40), it is 
stated that “as an authority under the Riksdag, the Riksbank, without prejudice to the price 
stability market, should furthermore support the goals of general economic policy with a view 
to maintaining a sustainable level of growth and high rate of employment”. How should this 
be interpreted? What is the best contribution monetary policy can make towards maintaining 
a  sustainable  level  of  growth  and  high  rate  of  employment?  It  is  to  stabilise  resource 
utilisation around a normal level.  
Considering  the  price  stability  objective  stipulated  in  the  Sveriges  Riksbank  Act  and  the 
stance  taken  in  the  preparatory  work,  it  can  be  concluded  that  monetary  policy  should  be 
aimed  at  stabilising  inflation  around  the  inflation  target  and  resource  utilisation  around  a 
normal  level.  This  is  called  flexible  inflation-targeting  in  the  terminology  I  proposed  in  a 
number of papers published in the 1990s (Svensson 1999). This is, incidentally, completely 
in line with the stance adopted by the parliamentary Committee on Finance in 2007, in its 
comments  on  the  evaluation  of  monetary  policy  in  the  period  1995–2005  by  Francesco 
Giavazzi  and  Frederic  Mishkin  (2006/07:FiU27):  “The  Committee  maintains  that  Swedish 
monetary  policy  should  be  conducted  in  a  flexible  way  and  should  aim  to  stabilise  the 
development of inflation, employment and production.”

This being so, some people may wonder: Wouldn’t it be better to have a level of resource 
utilisation  that  is  higher  than  normal?  Shouldn’t  monetary  policy  be  aimed  at  achieving  a 
higher  level  of  resource  utilisation  than  normal?  Well,  you  may  think  so  –  but  40  years  of 
practical  experience  and  30  years  of  theoretical  and  empirical  research  have  produced 
overwhelming evidence that monetary policy alone cannot bring about a higher than normal 
level of resource utilisation. Making attempts through a more expansionary monetary policy 
will not lead to success in increasing resource utilisation and employment. The only result to 
be achieved will be higher inflation than desired – that is to say that, on average, the inflation 
target  will  be  exceeded.  Consequently,  for  monetary  policy,  the  highest  level  of  resource 
utilisation  that  is  sustainable  over  the  longer  term  is  the  normal  level.  Other  economic 
policies than monetary policy, such as labour market policy and structural policies improving 
the workings of the economy and the degree of competition, are needed to raise production 
and employment above the level that today is normal for these variables.  
Consequently, if the inflation target is given priority, a higher than normal level of resource 
utilisation cannot be sought in monetary policy. Some people may believe that priority to the 
inflation target may entail ignoring the real economy entirely and only caring about stabilising 
inflation. This is an altogether too narrow approach and characterises a so-called “inflation 
nutter”,  to  use  Mervyn  King’s  striking  expression.  It  is  called  strict  inflation  targeting  in  the 
terminology I proposed.1 Giving priority to the inflation target does not, therefore, mean that 
monetary policy should not stabilise resource utilisation, but, instead, that it should stabilise 
resource utilisation around a normal level, rather than a higher one.  
The  same  concept  can  be  expressed  with  different  words.  When  it  comes  to  the  average 
level  of  inflation  and  resource  utilisation,  there  is  only  one  numerical  target,  namely  the 
inflation target. There is no independent numerical target for resource utilisation. Rather, the 
average level for production and employment is determined by the workings of the economy, 
not  by  monetary  policy.  When  it  comes  to  the  stability  around  these  levels,  there  is  an 
objective  for  both,  namely  that  of  stabilising  both  as  much  as  possible,  and  of  trying  to 
achieve a reasonable balance between stability in inflation and resource utilisation when it is 
not possible to stabilise both completely. 
As  far  as  I  am  aware,  this  interpretation  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank  Act  and  its  preparatory 
work is now generally accepted. 
A lower repo rate path achieves a better outcome for inflation and resource utilisation 
At the most recent monetary policy meeting, I shared the view in the monetary policy report 
regarding economic developments in Sweden and abroad, but I expressed a reservation in 
favour of a lower repo rate path than that presented in the main scenario. I argued that a 
lower  interest  rate  path  will  lead  to  a  much  better  outcome  for  inflation  and  resource 
utilisation  without  causing  any  problems  to  the  functioning  of  the  financial  markets  or  to 
financial stability. How did I arrive at this stance?  
If a conflict should arise between stabilising inflation and stabilising resource utilisation, then 
a well-balanced monetary policy involves a reasonable compromise between the stability of 
inflation and the stability of resource utilisation. If there is no such conflict, things are much 
simpler.  Then  it  is  merely  a  question  of  finding  the  repo  rate  path  that  will  stabilise  both 
inflation and resource utilisation. In the current situation it can actually be claimed that there 
is no conflict.  
                                                 
1   The  designation  “inflation  nutter”,  describing  a  central  bank  only  working  towards  stabilising  inflation,  was 
coined in a speech held by Mervyn King at a conference at Gerzensee, Switzerland in 1995, later published as 
King (1997). The designations strict and flexible inflation targeting were first introduced and defined, as far as I 
know,  in  a  speech  I  held  at  a  conference  at  the  Banco  de  Portugal  in  1996,  later  published  as  Svensson 
(1999).

 To determine which repo rate path is most appropriate, a comparison must be made of the 
forecast  for  inflation  and  resource  utilisation  for  alternative  repo  rate  paths.  Such  a 
comparison is presented in Figures 2.13–2.15 at the end of Chapter 2 of the Monetary Policy 
Report. I present a similar comparison here in Figure 1. 
Figure 1 shows the consequences of alternative repo rate paths for the forecast for inflation 
and resource utilisation. The different repo rate paths are shown in panel a. In the middle is 
the  main  scenario’s  repo  rate  path  –  the  repo  rate  path  that  the  Executive  Board  majority 
chose at the meeting in February. Panel d shows the equivalent forecasts for CPIF inflation.2 
Panels e and f show equivalent forecasts for two measures of resource utilisation, the output 
gap in panel e and the hours gap in panel f. 
                                                 
2   One may ask why CPIF should be focused on and not CPI. In a situation in which extensive repo rate changes 
have very large direct effects on CPI, I consider it to be more appropriate to focus on stabilising CPIF around 
the inflation target, instead of CPI.

Panels b and c in Figure 1 also show the mean squared gaps, which were introduced in an 
article in the Monetary Policy Report in October 2009.3 The mean squared gap for inflation 
measures  the  deviation  between  the  inflation  forecast  and  the  inflation  target  or,  more 
precisely, the mean squared gap between the inflation forecast and the inflation target during 
the  forecast  period.  A  lower  mean  squared  gap  for  inflation  entails  a  forecast  of  inflation 
closer to the inflation target, that is a better stabilisation of inflation around the inflation target. 
The  mean  squared  gap  for  resource  utilisation,  measured  as  the  output  gap  or  the  hours 
gap,  measures  the  deviation  between  the  forecast  for  resource  utilisation  and  normal 
resource utilisation – more precisely, as the average squared gap during the forecast period. 
A  lower  mean  squared  gap  for  resource  utilisation  thus  entails  a  better  stabilisation  of 
resource utilisation around a normal level.

The gaps for output and hours worked are calculated as the difference between actual and 
“potential”  levels.  The  Riksbank’s  estimates  and  forecasts  for  potential  output  and  hours 
worked  are  inadequate  and  in  great  need  of  improvement  and  development.4  Such 
development  work  is  currently  underway.  These  measurements  of  resource  utilisation  are 
thus not particularly reliable. However, according to all available measurements, there is no 
doubt that resource utilisation is and will remain very low during the forecast period. Other 
forecasters’ output gap forecasts are shown in Figure 2. Several of the forecasts from other 
forecasters indicate an even lower level of resource utilisation than the Riksbank’s estimate.

 In the Monetary Policy Reports, the following note is also usually attached to the resource utilisation diagram. 
“These  gaps  should  not  necessarily  be  interpreted  as  the  Riksbank’s  overall  assessment  of  resource 
utilisation.” 
BIS Review 22/2010
Figure 1 here or Figures 2.13–2.15 in the Monetary Policy Report summarise the essence of 
the monetary policy decision. What monetary policy alternative shall we choose? Which repo 
rate path shall we choose: the one in the main scenario, or a higher or lower repo rate path?  
My  firm  opinion  is  that  a  large  part  of  the  monetary  policy  decision-making  process  and 
discussion  should  centre  on  monetary  policy  alternatives  and  their  advantages  and 
disadvantages.  I  fear  that  the  decision  process  will  otherwise  fix  too  quickly  and  too 
uncritically  on  one  particular  alternative  instead  of  carefully  and  meticulously  considering 
several alternatives, choosing the best one, and very clearly describing why one particular 
interest  rate  decision  was  made  and  not  another.  As  the  Riksdag  Committee  on  Finance 
states in its report in 2007: “A flexible monetary policy requires, in the Committee’s view, a 
high degree of transparency and that the Riksbank is very clear about why the various repo 
rate decisions have been made. This is also a prerequisite for the possibility to examine and 
evaluate monetary policy.” In my opinion, this requires a methodical and detailed discussion 
of the various monetary policy alternatives, together with the reason why one of them should 
be preferable to the others. 
The effects of a changed repo rate path on the forecast for inflation and resource utilisation 
are calculated with the help of the Riksbank’s model Ramses. In particular, they have been 
calculated using so-called expected deviations from the main scenario’s repo rate path. This 
corresponds  to  a  situation  in  which  the  Riksbank  clearly  and  transparently  announces  an 
alternative repo rate path that it intends to follow and that affects market expectations and 
thus inflation and the real economy.5 
The deviations from the main scenario’s repo rate path that are shown in these graphs entail 
a reduction or an increase in the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points over four quarters. After 
this, the alternative repo rate paths gradually return to the main scenario’s repo rate path in 
accordance with the Riksbank’s historically-estimated reaction function. 
Figure 3 shows the consequences, expressed as a percentage or percentage per year, of a 
reduction  of  the  repo  rate  path  by  0.25  percentage  points  over  four  quarters  on  quarterly 
inflation,  the  real  repo  rate,  the  real  exchange  rate,  four-quarter  inflation,  production  and 
hours worked. The solid curves show the effect of an anticipated reduction, while the dashed 
curves show the effect of an unanticipated reduction.6 We see that, all else being equal, such 
an  anticipated  reduction  of  the  repo  rate  leads  to  an  increase  in  inflation  of  just  over 
0.4 percentage points, an increase in output and the output gap of just over 0.4 per cent or 
percentage  points,  respectively,  and  an  increase  of  the  number  of  hours  worked  of 
approximately 0.35 per cent. If employment varies one-to-one with hours worked, which is 
realistic in a year or a couple of years’ time, employment will then increase by approximately 
0.35 per cent.  
                                                 
5   One  can  also  calculate  the  alternative  forecasts  for  inflation  and  resource  utilisation  using  so-called 
unexpected deviations from the main scenario’s repo rate path. This corresponds to a remarkable situation in 
which the Riksbank misleadingly announces the main scenario’s repo rate path but plans in a later monetary 
policy decision to surprise the market and the economic agents by deviating from the announced repo rate 
path. This would be the opposite of the transparent and clear monetary policy that the Riksbank says that it 
should conduct and does conduct. It is therefore reasonable to calculate the alternative forecasts for inflation 
and the real economy on the basis of expected deviations from the main scenario. The effects of expected 
deviations are somewhat greater than the effects of unexpected deviations. Figures 2.13–2.15 in the Monetary 
Policy Report are calculated using unexpected deviations. 
6   The effects of anticipated and unanticipated deviations are calculated using the methods presented in Laséen 
and Svensson (2009) and Leeper and Zha (2003), respectively.

0.35 per cent of an estimated potential employment rate of, conservatively, 93 per cent of a 
labour force of approximately five million is equivalent to over 16 000 jobs. Calculating on the 
basis of 93 per cent thus entails assuming a rather high figure for long-term unemployment of 
7  percent.  An  increase  of  over  16  000  jobs  is  thus  not  very  far  from  the  middle  of  the 
preliminary range of 10 000 to 25 000 jobs saved that I mentioned at the Monetary Policy 
Meeting in October. To sum up, a reduction of the repo rate path by 0.25 percentage points 
6 
 BIS Review 22/2010
over  four  quarters  will  thus  give,  all  else  being  equal,  an  increase  in  inflation  of  just  over 
0.4 percentage points and, if employment varies one-to-one with hours worked, an increase 
in employment of approximately 0.35 per cent, which is equivalent to an estimated figure of 
over 16 000 jobs. 
We see in Figure 3 that the consequences of an unanticipated reduction of the repo rate are 
less  than  those  of  an  anticipated  reduction.  In  such  a  case,  hours  worked  increase  by 
0.23 per cent, equivalent to just under 11 000 jobs, when calculated on the same basis.  
These  estimates  are  unbiased  estimates  and  forecasts  of  the  effects  of  a  lower  repo  rate 
path. The actual effect may be larger or smaller. It is possible that the effects of the repo rate 
on  the  economy  are  smaller  than  normal  when  the  repo  rate  is  close  to  zero.  It  is  also 
possible that a reduction of the repo rate path, in a situation in which the market’s repo rate 
expectations  remain  higher  than  the  repo  rate  path,  can  have  a  larger  than  normal 
downwards effect on repo rate expectations, thus increasing the effects on the economy. In 
the  absence  of  more  detailed  information  on  the  effect  that  may  be  dominant,  it  does  not 
seem unreasonable to assume that the effects of a reduction of the repo rate path will be of a 
normal scale.  
These figures and the estimated effects of a repo rate reduction are not the final word. Of 
course  the  future  will  bring  further  developments  of  Ramses  and  other  models,  more 
empirical  estimates  and  new  experience,  which  will  lead  to  the  revision  of  these  figures. 
However, I would claim that these figures are the latest and best word on the basis of the 
information  and  knowledge  currently  available,  and  therefore  provide  the  best  basis  for  a 
decision right now. 
Similarly, the mean squared gaps are perhaps not the last word when it comes to measuring 
the Riksbank’s target achievement. However, it is fair to claim that is the best way we have 
found so far of me assuring target achievement, that is, the extent to which the Riksbank has 
succeeded stabilising both inflation around the inflation target and resource utilisation around 
a normal level. 
I consider Figure 1 very clarifying. To summarise: It clearly shows that the lower repo rate 
path provides both a higher forecast for inflation measured in terms of the CPIF that is closer 
to the inflation target (which is shown in panel d) and a higher forecast for resource utilisation 
measured in terms of the output gap (panel e) or the gap for hours worked (panel f), which 
even with the lower repo rate is low but not as low as in the main scenario. Thus, a repo rate 
path  which  is  lower  than  that  in  the  main  scenario  stabilises  both  inflation  and  resource 
utilisation better. Panels b and c also show that the mean squared gaps for inflation, output 
and hours worked are lower under the lower repo rate path. 
Is there any reason not to choose the lower repo rate path? 
One might think that if one nevertheless does not choose the lower repo rate path one must 
have  strong  reasons  for  this.  So  what  does  the  Monetary  Policy  Report,  which,  of  course, 
represents the view of the majority of the Executive Board, say about the various monetary 
policy alternatives? After Figures 2.13–2.15 are presented, there is a sentence on page 38 
that states “Whether or not the repo rate levels set in these scenarios would lead to a better 
or  worse  development  of  the  economy  than  that  portrayed  in  the  main  scenario  is  not  a 
simple question to answer” (my italics). Speaking for myself, I actually find it, on the contrary, 
a very simple question to answer. The lower repo rate path provides a better development, 
while the higher provides a worse. 
The next paragraph mentions different measures of resource utilisation and emphasises the 
uncertainty  of  these  measures.  In  this  case,  however,  all  measures  of  resource  utilisation 
give  the  same  answer.  The  lower  repo  rate  path  is  better,  and  the  higher  is  worse.  Other 
forecasters  than  the  Riksbank,  such  as  the  National  Institute  of  Economic  Research,  the 
Ministry of Finance and the OECD, have even lower estimates of resource utilisation than the 
BIS Review 22/2010 
 7
Riksbank, as can be seen in Figure 2. The paragraph on resource utilisation thus provides no 
argument against choosing the lower repo rate path.  
The following paragraph states that it is difficult to know how economic agents will act and 
how financial markets will function when interest rates are very low. However, I do not know 
of  any  information  pointing  to  economic  agents  acting  differently  or  paradoxically  when 
interest rates are low, or why this should have such drastic consequences that it is allowed to 
dominate over other considerations. Interest rates have been very low in many countries for 
more  than  a  year;  moreover  there  have  been  much  lower  interest  rates  in  several  other 
countries  than  in  Sweden.  In  Switzerland  they  have  had  policy  rates  of  a  couple  of  basis 
points. As pointed out in the Economic Commentary “The lower limit of the Riksbank’s repo 
rate”  (Beechey  and  Elmér,  2009),  which  was  published  on  the  Riksbank’s  website  last 
autumn, one cannot find any problems in the financial markets that can be attributed to low 
interest rates.  
Since then a few more months have passed. Both the Monetary Policy Department and the 
Financial Stability Department at the Riksbank closely follow developments in the financial 
markets and have very good information about them. There are still no signs that low interest 
rates  have entailed  any  problems with  regard to  financial stability  or  the  functioning  of  the 
financial markets. The profitability of the major banks, in the form of the net interest margin, 
has been stable and their share of deposits from households has not changed noticeably. 
The  redistribution  of  capital  on  the  fund  market  has  also  been  moderate.  The  financial 
infrastructure has not been affected by any problems during the period of low interest rates 
and resilience against disruptions of the financial infrastructure is deemed to be high. 
The  final  paragraph  on  page  28  mentions  risks  linked  to  exaggerated  lending  and  rapid 
increases  in  house  prices.  These  risks  have  been  closely  studied  in  both  the  Riksbank’s 
most  recent  Financial  Stability  Report  and  by  Finansinspektionen  (the  Swedish  financial 
supervisory  authority)  in  its  report  on  the  Swedish  mortgage  market  and  bank  lending 
(Finansinspektionen, 2010). The unequivocal and certain conclusion based on very detailed 
data, studies and stress tests is that the housing market and credit granting do not at present 
entail any problem for financial stability. If such problems were to arise at some point in the 
future,  Finansinspektionen  has  suitable  instruments,  in  the  form  of  regulations  regarding 
leverage, amortisation and housing cost calculations. However, the repo rate is a very blunt 
and thus less suitable instrument for affecting potential risks of this sort. Consequently, there 
does not seem to be any reason to allow house prices and credit granting to affect the repo 
rate decision now. 
At the monetary policy meeting, a number of members of the Executive Board stated that a 
possible future fall in house prices may have a negative impact on consumption in the future. 
This  would  lead  to  a  fall  in  aggregate  demand,  with  negative  consequences  for  future 
resource utilisation and inflation. However, if one believes this, it should also be considered 
in the assessment of the influence of alternative repo rate paths on the forecasts for inflation 
and  resource  utilisation,  and  it  should  only  be  allowed  to  affect  monetary  policy  in  such  a 
case. These forecasts are mean forecasts, and some probability of a negative outcome has 
a negative impact on the mean. In this sense, the forecasts are “risk-adjusted”. As usual, it is 
necessary to filter all information through the forecasts to determine whether or not it should 
affect  monetary  policy.  As  usual,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  all  information,  where,  in 
practice,  the  assessment  of  effects  not  covered  by  models  is  of  great  significance.  If 
something cannot be considered to affect the expected value of future inflation and resource 
utilisation, then monetary policy does not need to react to it.7 
Kohn  (2006,  2008)  mentions  three  conditions  that  should  be  fulfilled  before  central  banks 
implement  “extraordinary  measures”  to  handle  possible  asset  price  bubbles,  such  as  the 
                                                 
7   See Svensson (2003) for a discussion of monetary policy with extreme outcomes with low probability.

 BIS Review 22/2010
unsustainable development of housing prices: “First, policymakers must be able to identify 
bubbles  in  a  timely  fashion  with  reasonable  confidence.  Second,  a  somewhat  tighter 
monetary policy must have a high probability that it will help to check at least some of the 
speculative  activity.  And  third,  the  expected  improvement  in  future  economic  performance 
that  would  result  from  the  curtailment  of  the  bubble  must  be  sufficiently  great.”  As  these 
conditions  are  very  seldom  fulfilled  in  practice,  it  is  very  seldom  that  the  issue  arises,  in 
practice, of allowing asset prices to influence monetary policy.8 
It has occasionally been claimed that a central bank should be cautious as regards lowering 
the interest rate to very low levels, as this would be venturing into unfamiliar waters. I object 
strongly to “unfamiliar waters” being an argument against cutting the repo rate. It is exactly 
by daring to move out into unfamiliar waters, with historically low interest rates right down to 
a few basis points, and with large unconventional measures, that the world’s central banks, 
including  the  Riksbank,  have  succeeded  in  preventing  the  major  crisis  from  becoming  the 
Great Depression mark two. 
It has also been claimed that the discussion on the lowest level of the repo rate was resolved 
at the monetary policy meeting in July 2009 and that there is no reason for a reassessment. 
In July, the majority of the Executive Board stated in a press release and in the Monetary 
Policy Report that “the Riksbank’s assessment is that, after cutting the repo rate to 0.25 per 
cent, it will have reached its lowest level in practice”. Firstly, as I expressed at the meeting in 
July, in my opinion, this statement was a mistake. It goes against the commonly accepted 
principle that the repo rate path is “a forecast, not a promise”. In practice, the statement is a 
promise not to lower the repo rate further. Furthermore, the statement implies that the repo 
rate path cannot normally be a mean forecast, as all risk is upside risk and the mean is then 
higher  than  the  repo  rate  path.  In  this  case,  the  actual  monetary  policy  will  be  more 
contractionary,  exactly  in  a  situation  in  which  a  more  expansionary  monetary  policy  is 
desired.9 Secondly, in my opinion, it is a mistake to continue to accept this lower limit and not 
thoroughly reassess it at every monetary policy meeting, in particular as later information and 
analysis indicates that very low interest rates do not give rise to any problems with financial 
stability or the financial infrastructure. 
It  has  also  been  claimed  that  it  would  be  wrong  to  lower  the  repo  rate  path  during  an 
economic upturn, even  if a very deep recession is still prevailing. I do not understand this 
argument. Whether it is right or wrong to lower the repo rate path should, in my opinion, be 
determined solely by whether the stabilisation of inflation and resource utilisation would be 
improved  or  impaired  by  a  lower  repo  rate.  I  cannot  discern  any  reason  for  it  to  be  less 
important to stabilise inflation and resource utilisation as efficiently as possible now that the 
economy has touched bottom and the prevailing deep recession has become somewhat less 
deep. 
Transparency and mean squared gaps 
Let me finally address the role of the mean squared gaps in improving the transparency of 
monetary policy. Monetary policy has a major impact on both inflation and the real economy. 
The  Executive  Board  bears  a  considerable  responsibility  for  its  decisions  and  their 
consequences  for  inflation  and  the  real  economy.  It  is  important  that  the  Riksdag,  the 
Committee on Finance and external analysts can examine and evaluate monetary policy and 
assess  whether  the  Executive  Board  has  made  the  right  decision  and  whether  monetary 
policy  is  well  balanced.  As  the  Committee  on  Finance  says  in  the  comments  mentioned 
above:  “A  flexible  monetary  policy  requires,  in  the  Committee’s  view,  a  high  degree  of 
                                                 
8  
Issues of the  significance of asset prices for monetary policy and  of the monetary policy conclusions to be 
drawn from the financial crisis are discussed further in Svensson (2009b, 2010b). See also Kohn (2009). 
9   These issues are discussed further in Svensson (2010a).

transparency and that the Riksbank is very clear about why the various repo rate decisions 
have  been  made.  This  is  also  a  prerequisite  for  the  possibility  to  examine  and  evaluate 
monetary policy.” 
In  order  for  the  Riksbank  to  be  able  to  be  “very  clear”  about  why  the  various  repo  rate 
decisions  have  been  made,  I  believe  it  to  be  necessary  to  discuss  and  assess  various 
possible  monetary  policy  alternatives  and  their  consequences  for  inflation  and  the  real 
economy. A specific decision can best be justified by comparing it to the alternatives. It is 
thus a question of clarifying the reasonable and possible repo rate paths that exist and what 
consequences  these  alternatives  paths  have  on  the  forecast  for  inflation  and  resource 
utilisation.  
Being able to measure and quantify target achievement is a major advantage. But how can 
the  degree  to  which  monetary  policy  has  succeeded  in  stabilising  inflation  and  resource 
utilisation  be  measured?  The  mean  squared  gap  for  inflation  is  a  natural  measure  of  the 
stability of inflation around the inflation target. The mean squared gap for output is a natural 
measure  of  the  stability  of  the  output  gap  and  thus  of  the  stability  of  resource  utilisation 
around a normal level.  
Looking at Figure 1, it could be claimed that the mean squared gaps in panels b and c do not 
tell us anything of significance, as it is obvious from panels d, e and f that the lower repo rate 
path leads to a better outcome. However, the situation is unusual in that the main scenario is 
not efficient – that is, that it is possible to find another repo rate path that better stabilises 
both  inflation  and  resource  utilisation.  A  more  normal  situation  is  one  in  which  a  balance 
must be struck between prioritising the stabilisation of either inflation or resource utilisation. 
Such a situation prevailed for Norges Bank in March 2005, for example. In Figure 4, I present 
the  mean  squared  gaps  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  alternative  policy  rate  paths  and 
equivalent  forecasts  for  inflation  and  resource  utilisation  presented  in  Norges  Bank’s 
monetary policy report from March 2005. The policy rate path then chosen depends upon the 
weighting  placed  by  the  central  bank  upon  stabilising  the  output  gap,  as  opposed  to 
stabilising inflation (this weight is usually denoted by   ). For example, in an assessment of 
monetary policy, this becomes an issue of whether the central bank attaches a reasonable 
relative  weight  to  the  stabilisation  of  resource  utilisation  and  whether  the  central  bank  is 
reasonably consistent over time.10 
The numerical inflation target has signified great progress for practical monetary policy and 
made  it  possible  to  measure  and  evaluate  the  target  achievement  of  monetary  policy  in  a 
much more effective manner than before. However, the fact that monetary policy is not just 
directed towards stabilising inflation, but also towards stabilising resource utilisation has, in 
the  absence  of  quantitative  measures  of  stability  in  these  variables,  made  it  difficult  to 
measure  and  evaluate  target  achievement  in  this  stability  dimension.  However,  the 
quantitative measure implied by the mean squared gaps makes it possible to measure and 
evaluate this target achievement. Using the mean squared gap may entail a progress similar 
to  the  earlier  introduction  of  the  numerical  inflation  target.  Following  the  introduction  of 
published policy rate paths, this is another step towards a better and more effective monetary 
policy and better opportunities to evaluate monetary policy’s target achievement. 
                                                 
10   According  to  Bergo  (2007)  and  Holmsen,  Qvigstad  and  Røisland  (2007),  an  optimal  policy  of     =  0.3  is 
compatible with the monetary policy forecasts published by Norges Bank (with a discount factor of 0.99 and a 
weighting in interest rate smoothing of 0.2). The steeper straight line in Figure 3 corresponds to    = 0.3, while 
the  flatter  line  corresponds  to     =  1.  Without  reference  to  interest  rate  smoothing,  the  main  scenario  is 
marginally preferable for    = 0.3.

 However,  the  use  of  quantitative  measures  of  monetary  policy  does  not  signify  that  these 
measures will always be the only guiding stars. The Riksbank and other central banks with 
inflation targets previously used a rule of action according to which the policy rate would be 
increased  or  decreased  depending  upon  whether  the  inflation  forecast,  calculated  for  a 
constant future interest rate, would be above or below the inflation target two years ahead. At 
the  same  time,  the  Riksbank  emphasised  that  deviation  from  this  rule  of  action  could  be 
justifiable in certain situations. However, in such a case, the reason for such deviation should 
be carefully explained. This rule of action played a significant role in the development of a 
more  efficient  and  transparent  monetary  policy  at  a  point  in  time  when  the  inflation  target 
policy  was  still  relatively  young  and  untested,  but  it  is  now  obsolete  and  has  been 
abandoned. However, it is important to retain the principle that deviations from quantitative 
targets  may  arise  but  that  such  cases  should  be  carefully  explained.  Deviations  from  the 
inflation target may arise but such cases should carefully be explained. In the same manner, 
it  is  possible  to  imagine  situations  in  which  it  may  be  justifiable  to  deviate  from  the  best 
possible degree of stability in inflation and resource utilisation, but the justification for such 
deviations  should  then  be  carefully  explained,  so  that  external  analysts  can  determine 
whether these deviations are reasonable.  
From this perspective, the use of the mean squared gaps forms just one more step towards a 
more systematic and transparent inflation targeting, in which central banks can be evaluated 
and  held  responsible  for  their  decisions  with  even  greater  accuracy  than  before,  after  the 
introduction  of  numerical  inflation  targets,  published  forecasts  for  inflation  and  the  real 
economy,  published  policy-rate  paths,  detailed  and  attributed  minutes  and  other  important 
steps taken in the development of a systematic and transparent monetary policy.
