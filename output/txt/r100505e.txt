Budi Mulya: Investment opportunity in Indonesia – looking toward a 
better future 
Keynote  speech  by  Mr  Budi  Mulya,  Deputy  Governor  of  Bank  Indonesia,  at  the  New  York 
Society of Security Analysts (NYSSA) seminar, New York, 15 April 2010. 
 Let us start by expressing our gratefulness to the God almighty. I’m very proud and honor to 
be here today and have all the opportunity to share with you. For that reason, let me deliver 
my sincere gratitude to my fellows NYSSA, speakers, my colleagues in Indonesian Embassy 
and  Bank  Indonesia  Representative  Office,  as  well  as  to  you  all  of  being  here  today  and 
make this happen.

Distinguished guest, ladies and gentlemen  
Indonesia is a rich country and proven to earn a strategic position and potentials across the 
region  and  the  world.  Shares  borders  with  Malaysia, Papua  New  Guinea,  East  Timor, 
Singapore,  Malaysia,  Philippines, and  Australia,  Indonesia  is  a  big  archipelago  with 
17,508 islands  scattered  over  the  length  of  741,050 sq mi  or  almost  at  the  same  distance 
between  California  to  Maine.  Indonesia’s  size, tropical  climate  and  archipelagic  geography 
offer  rich  and  extensive  natural  resources  and  support  the  world’s  second  highest  level  of 
biodiversity 
fourth most 
populous country  as  well  as  a  huge  consumption  base  as  the  population  reaches  around 
231 million people by 2009 and is expected to grow to almost 300 million by 2050. Almost 
45 percent from almost 114 million workforces are in agriculture sector, with the remaining 
employed in the expanding manufacturing industry, mining, and services. 
Indonesia is also the largest economy in Southeast Asia and a member of the G-20. In 2009, 
Indonesia’s  nominal  GDP  reach  almost  US$515  billion  with  nominal per  capita  GDP was 
US$2,590,  and  per  capita  GDP  PPP  was  US$4,150.  All  together,  the tertiary  sector is  the 
economy  largest  and  accounts  for  about  45%  of  GDP  proving  the  strong  character  of  a 
domestic  driven  economy.  Major  industries  include  petroleum  and  natural  gas,  textiles, 
apparel,  and  mining  while  major  agricultural  products  include palm  oil,  rice,  tea,  coffee, 
spices, and rubber. Indonesia is also an open economy with a sizable trade surplus in 2009, 
consisting  of  export revenues  of  almost  US$120  billion  and import expenditure  of  about 
US$84 billion with Japan, United States, Singapore, and China as our main trading partners.  
Nonetheless  the  story  is  not  always  wonderful.  After  enjoying  a  period  of  high  economic 
growth,  the  1997–98  financial  crises  brought  out  structural  consequences  in  the  domestic 
financial system and governance, damping investment, and private sector development. As a 
result,  the  average  annual  growth  4–5%  since  the  1997–98  crises  is  not  sufficient  to 
significantly  increase  per  capita  income,  accommodate  the  increasing  number  of  new 
entrants in the labor market, and reduce poverty. Similarly, the current investment share of 
about  25%  of  GDP  is  still  too  far  to  achieve  the  pre-crisis  growth  average  of  7–8%  when 
investment shares were more than 30%.  
On that account, creating new jobs by encouraging investment is very essential for us. This 
is  a  daunting  challenge,  given  the  many  structural  impediments  concerning  the  macro 
fundamentals,  governance  and  institutions,  and  infrastructure  in  the  economy.  All  of  these 
lessons emphasize us the urgent need for an improvement in the overall investment climate. 
Measures have been taken and significant progress has been achieved in the last five years. 
The  recent  World  Investment  Prospect  2009–2011,  UNCTAD,  for  instance,  reported 
Indonesia ranks number 9 of 15 countries as the most prospective investment destination by 
foreign  investors.  A  number  of  key  factors  of  Indonesia’s  attractiveness  for  investments

include  growth  prospects  and  market  size,  access  to  natural  resources,  and  relatively 
competitive labor costs. 
Distinguished guest, ladies and gentlemen  
Today, Indonesia has emerged a very different country compared with a decade ago. It has 
embarked  upon  a  far-reaching  institutional  transformation  and  has  become  one  of  the 
region’s most vibrant democracies. The first stage of this transformation, from 1998 to 2003, 
was  a  period  of  political  and  economic  change,  characterized  by  democratization  and 
decentralization  of  government. 
Indonesia’s  almost  500  provincial,  district  and  city 
governments  now  undertake  nearly  40  percent  of  public  spending.  Despite  obstacles  it 
brought,  decentralization  contributed  to  the  consoling  of  regional  conflicts  and  promotes 
political stability as well as offers an emerging more vibrant spatial geographic distribution of 
economic development throughout the country. The second stage, from 2004 was a period of 
democratic  institutions  consolidation  as  well  as  returning  to  political  and  macroeconomic 
stability, most notable in Indonesia’s first direct presidential elections and in its debt levels 
falling to below 35% of GDP1.  
Among  others,  the  Government  has  taken  steps  to  address  different  aspects  of  the 
investment climate through policy reform packages covering key areas of concern of private 
investors, such as taxes, customs, investment frameworks, and the financial sector. On the 
institutional transformation, the Government is working to set up the institutional framework, 
coordinating  mechanisms  and  enhancing  governance.  On  the  provincial  side, a  number  of 
sub-national  governments  have  undertaken  major  reforms  of  their  public  sector  systems, 
introducing among others performance-based budgeting and one-stop public services. The 
legal  arrangement  is  also  directed  to  improve  investment  climate,  both  directly  by 
promulgating Investment Law No. 25 of 2007 and indirectly by imposing open capital account 
through  promulgating  Law  No.  24  of  1999.  The  later  is  set  up  to  improve  the  financial 
infrastructure to support capital inflows, both for direct investment and portfolios.  
To enhance macroeconomic stability, government and so does the monetary authority works 
hand  in  hand  and  commits  to  enhance  fiscal  and  monetary  discipline  as  well  as 
strengthening the financial architectures. Learning from the failure of 1997–1998 crises, our 
policies were focused on enhancing policy transmission, improving financial market efficiency 
through  prudential  practices  and  financial  market  deepening.  To  this  point  forward,  the 
Government  was  improving  their  capacity  on  fiscal  budgeting,  to  be  more  specific,  the 
adoption  of  active  debt  and  cash  management.  They  are  also  fully  committed  to  improve 
fiscal  sustainability  by  reducing  debt  to  GDP  ratio.  Steps  were  also  taken  in  the  area  of 
monetary  policy  framework.  Since  1999,  Bank  Indonesia  was  mandated  to  achieve  single 
objective of price stability, both in terms of inflation and the exchange rate and at the same 
time  was  given  independency  on  our  policy  conduct.  In  2005,  Bank  Indonesia  has  fully 
adopted Inflation Targeting Framework marked by the introduction of BI Rate as the policy 
rate  to  increase  the  policy  effectiveness  in  achieving  the  inflation  target  set  by  the 
Government.  In  2008,  further  enhancement  has  been  done  in  the  area  of  monetary  policy 
implementation  by  the  introduction  of  overnight  interbank  rate  as  our  operational  target  to 
improve the effectiveness of the monetary policy.  
Institutional reform  in  the  financial  sector  has  been  done  by  improving  the  soundness  and 
efficiency  of  the  financial  market  through  the  combination  of  imposing  prudential  practices 
and enhancing market deepening. Financial sector reforms are crucial to raising Indonesia’s 
growth  rate  and  enhancing  the  economy’s  resilience.  In  banking  industry,  reform  is 
conducted  by  strengthening  bank’s  capital,  introducing  risk  management  practices  and

governance,  and  not  to  mention  improving  supervisory  capabilities.  These  were  done  by 
adopting Basel core principles and promoting mergers and acquisitions. The same reforms 
have conducted in the capital market, debt market, as well as non-bank financial institution. 
One of the most important breakthroughs can be observed in the development of the debt 
market  following  the  issuance  of  marketable  government  bond  in  2002,  which  is  not  only 
useful  to  deepen  the  financial  market  but  also  significantly  reduced  the  need  for  foreign 
financing and thus increase the economic resiliency.  
Distinguished guest, ladies and gentlemen  
Strong  commitment  to  reforms  has  yielded  a  progressive  and  more  resilient  fundamental 
performance, especially in the last five years. Indonesia resumed higher levels of growth and 
has  re-emerged  as  a  confident  middle-income  country  as  well  as  increasing  regional  and 
global  standing  as  the  world’s  strongest  economic  performers  close  to  those  of  India  and 
China. Indonesia’s economic growth accelerated to a 10-year high and proven to be robust 
during the wake of the 2008–2009 global economic crisis. Real GDP has been growing at 
5 to  6  percent  annually  since  2002  and,  in  2009  per-capita  real  GDP  exceeded  the  level 
reached in 1997, immediately prior to the Asian crisis. The legacy of Government’s prudent 
fiscal management and a strategy of fiscal consolidation have contributed to the significant 
reduction  in  government  debt  levels,  which  are  estimated  to  fall  to  31.5%  by  end-2009. 
Investment  share  to  GDP  is  improving  though  is  still  below  pre-crisis  levels.  In  2009, 
Indonesia’s  was  23%  of  GDP,  or  significantly  improves  from  19  percent  of  GDP  in  2002 
signaling  a  structural  improvement  on  the  business  climate.  Increasing  efficiency  on  the 
institutional framework as well as strong fiscal and monetary discipline has also been able to 
reduce inflation markedly and so does the exchange rate. In the financial sector, the banking 
sector, which account for about 80% of the financial industry’s assets, is in sound shape and 
is relatively unexposed to developments in troubled financial markets elsewhere. Indonesia 
has a well-developed and well-regulated banking sector and has made major advances over 
the  past  five  years  in  establishing  a  sound  legal  and  administrative  framework  for  the 
modernization of public financial management in line with good international practice. 
On  the  last  April  2nd,  2010,  OECD  upgrades  Country  Risk  Classification  (CRC)  ranks  of 
Indonesia  from  the  previous  level  of  5  to  4.  Indonesia  was  the  only  country  of  the 
161 countries,  given  the  CRC  upgrade  in  the  latest  OECD  committee  meeting  session  on 
April  2010.  The  main 
impressive 
macroeconomic  indicators  as  the  economy  is  one  of  the  most  resilient  amid  the  global 
financial crises and Indonesia is one of the few countries that experienced positive economic 
growth in 2009. Improvement in macroeconomic performance and economic stability is the 
result  of  a  combination  of  good  and  forward  looking  economic  policy,  ongoing  structural 
reforms,  as  well  as  good  debt  management.  Prior  to  this  upgrade,  on  March  12,  2010, 
Standard and Poor’s also upgraded Indonesia long-term foreign currency rating to BB (from 
BB–) and long-term local currency rating stays at BB+. Outlook for both are “positive”. The 
upgrade was also observe in the rank of global competitiveness as publicized by the World 
Economic  Forum.  On  the  2009–2010  Global  Competitiveness  Index,  Indonesia  rank  was 
increasing to 54 from previously 72 in 2003. The upgrade would certainly put Indonesia in a 
better position before its creditors in negotiating, particularly export credit creditors.  
During  the  2008–2009  worldwide  contraction,  Indonesian  economy  still  enjoyed  a  positive 
growth of 6.0% in 2008 and 4.5% in 2009 and held by high and inclusive growth of domestic 
demand, particularly consumption. Indonesia is less exposed to external shocks than other 
economies in the region as its trade share to GDP is relatively small at about 50 percent of 
GDP.  Inflation  is  moderated  and  achieved  year-on-year  increases  of  only  3.4%  in  March 
2010 held by adequate supply responses and rupiah exchange rate appreciation. As a result, 
the  unemployment  rate  fell  back  from  11%  in  2005  to  7.9%  in  2009.  This  development 
supports the fall of the poverty rate that has fallen by about one percentage point per year 
since 2003 and reached 15 percent in 2009. On the external balance, balance of payments is

strong and achieved a current account surplus of US$10.5 billion and capital account surplus 
of  US$2.3  billion  in  2009.  This  has  contributed  to  a  sizeable  accumulation  of  official 
international reserves, which to date approached US$71.8 billion in March 2010, providing 
Indonesia with a cushion against external shocks. Strong fundamentals have been proven as 
the  key  cushion  to  the  adverse  impact  of  global  economic  downturn  and  quickly  revive 
market  risk  appetite  toward  Indonesian  asset  classes.  The  exchange  rate  has  been 
appreciated about 24% at Rp9090 per US$ by the end of March 2010 from its weakest level 
of Rp12,020 per US$ in February 2009 on the back of net foreign capital inflows. Constraint 
on  liquidity  following  the  recent  global  credit  squeezing  has  been  recovered  as  the 
counterparty risk revived quickly and the market spreads narrowed.  
Indonesia’s economic outlook is favorable. Growth is projected to reach the upper level of 
5.5–6.0 percent range in 2010, rise to 6.0–6.5 percent in 2011 and is expected to gradually 
returning to trend growth rates approaching 7.0 percent thereafter, on the back of the upturns 
in  export  growth  following  ongoing  global  economic  recovery  as  well  as  investment 
acceleration.  Investment  is  expected  to  grow  9  percent  in  2010  and  rise  even  faster  by 
11 percent in 2011 on the back of higher public capital spending on infrastructure that driven 
better  private  investment  and  lower  risk  premium.  On  the  fiscal  side,  Indonesia  has  been 
able,  through  prudent  fiscal  policy,  to  bring  its  public  debt  to  GDP  ratio  lower.  Projections 
indicate that this trend is likely to continue. Inflation will continue to moderate and is likely to 
be at the lower end of its target range of 5%±1% in 2010 and 2011 as the output gap is still 
wide enough to response to the acceleration in demand side and supported by stable rupiah 
exchange rate. In the medium term, inflation is expected to converge to its regional average 
at  3.5–4.0%.  On  the  external  side,  current  account  and  capital  account  is  expected  to 
continue in surplus of US$5 billion and US$ 8 billion consecutively, support the continuingly 
surplus  balance  of  payments  and  drive 
international  reserve.  Favorable 
development  on  the  fundamental  sides  along  with  ample  market  liquidity  will  maintain 
stability on the financial market especially in banking industry i.e credit will grow of 17–20% 
in 2010, along with high CAR around 19% and subdued NPLs below 5%. Well maintained 
macroeconomic  fundamentals,  strengthening  external  liquidity  position,  gradually  declining 
government  debt  ratio,  supported  by  prudent  fiscal  policy  and  smooth  implementation  of 
structural  reforms,  is  expected  to  sustain  higher  economic  growth  in  the  coming  years  to 
keep the positive momentum for further rating improvement.

Distinguished guest, ladies and gentlemen  
Despite  these  achievements,  new  challenges  are  waiting  in  front  of  us  and  hence  much 
progress  is  still  needed.  The  main  constraint  for  Indonesia’s  economic  development  is  to 
translate  the  available  resources  into  better  outcomes.  Delivering  better  development 
outcomes  now  depends 
through 
strengthening accountability and capacity at all levels, as well as ensuring that much of future 
growth is driven by private sector development2.  
There  are  much  to  be  done  in  the  area  of  resource  allocation,  incentives  system,  and 
transparency.  Investment  rates  are  improving,  but  are  still  below  pre-crisis  levels.  The 
Government has taken steps to address different aspects of the investment climate through 
policy  reform  packages  but  several  challenges  remain.  Institutional  capture  is  a  major 
obstacle in this area, with many reforms still to be implemented effectively and evenly on the 
ground.  Improving  the  quality  of  Indonesia’s  infrastructure  is  another  essential  aspect  of 
strengthening Indonesia’s competitiveness and we are still work on it with full commitment. 
As far as recent development and prospect of the economy, challenge emerge as the global

recovery  process  makes  is  still  highly  uncertain  and  will  determine  the  degree  to  which 
Indonesia’s growth accelerates in 2010 and beyond. 
I believe that the future success will depend on improving the policy conduct and quality of 
our institutions, particularly the public sector. Our top priority is to maintain stability as well as 
increase the resiliency of domestic financial market from possible liquidity shock. Our policy 
will  always  be  directed  consistently  on  achieving  medium  term  inflation  target  and  thus 
promote macroeconomic stability. 
For  sustainable  growth,  Indonesia  will  have  to  ensure  effective  implementation  of  key 
reforms to the investment climate to both permits the private sector to drive growth and to 
increase  public  institutions  capacity.  On  my  view,  access  to  financial  services  should  be 
enhanced  through  a  well-functioning  and  deep  financial  market.  The  later  is  needed  to 
facilitate  and  promote  longer  term  investment,  maintain  markets  confidence  especially  on 
short-term  investment,  and  thus  prevent  the  economy  from  sudden  reversal.  This  can  be 
done  by  improving  market  efficiency  through  prudent  practices  of  the  market  players, 
existence  of  liquid  market,  strong  liquidity  risk  management,  and  wider-range  financial 
instruments  including  hedging  instruments.  The  presence  of  credible  credit  information 
system  is  also  needed  to  lessen  credit  risks  and  lowers  borrowing  costs.  Against  this 
backdrop,  we  are  committed  to  improve  regulatory  quality,  the  rule  of  law,  and  good 
governance through accountability and enhancing institutional capacity. 
Distinguished guest, ladies and gentlemen  
Building  on  its  existing  economic  and  political  fundamentals,  Indonesia  today  has  the 
opportunity  to  create  this  virtuous  cycle  of  sustainable  and  inclusive  growth.  Overall, 
Indonesia has a strong willingness to improve the condition. I am very optimistic to 
the direction of Indonesian economy ahead and expect you all would share the same few. 
Before I end up my remarks, I would like to deliver my sincere gratitude to all distinguished 
speaker Mr. John Chambers, Dr. Richard Clarida, and Mr. Russell King, who has dedicated 
their  valuable  time  to  share  with  us  today,  and  for  that  reason,  let’s  us  proceed  to  the 
Seminar and have a fruitful discussion. 
God bless you all.
