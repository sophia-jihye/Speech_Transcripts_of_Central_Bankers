José De Gregorio: Chile’s latest Monetary Policy Report 
Presentation  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  of  the 
Monetary  Policy  Report  before  the  Finance  Commission  of  the  Honorable  Senate  of  the 
Republic, Santiago de Chile, 6 April 2010. 
 Introduction 
Ms President of the Finance Commission Senator Evelyn Matthei, senators. 
I  am  grateful  for  this  Commission’s  invitation  to  the  Board  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile  to 
present our vision of the recent macroeconomic developments, prospects and implications 
for monetary policy contained in detail in our Monetary Policy Report of March 2010. 
In  the  past  few  years,  the  Chilean  economy  and  macroeconomic  policies  have  been 
subjected  to  unprecedented  tension.  First  we  suffered  the  consequences  of  a  major 
inflationary shock caused by great increases in the price of foodstuffs and energy, with large 
and costly repercussions on the economy. In a country that had left the scourge of inflation 
behind, the population had to endure the rigors of price increases once again. The structural 
characteristics of our economy – small, open, and market oriented – with few distortions in its 
pricing  mechanisms,  contributed  decisively  to  the  international  price  shock  being  heavily 
transmitted to domestic prices. These same characteristics also contributed to the significant 
reductions in inflation that were observed beginning in late 2008. 
At  a  time  when  our  monetary  policy  was  working  hard  to  prevent  the  propagation  of  the 
inflationary shock to other prices, we suffered the onset of an international financial crash of 
a magnitude not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The sharp fall in demand, 
caused  largely  by  a  crisis  of  confidence  and  an  unprecedented  rise  in  volatility  and 
uncertainty, caused a severe downturn in the world economy and in Chile. The downturn was 
especially strong in the last quarter of 2008 and the first four months of 2009. The drop in 
output during that period was determinant in the recession we saw last year. 
Macroeconomic  policies  reacted  strongly.  However,  they  could  do  little  to  counteract  the 
immediate effects of this phenomenon, not only because of the lags with which they operate, 
but especially because of the sudden nature of the collapse in demand. Still, and as we have 
previously  claimed,  a  monetary  policy  based  on  a  flexible  inflation  targeting  regime  –  that 
allows  for  the  accommodation  of  shocks  over  a  reasonable  period  of  time  –,  a  floating 
exchange rate, a solid financial system and a fiscal policy that saved during the good times, 
were key to ensuring a rapid and sustainable economic recovery. Our macroeconomic policy 
scheme  allowed  us  implementing  an  unprecedented  stimulus,  which  has  had  important 
positive effects on output, within a context of well contained inflationary pressures. 
The national economy began recovering by the middle of the second quarter of 2009. In the 
second half of last year, it was already growing at an annualized rate of 6 percent. Indeed, 
we were forecasting that 2010 growth would be around 5 percent as early as last September. 
The  figures  up  to  February  27  –  as  shown  in  a  box  in  the  Report  –,  indicated  that  the 
midpoint of the growth range could be closer to 6 percent than to 5 percent. Compared with 
our  trading  partners  or  with  the  average  growth  forecast  for  Latin  America,  this  figure  is 
around two percentage points greater. Expansionary monetary policy has played a key role 
in our economy’s strong performance. 
Nonetheless, our country was then hit by another shock. On February 27 we suffered one of 
the worst natural disasters in history that took a tragic toll on our country, causing loss of life, 
numerous  injuries,  forced  displacement  of  large  numbers  of  people,  and  huge  material 
damages. Although the prospects of our country’s progress have not been compromised, this 
BIS Review 61/2010 
 1
new  scenario  poses  important  challenges  in  every  aspect  of  national  life,  including  the 
conduct of monetary policy. 
The  immediate  reaction  of  an  economy  to  a  natural  disaster  is  highly  uncertain.  Historical 
evidence tells us little because such events are, luckily, very rare. Therefore, the evaluation 
of data released since the disaster must be done with extreme caution. In fact, output data 
for March and April will reveal very poor performance. 
The  reaction  of  the  economy  to  a  natural  catastrophe  in  the  medium  term  is  somewhat 
clearer. Conceptually, this can be understood as a supply shock, as it destroys part of the 
country’s  productive  capacity  and  cuts  down  the  level  of  potential  output.  All  other  things 
being  equal,  this  fact  causes  output  gaps  to  close  and  inflationary  pressures  to  increase. 
These pressures must be contained to prevent inflation from surpassing the 3 percent target 
over  a  two-year  horizon.  The  virtue  of  our  monetary  policy  regime  is  that  it  is  based  on 
achieving  the  objective  over  a  medium-term  horizon,  which  gives  room  for  adjusting  the 
monetary stimulus while maintaining sustainable economic growth during the reconstruction. 
Properly conducting this process is the challenge we face and that provides the framework 
for the analysis contained in this Monetary Policy Report. 
In  what  follows,  I  will  describe  the  latest  economic  and  financial  events,  our  preliminary 
assessment of the effects of the earthquake and tsunami on the prospects and risks facing 
our economy, and the way in which annual inflation will converge to the 3 percent target over 
the two-year horizon. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
As  I  have  said  before,  Chile’s  macroeconomic  scenario  has  suffered  major  changes  since 
December’s Monetary Policy Report. Among a large number of developments, two elements 
stand out. There is no doubt that the most significant is the earthquake and tsunami of last 
February  and  both  their  immediate  and  medium-term  implications  for  growth  and  inflation. 
Additionally,  before  this  sad  event, the  first  release  of the National  Accounts  for  2009  and 
data at hand for the period preceding the catastrophe showed domestic output and demand 
growing faster than previously expected.  
Let me discuss both in more detail. Incoming information since the statistical closure of our 
December Report suggested that the foreseen recovery of domestic output and demand was 
not only materializing but doing so faster than anticipated. GDP dropped 1.5 percent in 2009, 
less  than  the  1.9  percent  drop  that  had  been  forecast  in  December.  In  the  fourth  quarter, 
GDP actually rose 2.1 percent annually. These figures showed a faster recovery for those 
industries more closely linked to domestic demand, particularly manufacturing and retail. In 
the  second half  of  the  year  the  economy  grew  at  an  annualized  rate  of  around  6  percent, 
narrowing the output gap more than December’s forecast (figure 1). Domestic demand also 
fell less than forecast in December. Data for the last quarter of 2009 stood out because of 
the  performance  of  consumption  and  investment  in  machinery  and  equipment.  In  addition, 
inventories for the year as a whole had a milder depletion than previously expected.  
Information  available  prior  to  the  earthquake  and  tsunami  pointed  to  a  continuation  of  the 
strong evolution of output and domestic demand. Sales indicators showed an upward trend 
and  indices  of  consumers’  and  firms’  perceptions  were  at  optimistic  levels  (figure  2).  The 
labour market was also picking up, with increased employment and an evolving composition 
by occupation. 
Domestically,  financial  conditions  showed  early  signs  of  normalizations,  with  lending 
increasing  from  month  to  month,  low  interest  rates  and  credit  standards  that  were  more 
expansionary during the fourth quarter of 2009 than during the preceding quarter (figure 3). 
The  value  of  the  peso  has  fluctuated  significantly  since  December,  partly  owing  to  global 
phenomena,  but  largely  due  to  domestic  factors.  After  continuing  with  the  process  of 
2 
 BIS Review 61/2010
appreciation  that  began  in  early  October,  the  peso  peaked  at  the  beginning  of  January.  It 
then  depreciated  sharply,  driven  by  increased  tensions  in  world  financial  markets  and  by 
changes in the hedging strategies used by pension funds. The depreciation trend reversed 
during the course of February due to a decline in external tensions and a change in pension 
funds’  purchase  flows.  After  the  earthquake  and  tsunami,  the  peso  experienced  further 
fluctuations due to changes in private expectations about how the reconstruction would be 
financed and how insurance claims would be paid. The importance of idiosyncratic factors is 
apparent  in  multilateral  indicators  that  measure  the  peso’s  movements  with  respect  to  the 
dollar  and  other  currencies,  which  are  showing  smaller  variations  than  those  of  the 
peso/dollar exchange rate (figure 1). 
Annual  CPI  inflation  returned  to  positive  territory  earlier  than  what  had  been  foreseen  in 
December  (figure  2).  Core  measures,  in  particular  the  CPIX1,  continued  to  display  low 
month-on-month  variations.  The  change  in  methodology  used  to  measure  the  CPI,  which 
changed  from  a  basket  for  the  Metropolitan  Region  to  a  nationwide  survey,  had  its  main 
effects in January, when CPI inflation exceeded the rise anticipated by the market.  
Additionally,  the  international  scenario  relevant  for  Chile  became  more  benign.  Economic 
activity  has  continued  to  recover  globally,  with  Chile’s  trading  partners  consolidating  their 
forecasts  for  strong  economic  growth.  Growth  projections  for  2010  and  2011  have  been 
revised upward and commodity prices began to rise once again (figure 6). Perceived risk has 
continued decreasing in financial markets, fueling an increase in stock prices, although they 
remain  below  their  pre-crisis  peaks.  In  the  past  few  months,  the  main  source  of  stress  in 
these markets has been concern over the fiscal situation of European economies. Eurozone 
authorities and the IMF have agreed on financial support mechanisms and have announced 
major adjustments, particularly in Greece, thus helping reduce financial tensions. However, 
this issue is still cause for concern in the external scenario. 
Around  the  world,  central  banks  have  continued  withdrawing  gradually  the  unconventional 
monetary policy measures. Nonetheless, monetary authorities maintain the emphasis on the 
gradual  nature  of  their  interest  rate  normalization  processes,  within  a  context  where  core 
inflation  figures  remain  well  contained  in  the  industrialized  world  (figure  7).  Market 
expectations  about  future  increases  in  policy  rates  have  been  postponed.  Overall,  some 
countries continue with or have begun a process of increases in their policy rates. 
As  discussed  in  a  box  in  this  Report,  just  adding  up  the  above  elements  configured  a 
medium-term  scenario  where  inflationary  pressures  and  inflation  would  exceed  December 
expectations.  A  counterfactual  forecast  exercise  that  considers  developments  only  up  to 
February 26 yields that the foreseen growth range for this year would have been around one 
percentage  point  higher.  Output  gaps,  besides  starting  at  a  smaller  level  than  had  been 
projected,  would  also  close  sooner,  with  corresponding  effects  on  inflation.  In  the  medium 
term, all these changes would have shaped a scenario where inflation would have risen to 
3 percent or more over the course of this year, and would have approached the 3 percent 
target from above in a two year horizon.  
The response of monetary policy in this hypothetical scenario is unambiguous. The pace of 
monetary policy normalization would have been faster than the one foreseen in December’s 
Report. Indeed, it is likely that inflation convergence to the target would have been consistent 
with a higher level of the MPR beginning in midyear and throughout the policy horizon. 
It was in this context that the earthquake and tsunami hit. Their effects on the macroeconomy 
are relevant for the conduct of monetary policy. First, they caused a loss in capital stock that 
affected  the  economy’s  productive  capacity  and  therefore  the  evaluation  of  output  gaps, 
inflationary pressures and the monetary policy reaction. Second, they are having an impact 
on output, demand and inflation in the very short term, mostly due to the disruption of retail 
and  manufacturing  activity.  Finally,  there  will  be  an  additional  effect  associated  with  the 
public  and  private  reconstruction  efforts.  The  ultimate  impact  on  growth  and  inflation  will 
BIS Review 61/2010

depend, among other factors, on the magnitude, composition and timing of those efforts, on 
the sources of funding that are used and on the focus of the related expenditures.  
As for the size of the loss in productive capital stock, the Board’s working assumption for this 
Report’s baseline scenario is that the catastrophe destroyed 3 percent of the economy’s net 
capital stock. Such an estimate, which is detailed in a box inside the Report, is based on the 
damage  survey  published  by  the  government  on  March  23  and  on  the  historical  ratio 
between the gross value and the net value of the capital stock.  
To clarify this calculation, it is important to explain how this capital stock is measured. First, 
the gross capital stock equals the value of assets used in the productive process, valued “as 
new”.  In  other  words,  the  nominal  gross  value  of  the  capital  stock  can  be  proxied  by  the 
replacement cost. Second, the net value of the capital stock is the gross value of the capital 
stock minus the assets’ depreciation. This distinction between gross and net value of capital 
is  important,  because  the  latter  –  the  net  value  –  is  what  matters  when  measuring  the 
economy’s  productive  capacity  and,  therefore,  trend  GDP,  the  output  gap  and  inflationary 
pressures.  
According  to  the  survey  of  damages  from  the  earthquake  and  tsunami  delivered  by  the 
government  on  March  23,  the  cost  to  replace  the  destroyed  capital  stock  amounts  to 
20.94 billion  US  dollars.  Following  the  reasoning  described  above,  this  figure  is  the 
equivalent  to  the  gross  value  of  the  lost  capital  stock.  How  then  can  we  estimate  the  net 
value of the capital destroyed? Estimates in our national accounts indicate that between the 
years 2000 and 2008 the net value of the capital stock was around 63 percent of the gross 
stock. Applying this percentage directly, we estimate that the damage to the net capital stock, 
consistent  with  the  figure  disclosed  by  the  government,  is  13.2  billion  US  dollars.  If  we 
consider that the net capital stock amounted in 2009 to an estimated 435 billion US dollars, 
the aforementioned loss is equivalent to nearly 3 percent of the total. 
Therefore, given a loss of 3 percent in the net capital stock, the Board estimates that during 
this year the level of trend GDP will fall 1.0% to 1.5% because of the catastrophe.  
The  magnitude  of  the  short-term  impact  of  the  natural  disaster  depends  on  the  share  in 
national GDP of the hardest hit regions, the sectoral composition of production by region and 
the duration of downtime in productive processes, among other factors. In 2008, Regions VI, 
VII and VIII produced nearly 16% of national GDP, mostly concentrated in the manufacturing 
sector.  As  for  the  labour  market,  the  three  regions  generate  almost  one  fifth  of  national 
employment.  The  Board  estimates  that  the  disaster  had  a  negative  effect  of  about 
3 percentage points on first-quarter GDP growth. In the second quarter, assuming a gradual 
normalization of productive processes, the effect is reduced to around 2 percentage points. 
These assumptions are based on a scenario in which the reduction in output is concentrated 
in Regions VI, VII and VIII, and primarily affects the manufacturing sector. It is important to 
consider that the difficulties caused by the catastrophe in the making of spending decisions 
may  hold  down  demand,  and  it  is  likely  that  some  short-term  effects  will  be  seen  in 
consumption and inventories. With respect to inflation, problems in production or distribution 
will probably increase the price level immediately, an effect that should be temporary for the 
most part. 
The usual economic statistics for March could give a better approximation of the immediate 
effects of the earthquake and tsunami. Overall, the complexity of an accurate reading of the 
data  must  be  taken  into  account,  partly  due  to  difficulties  and  delays  in  the  collection  of 
information  used  in  the  construction  of  official  statistics.  Actually,  the  task  of  gathering 
February’s information – carried out in March – has already proven problematic. 
In the medium term, the dynamics of demand, economic activity and output gaps will depend 
not  only  on  usual  concerns  about  the  world  economy,  but  also  on  the  size  and  specific 
characteristics of reconstruction efforts. As a working assumption, the Board considers that 
the additional investment as a consequence of the catastrophe will be equivalent to nearly 
one percentage point of GDP in 2010. This effect will be concentrated in the second half of 
4 
 BIS Review 61/2010
this  year  and  will  increase  towards  2011.  This  considers  both  new  investment  and 
reallocated  resources  from  other  projects.  The  materialization  of  these  investments  will  be 
favoured by their high marginal productivity and because part of the loss in net capital stock 
was  insured.  In  the  case  of  the  public  sector,  according  to  announcements  from  the 
Executive,  the  baseline  scenario  considers  that  the  structural  deficit  of  2009  was  1.2%  of 
GDP  and  that  structural  fiscal  balance  will  be  attained  towards  the  end  of  the  current 
Administration’s term. Budgetary reallocations this year will amount to about US$700 million, 
while the rebuilding of destroyed public infrastructure will be spread out over four years. As a 
working assumption, the Board estimates that the burden of financing the public and private 
reconstruction efforts will be distributed equally among its various sources. 
Considering  the  economic  situation  leading  up  to  the  disaster  together  with  its  short  and 
medium  term  effects,  the  Board  estimates  that  during  this  year  GDP  will  grow  between 
4.25%  and  5.25%.  This  range  is  somewhat  lower  than  was  forecast  in  December.  The 
downward revision for this year is based on the fact that the immediate economic effects of 
the earthquake and tsunami will exceed the increases generated by the reconstruction efforts 
(table 1). 
In the baseline scenario of this Report, the sum of the effects of the catastrophe, the changes 
in  conjunctural  data  and  other  specific  elements  shapes  a  scenario  where  inflation  will 
converge  to  3%  sooner  than  was  forecast  in  December.  The  change  in  the  medium-term 
inflation scenario is determined by the effects of the earthquake and tsunami on productive 
capacity  and  by  the  persistence  and  magnitude  of  a  potential  contraction  in  private 
consumption.  In  the  baseline  scenario,  annual  CPI  variation  will  exceed  3%  in  the  second 
half  of  this  year,  standing  around  4%  for  a  few  months.  It  will  later  fluctuate  around  3% 
through  2011  until  the  end  of  the  relevant  projection  horizon,  which  is  currently  the  first 
quarter of 2012. Annual CPIX1 will show a more gradual convergence to 3% (table 2). All this 
within a substantially more uncertain setting than before. 
This scenario rests on other working assumptions. First, it is assumed that in the long term 
the  real  exchange  rate  (RER)  will  be  similar  to  its  current  level.  This  assumption  is  made 
considering  that,  with  the  nominal  exchange  rate  and  parities  prevailing  at  the  statistical 
closure  of  this  Report,  the  RER  is  consistent  with  its  long-term  fundamentals.  Another 
working  assumption  is  that  inflationary  pressures  from  the  labour  market  will  generally  not 
experience  any  significant  change  with  respect  to  current  indicators.  Finally,  the  external 
scenario will continue to add momentum to the economy and imported inflationary pressures 
will remain contained. World growth projections for the period 2010–2011 have been revised 
upward and commodity prices will remain near current levels (table 3). 
The  above  projections  include  the  assumption  that  monetary  policy  will  remain  very 
expansive in the following quarters. Towards the end of the projection horizon, the monetary 
policy  rate  will  converge  to  a  level  similar  to  the  one  indicated  by  March’s  Economic 
Expectations Survey. However, its pace of normalization will be somewhat faster than what 
was considered in that survey. It is important to consider that, until the last week of February, 
market expectations for the MPR indicated that its upward phase would begin in the second 
quarter and that the rate would stand between 2.5 and 3.0 percent by the end of the year. 
After  the  earthquake  and  tsunami,  the  expectations  of  analysts  and  survey  respondents 
about the level of the MPR and its velocity of increase fell. In particular, the expected level for 
the MPR for the end of 2010 stands in the 2.0–2.5 percent range (figure 8). 
As  usual,  the  scenario outlined  here  is  subject  to  several  risks.  Compared  with  December 
forecasts, the recovery process and development prospects for the Chilean economy have 
not  been  hindered  by  the  earthquake  and  tsunami;  however,  in  the  short  run,  the  risk 
scenarios are dominated by the catastrophe. Particularly relevant is the medium term effect 
of the aggregate demand impulse originating in the reconstruction works that will be carried 
out. The magnitude, composition, speed, form of financing and focus of these reconstruction 
expenditures  can  have  substantial  effects  on  the  baseline  scenario  in  terms  of  output, 
BIS Review 61/2010 
 5
inflation and the performance of financial markets. There are also risks associated with the 
time that it will take for productive activities to return to normal and for agents to materialize 
their expenditures. This has a direct incidence on the assessment of the immediate effects of 
the  catastrophe  in  the  first  and  second  quarters.  In  any  case,  this  risk  is  partly  mitigated 
when  considering  that  before  the  earthquake  and  tsunami,  domestic  output  and  demand 
were already showing a higher velocity than had been forecast. 
The  external  scenario  shows  a  better  outlook,  although  some  risks  persist.  The  fiscal 
situation  of  developed  economies  –  especially  in  some  European  countries  –  is  cause  for 
concern because of its effects on the perception of risks and on the financial system, and its 
possible  implications  on  the  path  of  recovery  of  global  growth.  There  are  also  risks 
associated  with  the  administration  of  monetary  stimulus  packages,  either  if  they  are 
withdrawn  sooner  than  necessary  –  considering  that  some  countries’  financial  systems 
remain weak – or later than advisable. As usual, the persistence of global imbalances entails 
risks because of both strong capital inflows to emerging economies and significant changes 
in the evolution of currency parities. 
The  realization  of  some  of  these  risk  scenarios  will  have  direct  consequences  on  the 
country’s growth and inflation forecasts. Considering the issues described above, the Board 
believes  that  the  balance  of  risks  for  inflation  and  growth  is  unbiased.  However,  on  this 
occasion, the earthquake and tsunami introduce unusual uncertainty, particularly regarding 
economic  activity  data  for  March  and  April.  Thus,  the  Board  considers  that  the  balance  of 
risks  for  growth  is  biased  downwards  in  the  very  short  term.  Accordingly,  the  Board  will 
continue  to  use  its  policies  with  flexibility  so  that  projected  inflation  stands  at  3%  over  the 
policy horizon. 
Conclusions 
I would like to wrap up this presentation with some brief reflections. Fifty years ago, in May 1960, 
our  country  was  also  hurt  by  a  big  catastrophe.  The  earthquake  in  Valdivia  caused  the 
destruction of a large area in central-southern Chile, comparable only to the recent disaster. 
Human  and  material  losses  were  aggravated  by  a  severe  macroeconomic  maladjustment 
following  the  disaster.  Weak  fiscal  accounts  and  monetary  management  led  to  neglect 
control of inflation, which soared in the following years. 
Our  current  situation  is  certainly  different.  Fiscal  accounts  are  in  order,  and  our  monetary 
policy scheme, as I have already mentioned, has the virtue of allowing us to accommodate 
shocks  without  compromising  the  inflation  objective.  Although  so  far  we  have  no  statistics 
and  preliminary  data  will  be  known  in  the  coming  days,  it  is  possible  that  the  immediate 
reaction to this tragedy will include a temporary increase in inflation and a sharp deceleration 
of economic activity, both as consequences of the major disruptions in productive processes 
and commercialization channels. 
Even before knowing these figures, what our monetary policy strategy suggests and allows 
us to do, is to avoid overreacting to short-term fluctuations. The conduct of monetary policy, 
especially  in  moments  of  uncertainty  like  the  one  we  are  currently  experiencing,  must 
anticipate longer-term tendencies. Thus, while in the first and second quarter output will not 
be as dynamic as it was through January, in the medium term the reconstruction efforts and 
the normalization of output and demand will provide a strong impulse to the economy. The 
marginal productivity of the capital stock that must be recovered is high, and all the activities 
associated with the production of non-tradable goods, such as construction, will face a large 
increase  in  demand.  The  main  contribution  that  monetary  policy  can  make  is  to  ensure  a 
stable environment for reconstruction works to proceed without straining our economy.  
Evidence found in the international literature indicates that natural disasters have permanent 
negative  effects  only  in  low-income  economies.  It  also  shows  that,  although  these  are 
essentially  exogenous  phenomena,  the  magnitude  of  their  effects  is  endogenous  to  the 
6 
 BIS Review 61/2010
scenario, with factors such as the quality of policies and institutions tending to mitigate the 
damages. Chile has solid institutions and an economic policy framework that allows for the 
implementation of any measures necessary for reconstruction. As a result, the catastrophe of 
last  February  27  does  not  compromise  our  country’s  prospects  for  progress  and 
development. 
The projections presented in this Report foresee that this year the economy will grow again, 
and that output gaps will narrow further until closed in 2011. Monetary policy will remain very 
expansive in the coming quarters, which will decisively support the reconstruction process. At 
the same time, however, it will adjust in order to ensure that the process will take place within 
a context of stability and consistency with the inflation target. 
We should bear in mind that history, especially the last couple of years, has taught us the 
importance of price stability and how painful inflation is for the less privileged segments of 
our society. In addition, history has taught us that with volatile inflation comes a more volatile 
business cycle, which is very costly in terms of employment and output. Because of this, it is 
essential  that  the  monetary  stimulus  complies  with  its  role  of  backing  the  reconstruction 
efforts within a context of stable prices. Nothing will be gained by fostering a reconstruction 
that at the end will only translate into higher inflation with no benefits on the productive side 
and with negative implications for key relative prices such as the real exchange rate and real 
interest  rates.  That  could  become  the  prelude  to  costlier  adjustments  in  the  future.  Our 
monetary policy has already given proof of its high capacity to adapt to drastic changes in 
macroeconomic conditions and this latest shock will not be the exception. 
Thank you very much.
