Stefan Ingves: Monetary policy and financial stability – some future 
challenges 
Speech by Mr Stefan Ingves, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, to the Swedish Economics 
Association, Stockholm, 17 May 2010. 
 Every once in a while, developments take a course that turns old truths on their heads and 
forces  new  solutions.  This  is  what  happened  in  Sweden  in  conjunction  with  the  economic 
crisis at the start of the 1990s, when the policy of a fixed exchange rate reached the end of 
the road. At that point, we were lucky enough to be able to change track and become one of 
the very first countries to start to apply an innovation in the field of monetary policy – inflation 
targeting.  
In much the same way, the financial crisis, not yet a completely closed chapter, has come to 
function as a catalyst for reassessment and renewal – not just at home this time, but also on 
an international level. The spotlight has primarily been focused on the work of maintaining 
financial stability – but the crisis has also raised the issue of whether there may be lessons to 
be learned for monetary policy too.  
Today, I plan to discuss some of the challenges that I believe central banks will face in the 
future.  These  challenges  exist  both  in  the  work  on  financial  stability  and  in  the  field  of 
monetary policy – and in the borderland between the two. Indeed, developments in recent 
years have demonstrated that monetary policy and financial stability, in many ways, are more 
intimately connected than we may previously have imagined. One of the challenges I intend 
to  address  today  deals  with  the  difficulty  of  assessing  the  effects  on  potential  output  and 
growth  of  the  financial  crisis  and  the  regulations  following  in  its  wake.  Another  challenge 
concerns  the  impact  of  these  regulations  on  monetary  policy’s  transmission  mechanism. 
Finally, I will also discuss the possibility of preventing a credit-driven property boom. 
One  highly  current  and  significant  challenge  is  that  of  preventing  the  central  government 
finance problems primarily facing Greece, but also a number of other countries, from leading 
to new problems on the financial markets. The solution to this must primarily be sought on 
the international political level. This is a matter both of implementing measures to maintain 
confidence and of solving the most acute problems. The comprehensive support package for 
countries  with  serious  budget  problems,  recently  presented  by  the  EU  countries  and 
International Monetary  Fund, should be considered one such measure. Of course, a  more 
lasting  solution  will  also  require  the  problem  to  be  tackled  at  its  root  –  for  the  regulatory 
framework for central government finances to be reviewed so that similar situations can be 
avoided in the future. Discussions on how best to do this have also been initiated. Hopefully, 
this  will  be  enough  to  restore  calm  and  for  the  process  of  recovery  and  normalisation 
following the financial crisis to continue. I do not intend to say much more about the unfolding 
situation  other  than  that  we  are  naturally  following  developments  very  carefully  and,  as 
always, are prepared to act to safeguard financial stability, should such action be necessary.  
Allow me, therefore, to return to the more general discussion I had originally intended to hold. 
However, before proceeding further, I would like to point out that the thoughts I present here 
are my own. My colleagues on the Executive Board do not necessarily analyse matters in 
completely the same manner as I do. I would also like to emphasise that my ambition is to 
illustrate  different  ideas  in  an  intuitive  manner,  without  attempting  to  propose  any  cut-and-
dried solutions.

Monetary policy has developed 
Let me start by looking back on how monetary policy has developed in Sweden and other 
countries over the last fifteen to twenty years. As I have already mentioned, we were one of 
the  first  central  banks  to  introduce  inflation  targeting.  When  we  started  in  1993,  our  only 
forerunners  were  the  central  banks  of  New  Zealand,  Canada  and  the  United  Kingdom. 
Today,  inflation  targeting  is  applied  in  approximately  twenty-five  countries.1  Furthermore, 
many  other  central  banks  have  adopted  essential  elements  of  inflation  targeting,  such  as 
setting price stability as the overriding goal, basing the policy on forward assessments and 
publishing regular reports to provide relatively comprehensive explanations of the reasoning 
used.  
Also  within  the  framework  of  inflation  targeting,  the  manner  in  which  monetary  policy  has 
been conducted has seen some development over the years as experience and knowledge 
have increased. For quite a long period of time, monetary policy in Sweden took guidance 
from a rule reading approximately as follows: 
“If the forecast for inflation two years ahead exceeds the inflation target – raise the repo rate. 
If the forecast falls below the target – decrease the repo rate.” (Figure 1).

  This simple rule had a number of advantages, above all in the communication of monetary 
policy decisions. For example, it clearly indicated that inflation was the overriding goal and 
that monetary policy had to be forward-looking. These were important points to make when 
the  inflation-targeting  regime  was  new.  However,  in  many  ways,  this  presented  an 
excessively  simplified  view  of  monetary  policy.  One  weakness  was  that  the  forecasts  for 
inflation and the other variables were based on the assumption that the repo rate would be 
held unchanged for the entire forecast period. This assumption was often quite unrealistic, 
for example during a strong economic upturn with rising inflation, when an increase in the 
repo  rate  was  widely  expected.  Consequently,  it  could  be  difficult  to  reconcile  this 
assumption of an unchanged repo rate with credible and consistent forecasts.2

Fund. 
It can be demonstrated that an incentive arises for the central bank to deviate from the unchanged repo rate 
as time passes and the forecast horizon is moved ahead, even if the forecast was initially on target two years 
ahead and no new information has been received. For a more in-depth discussion of this time inconsistency 
problem, see for example Kai Leitemo, “Targeting Inflation by Constant-Interest-Rate Forecasts”, Journal of 
Money, Credit and Banking 35, August 2003.

 Today, our reasoning is somewhat different. We attempt to determine a forecast path for the 
future repo rate that entails that monetary policy is, as we often put it, well-balanced. A well-
balanced  monetary  policy  is  normally  a  matter  of  finding  an  appropriate  balance  between 
stabilising inflation around the inflation target and stabilising the real economy, that is to say, 
production and employment. One way of illustrating this balance is to say that the deviations 
arising  during  the  forecast  period  between,  on  one  hand,  inflation  and  the  inflation  target, 
and,  on  the  other,  the  real  economy  and  a  trend,  may  not  become  altogether  too  great 
(Figure 2). As a measure of deviations in the real economy, the output gap is often used – 
that  is  to  say,  the  difference  between  actual  production  and  the  economy’s  long-term 
production capacity or potential output.

  That  the  Riksbank  does  not  only  care  about  inflation,  but  also  about  the  real  economy,  is 
nothing  new.  We  have  done  so  more  or  less  right  from  the  very  start,  even  if,  when  the 
inflation-targeting regime was new, there was particular reason to emphasise that low and 
stable inflation should be prioritised. However, in the present framework, the considerations 
that  we  actually  make  as  regards  both  inflation  and  the  real  economy  have  become  more 
apparent.  
However, a number of problems still remain. For example, it is not obvious which measure of 
the  real  economy  monetary  policy  is  to  stabilise  nor  how  best  to  calculate  the  trend  to  be 
stabilised  around.  Quite  different  estimates  can  be  made,  not  only  in  terms  of  the  present 
and the future, but also of past events (Figure 3). However, it remains clear that intellectual 
progress has been made and that developments have moved forwards. 
So far, relatively few central banks have gone so far as to publish forecasts of their policy 
rates,  as  the  Riksbank  does.  But  it  is  clear  that  the  manner  in  which  monetary  policy  is 
conducted has developed in most parts of the world and is presently more open and clear 
than was the case fifteen to twenty years ago.

 Monetary policy has contributed to increased macroeconomic stability 
The trend towards inflation targeting, or policies resembling inflation targeting, and increased 
openness  and  clarity  has  had  positive  results.  In  Sweden  and  other  countries  affected  by 
high  and  fluctuating  inflation  during  the  1970s  and  1980s,  inflation  has  become  lower  and 
more  stable.  Similarly,  inflation  expectations  have  been  significantly  better  anchored  than 
before  (Figure  4).  In  these  cases,  I  believe  that  countries  with  explicit,  quantified  inflation 
targets  have  had  a  particular  advantage.  These  days,  actual  inflation  can  differ  quite 
considerably  from  the  inflation  target,  for  example  due  to  temporary  increases  in  energy 
prices, without households and companies finding it particularly alarming. They rely on the 
Riksbank to return inflation to target within a couple of years.

More or less at the same time as inflation decreased and started fluctuating less, growth also 
became more stable. This increased macroeconomic stability was a more or less worldwide 
phenomenon,  being  generally  known  as  “The  Great  Moderation”.  There  exist  various 
hypotheses  on  what  may  lie  behind  this  increased  stability.  One  of  them  is  that  monetary 
policy had started to be conducted in an improved manner, in which an emphasis on low and 
stable inflation allowed inflation expectations to be better anchored. If actual and expected 
inflation  vary  less,  this  will  entail  fewer  variations  in  real  interest  rates  and  real  exchange 
rates. This may, in turn, allow for the more stable development of demand and, thereby, the 
real economy. Well-anchored inflation expectations also make it easier for monetary policy to 
BIS Review 68/2010

stabilise the economy. Unless households and companies immediately adjust their inflation 
expectations  upwards,  a  minor  increase  in  the  interest  rate  will  be  enough  to  prevent  an 
inflationary impulse from becoming entrenched. And when substantial interest rate changes 
become less necessary, fluctuations in the real economy become less extensive than when 
inflation  expectations  are  poorly  anchored.  One  way  of  putting  it  is  that  well-anchored 
inflation  expectations  make  it  easier  for  central  banks  to  take  consideration  of  the  real 
economy.  
For Sweden’s part, one important explanation for the increased macroeconomic stability is 
probably also that inflation targeting – together with a more long-term focus for fiscal policy – 
spelled  the  end  of  the  uneven  “stop-go”  policy  entailed  by  the  many  devaluations  of  the 
1970s and 1980s. Quite simply, the stabilisation policy has shown more orderliness. 
To  sum  up,  the  manner  in  which  monetary  policy  is  conducted  across  the  world  has  thus 
changed  quite  extensively  in  the  last  fifteen  to  twenty  years.  Within  both  the  central  bank 
world  and  among  academic  researchers,  a  great  deal  of  effort  has  been  expended  upon 
attempting  to  find  a  solution  for  how  monetary  policy  best  should  be  formulated.  These 
efforts  have  also  borne  fruit.  In  most  areas,  inflation  has  fallen  significantly  and  has  been 
more  stable  than  previously.  The  real  economy  also  seemed  to  be  developing  with  more 
stability, which was probably partly due to the fact that the policy was being conducted in a 
better  reasoned  manner  than  previously.  There  may  be  those  who  believed  that  most 
problems had been solved, and that the improved stability of the macroeconomy was here to 
stay. But the Great Moderation would turn out to be a deceptive calm. 
But an improved monetary policy was not enough 
The recent period has seen frequent discussion of the financial crisis and its causes, to put it 
mildly. Consequently, I do not intend to go into any detailed description of the development of 
the crisis, but will remain on a relatively intuitive level. The origin of the financial crisis lay in a 
number of interacting macroeconomic and microeconomic factors. However, the core of the 
crisis was that the banks and other participants took on too much debt in relation to the risks 
they  were  taking.  Shortcomings  in  the  regulatory  framework,  combined  with  a  lack  of 
understanding of new complex financial instruments, contributed towards the altogether too 
low  pricing  of  risk  by  the  market.  Regulatory  frameworks  and  supervision  also  failed  to 
ensure  that  the  banks  had  enough  high-quality  capital  to  maintain  confidence  when  the 
economy took a downward turn and inflated asset values fell. Neither did the banks have a 
sufficient  liquidity  buffer  to  manage  their  short-term  funding  in  an  environment  in  which 
confidence  in  banks  in  general  was  being  questioned  and  previously  liquid  assets  were 
suddenly  becoming  illiquid.  The  banks,  quite  simply,  lacked  sufficient  resilience.  When 
Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in the autumn of 2008, an acute crisis of confidence 
arose in the financial system. Only massive efforts from central banks and authorities across 
the world could prevent a collapse. 
Paradoxically  enough,  the  fairly  long  period  of  macroeconomic  stability  preceding  the 
financial  crisis  may  partially  have  contributed  towards  making  the  crisis  as  deep  as  it 
became. When things have gone well for a long period of time it is probably human nature to 
relax and become slightly less cautious. Without oversimplifying matters, I think it could be 
said that this was something that characterised not only investors and financial institutions 
but also supervisory authorities and political decision-makers during this period. 
Even if the financial crisis has triggered a new wave of thinking regarding the central banks 
and their activities, I would like to point out that in no way do I consider that the development 
of  monetary  policy  over  the  last  fifteen  to  twenty  years  has  been  misguided  or  a  waste  of 
time. On the contrary, I am convinced that the policy that gradually developed will continue to 
contribute  towards  more  stable  development  in  the  future.  Even  so,  it  is  clear  that  the 
financial crisis functioned as a wake-up call in many ways. It showed that there existed areas 
in  which  we  needed  to  think  further  or  maybe  even  revitalise  old  knowledge.  Not  least,  it 
6 
 BIS Review 68/2010
made  it  apparent  that,  while  central  banks  had  become  more  adept  at  handling  normal 
shocks  to  demand  and  supply,  there  remained  a  great  deal  to  be  learned  regarding  the 
manner in which imbalances on the financial markets ought to be handled. 
So what consequences can we expect the crisis to have for central banks’ method of working 
in the future? Is there reason to supplement current monetary policy reasoning – and, if so, 
how? A large part of what I will address here today consists of matters that are currently the 
subject of intensive international discussion. The final result of these discussions remains to 
be seen. Nonetheless, let me think aloud on the manner in which central banks’ work may be 
affected and on the challenges we will face. 
Effects on potential output and growth? 
One challenge concerns attempting to assess the manner in which the crisis will affect the 
economy’s  long-term  production  capacity  or  potential  output.  This  is  significant  for  several 
reasons.  Firstly,  the  deviation  between  actual  and  potential  output,  the  output  gap,  is  a 
measure of the stability of the real economy. Secondly, the output gap can affect the manner 
in which inflation develops. If the production of an economy exceeds its long-term production 
capacity (that is to say, if the output gap is positive), this tends to exert upwards pressure on 
inflation. The opposite applies if the output gap is negative. For a central bank with a price 
stability target, it is thus useful to have a good idea of the long-term production capacity. If, 
for example, it is believed to be higher than is actually the case, an excessively loose policy 
may be being conducted, in the belief that there are spare resources in the economy. This 
may  cause  inflation  to  rise.  One  hypothesis  about  why  inflation  in  the  United  States 
increased  so  much  during  the  1970s  is  indeed that  the  Federal  Reserve  believed  that  the 
economy’s long-term production capacity was higher than was actually the case.3  
To  a  certain  extent,  this  is  a  “traditional”  challenge  in  the  sense  that,  after  each  deep 
recession,  it  must  be  asked  whether  potential  output  may  have  fallen  and,  if  so,  by  how 
much.  Potential  output  may  fall  as  a  consequence  of  permanent  loss  of  real  capital  when 
companies are forced into liquidation or when dismissed personnel have difficulty in finding 
new work when economic activity turns upwards again. Following the crisis at the start of the 
1990s,  assessments  of  this  nature  were  a  central  feature  of  forecasting  work.  Of  course, 
estimating the extent of the output gap is no easy task. As I have already mentioned, it is 
possible to arrive at fairly disparate estimates even under normal circumstances when there 
is no reason to suspect a fall in potential output. 
Looking  forward,  another  aspect  also  exists  that  may  be  more  specific  to  this  crisis  in 
particular.  One  consequence  of  the  financial  crisis  is  that,  in  the  future,  we  will  see  more 
regulation  of  banks  and  the  financial  sector  in  general.  The  fundamental  aim  of  these 
regulations is, of course, to reduce the likelihood and effects of crises of the type we have 
just  experienced.  These  increased  requirements  will  probably  lead  to  increased  prices  for 
financial services, slightly higher lending rates to households and companies, and a slightly 
lower credit supply. One way of putting it could be that these costs are a kind of insurance 
premium that society is willing to pay to avoid financial crises or to considerably reduce the 
risk of them. 
However, at the same time, it should be borne in mind that these regulations could impact 
the economy’s potential output and growth. If the regulations are too far-reaching, they may 
have a negative impact on the efficiency and growth potential of the financial sector. It is true 
that the significance for growth of the financial sector is not entirely clear, but the possibility 
                                                 
3  See,  for  example  Athanasios  Orphanides,  “Monetary  Policy  Rules  and  the  Great  Inflation”,  American 
Economic Review Papers and Proceedings 92:2, May 2002.

that  an  “over-regulated”  financial  sector  could  contribute  to  lower  potential  growth  in  the 
economy as a whole can hardly be ruled out.  
For central banks and other economic forecasters, the challenge will be to attempt to make 
the  best  assessment  possible  of  the  manner  in  which  potential  output  and  growth  may  be 
impacted by both the crisis and the regulations resulting from it. For the authorities that are to 
design the regulations, the challenge will lie in finding an appropriate balance: on one hand, 
the  regulations  will  need  to  be  sufficient  to  reduce  the  risk  of  financial  crises  –  which  can 
cause  potential  output  to  fall.  However,  on  the  other  hand,  they  should  not  be  so 
comprehensive  as  to  impede  the  financial  sector  unnecessarily,  thus  risking  dampening 
potential growth. In other words, it is a matter of finding just the right level of regulation.  
Figure 5

Somewhat simplified, it could be said that this is a matter of making a choice between two 
development  paths  for  potential  output  (Figure  5).  In  one,  development  is  interrupted  now 
and  again  by  crises,  during  which  potential  output  falls,  but  between  these,  growth  is 
relatively strong. In the other, development is even, but growth may be slightly lower than is 
the case between crises in the first development path. It is not obvious which development 
provides  the  best  welfare  effects  over  the  long  term,  but  it  is  clear  that  general  opinion  at 
present is that we should attempt to reduce the risk of crises and abrupt halts. I am quite 
certain  that most  observers  deem  that  this  would  also  provide  better  growth  over  the  long 
term. 
How will regulation affect monetary policy’s transmission mechanism? 
Another  consequence  of  the  regulation  agenda is  that  what  is  usually  known  as  monetary 
policy’s transmission mechanism may look slightly different in the future. More specifically, 
the  connection  between  the  central  banks’  policy  rates  and  the  interest  rates  affecting 
households and companies may change.  
A stable transmission mechanism is usually an underlying assumption in economic models. 
This  is  probably  a  fairly  good  approximation  under  normal  circumstances,  but,  during  the 
crisis, it became necessary to reassess this assumption. The impact of monetary policy was 
affected by a decline in willingness to take risks and the impaired functioning of the interbank 
markets (Figure 6).

A  simplified  illustration  of  this  can  be  provided  by  describing  the  banks’  lending  rate  as  a 
function of the central bank’s policy rate plus an interest rate margin or spread:  
i
lending
t

t
i
t
  
The  interest  rate  margin  (
t )  is  a  function  of  the  compensation  taken  by  the  banks  for 
administrative costs and capital costs, risk premiums, the banks’ profit margins, and loan-to-
value  and  amortisation requirements.  Loan-to-value  and  amortisation requirements  are  not 
directly  visible  in  the  interest  rate  applied  to  the  customer,  but,  in  order  to  illustrate  their 
effects  on  an  aggregated  level,  these  can  be  recalculated  in  terms  of  interest  relatively 
simply.  
When risk propensity fell during the financial crisis, the interest rate margin increased as a 
consequence of both higher risk premiums and lower loan-to-value ratios. This counteracted 
the  cut  in  the  policy  rate.  When  central  banks  and  governments  subsequently  adopted 
various measures to increase confidence on the markets, risk premiums fell in a similar way. 
The lending rate thus fell without a change in the policy rate being required.  
Now, it is not only during a crisis that there exists reason to consider the financial sector’s 
significance  for  the  transmission  mechanism.  As  I  have  just  discussed,  one  of  the 
consequences of a crisis is that the regulations of banks and other institutions will become 
more stringent. The intention of this is to reduce the socioeconomic costs that can result from 
banking.  However,  there  is  also  reason  to  consider  how  the  regulations  introduced  could 
affect the impact of monetary policy.  
These regulations usually entail an increased cost for the banks which, to a certain extent, is 
passed along to customers in the form of an increased interest rate margin. This could be 
seen as a sort of “regulation premium”. This premium can also be seen as the price to be 
BIS Review 68/2010

paid  by  households  and  companies  for  more  stable  real  economic  development  as 
represented  by  the  broken  curve  in  Figure  5.  This  concept  can  be  illustrated  with  the 
equation for the lending rate by adding a variable ( z ) designating regulations affecting the 
interest rate margin: 
i
lending
t

t
i
t
)(z
  
I would like to emphasise that this equation is, of course, a simplification. However, as my 
focus  today  is  on  the  correlation  of  interest  rates  and  regulations,  this  description  will  be 
facilitated by viewing regulations as a kind of “shadow interest rate”, even if they can also be 
analysed in terms of the supply of credit. If regulations become more stringent, the interest 
rate margin and thus the lending rate both increase.  
New regulations will not be introduced until we have emerged completely from the crisis, and 
they  will  be  introduced successively.  The  end result  will  probably  be  a  higher  interest  rate 
margin than was the case prior to the introduction of the regulations. In principle, this can be 
seen as a “one-off shift” upwards in the interest rate margin. Adjustment to this higher level 
may  be  more  or  less  protracted,  depending  on  the  rate  at  which  the  regulations  are 
implemented  and  the  degree  towards  which  they  are  expected  by  the  market.  During  this 
period of adjustment, the transmission mechanism will be affected. 
One criticism of the regulatory framework and supervision of the financial area was that, prior 
to the crisis, these focused excessively upon individual institutions. The assumption was that 
the  system  would  remain  stable  as  long  as  the  individual  institutions  were  stable. 
Consequently, processes creating risks on the system level were ignored – processes such 
as a general underpricing of risk, the increased element of short-term market funding and the 
increasingly 
the 
components  in  macroprudential  policy,  the  package  of  more  explicit  systemic  crisis 
preventative  regulations  being  discussed  internationally,  is  the  more  active  application  of 
regulations to dampen risk-building tendencies and build buffers when times are good. One 
specific  proposal  is  to  allow  the  capital  requirement  for  the  banks  to  vary  over  time.  This 
would entail a division of the total capital requirement into two components. The first of these 
would  be  a  constant  minimum  requirement  to  establish  the  amount  of  capital  a  bank  is 
always to hold. To this can be added a further capital requirement that varies over time by 
being linked to a suitable indicator of, for example, credit growth or cyclical position of the 
economy (Figure 7).

When economic activity is strong, the capital requirement is high, and vice versa. This time-
varying capital requirement has two functions. The first is to build up the bank’s capital buffer 
when times are good and then let this buffer decrease during less favourable periods. The 
second function is to dampen credit growth when times are good by increasing the capital 
requirement and thereby the bank’s lending costs. This increase in the bank’s lending costs 
in turn implies an increase in the interest rate margin – and thus the lending rate.  
In  light  of  the  discussion  of  “just  the  right  level  of  regulation”,  a  time-varying  capital 
requirement and other regulations varying across time may have certain advantages. Their 
more apparent connection with risk build-up may make them less costly than the alternative 
of introducing a constant higher “minimum requirement”.  
One objective of varying regulations across time is to affect credit growth through the interest 
rate margin. This creates an additional source of variation in the interest rate margin, which 
can  be  illustrated  in  the  lending  rate  equation  by  adding  an  additional  time  index  for  the 
regulations:

An  interest  rate  margin  with  time-varying  regulations  also  implies  another  dynamic  for  the 
transmission  mechanism  and  is  more  complicated  than  a  one-off  shift.  Of  course,  this  will 
have implications for monetary policy decision-making, which will become more complex. 
The application of time-varying regulations may also give rise to a more indirect effect on the 
interest  rate  margin.  Just  as  uncertainty  about  the  future  policy  rate  gives  rise  to  a  risk 
premium, so can uncertainty about the manner in which regulation will develop give rise to an 
additional  “regulation  risk  premium”.  It  is  already  possible  to  see  that  the  uncertainty 
prevailing around the proposed tightening of the capital and liquidity regulations – which are 
not  intended  to  vary  over  time  –  is  affecting  both  interest  rate  margins  and  the  supply  of 
credit.  
One  way  of  increasing  predictability  would  be  to  adjust  the  regulations  automatically, 
according to a specific rule, as, for example, is the case with the dynamic provisioning used 
in  Spain.4  However,  I  do  not  consider  it  practically  feasible  to  rely  entirely  upon  automatic 
decision-making rules. Uncertainty surrounding the manner in which regulations may change 
over  time  will  thus  always  remain.  However,  it  may  be  possible  to  learn  lessons  from  the 
experiences  of  monetary  policy  in  order  to  reduce  this  regulation  risk  premium.  Even  if 
monetary  policy  is  essentially  conducted  in  a  discretionary  manner,  economic  agents 
frequently have a fairly good idea of the way in which the interest rate will change. Naturally, 
I would like to believe that this is due to the present openness and clarity of monetary policy. 
Hopefully,  it  will  be  possible  to  achieve  an  equivalent  level  of  openness  and  clarity  in  the 
matter of time-varying regulations. One possibility could be to develop some kind of rule of 
action based on assessments regarding, for example, credit growth. Such a rule would thus 
provide  information  on  whether  the  “regulatory  controls”  needed  to  be  shifted  upwards  or 
downwards. 
Inspired by the Taylor rule that is well-known within monetary policy, the arguments in the 
regulation  could  be  formed  of  the  non-time  varying  regulations  ( z ),  a  measure  of  actual 
credit volume in relation to a level deemed sustainable over the long term
, and the 
output gap:

4   Dynamic provisioning is, in principle, a rule in which banks make specific and general provisions when times 
are good for later use in less favourable periods. These provisions are rule-based and are built upon credit 
stocks and credit flows calibrated by data on average historical loan losses to different sectors.

I  would  like  to  emphasise  that  this  is  intended  as  an  illustration  of  a  so-far  quite  loose 
conception,  rather  than  a  concrete  proposal.  However,  it  is  a  useful  illustration,  not  least 
because  it  indicates  the  comprehensive  development  work  that  will  be  required  before 
anything practically applicable can result. Nonetheless, I believe there are good conditions 
for  development  work  within  this  area  to  result  in  equally  healthy  returns  as  the  efforts 
expended upon developing monetary policy over the last fifteen to twenty years. 
The  application  of  time-varying  regulations  also  raises  the  issue  of  what  would  be  an 
appropriate  form  of  institutional  organisation.  Different  countries  have  chosen  different 
solutions as regards the allocation of responsibility. One common feature is for the central 
bank frequently to have a certain responsibility for financial stability via its role as lender of 
last resort. In certain countries, the central bank also has responsibility for supervision and 
the application of regulations. Meanwhile, in other countries, such as Sweden, responsibility 
for regulatory and supervisory matters is placed with a separate supervisory authority. This 
means  that,  in  Sweden,  it  is  the  Riksbank  that  controls  the  policy  rate  and  the  Swedish 
Financial Supervisory Authority, Finansinspektionen, that controls regulations.  
For  some  time,  a  discussion  has  taken  place  on  the  international  level  regarding  the  role 
central  banks  should  play  in  matters  of  supervision  and  the  application  of  rules.  Ideas 
regarding  the  application  of  more  time-varying  regulations  are  adding  fresh  fuel  to  this 
debate. Utilising the expression for the rule of action above in the equation for the lending 
rate allows different institutional arrangements to be illustrated. In the previous equation for 
the lending rate, the regulations were described as a time-varying variable. However, with a 
rule  of  action,  the  application  of  regulations  itself  becomes  a  function  of  a  number  of 
variables that vary over time:

the  distribution  of 
responsibility  for  assessing  the  variables  in  the  function,  determining  rules  of  action  or 
functional  form  and,  finally,  for  translating  the  function  into  actual  regulations.  The  latter 
would  probably  require  an  element  of  discretionary  decision-making.  One  possibility  would 
be for the central bank to determine the policy rate ( ti ) and for the supervisory authority to 
determine regulations, that is to say both  z  and 
, as is the case in Sweden. Another 
possibility  would  be  for  the  central  bank  not  only  to  determine  the  policy  rate,  but  also  to 
determine the time-varying regulations through taking responsibility for the application of the 
rule  of  action  ( (...)
),  while  the  actual  implementation  of  the  non-time  variable  regulations 
( z ) would be the responsibility of the supervisory authority. A variation of this would be for 
the  central  bank  to  be  completely  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  time-varying 
regulations.  Finally,  there  is  the  possibility  of  the  central  bank  taking  responsibility  for  all 
regulation and supervision.  
At present, it is still too early to say whether the international debate will conclude that one 
form  of  organisation  is  better  than  any  other.  Nonetheless,  regardless  of  the  form  of 
institutional organisation, it seems inevitable that monetary policy and regulatory activities will 
increasingly approach each other.

Can monetary policy prevent a credit-driven property boom?  
One issue that has been discussed for a fairly lengthy period of time, and which has gained 
fresh  impetus  from  the  financial crisis,  concerns  the extent  towards  which  monetary  policy 
should  be  used  to  attempt  to  counteract  a  rapid  increase  of  property  prices  and  credit 
12 
 BIS Review 68/2010
investment  develop  weakly,  and 
volumes. This focus on the property market in particular exists because problems there often 
have greater effects on the financial system and the economy in general than problems on, 
for example, the stock market. 
Allow  me  to  use  the  property  market  as  an  illustration  here  too.  The  dynamic  of  a  credit-
driven increase on the property market can be described as follows. When the price of an 
asset starts to rise, it becomes possible to borrow against that asset for a higher  amount. 
This frees up money to buy more of the asset, but also for consumption. The latter implies 
that  rising  property  prices  may  lead  to  a  credit-driven  consumption  boom.  When  the  price 
increases, there also arises a tendency to regard the asset as being less risky, meaning that 
the credit risk premium decreases and the loan-to-value ratio is allowed to increase. In the 
lending  rate  equation,  this  implies  a  decrease  in  the  interest  rate  margin.  Cheaper  credit 
feeds further price increases, which, in turn, feed further credit expansion, and so on. 
The  situation  one  would  like  to  avoid  is  one  in  which  the  upturn  is  characterised  by 
exaggerated  optimism  and  excessive  risk  propensity.  In  such  a  situation,  the  fall  can  be 
dramatic  when  something  causes  this  sentiment  to  turn.  Prices  fall,  participants  become 
more  pessimistic  and  risk  propensity  decreases  among  both  lenders  and  borrowers.  This 
may result in an extended period during which participants consolidate their balance sheets, 
consumption  and 
lending  becomes  exaggeratedly 
restrictive.  Fluctuations  in  property  prices  and  credit  volumes  can  thus  amplify  the 
fluctuations of the real economy. 
A fall in prices or expectations of such a fall may also lead to financial instability with possible 
consequences in the form of increased uncertainty, a credit crunch and stresses on central 
government  finances.  This  is  because  a  credit-driven  imbalance  can  create  a  significant 
credit risk if the banks have filled the asset side of their balance sheets with loans based on 
inflated prices and with high loan-to-value ratios. The credit risk also depends on the manner 
in  which  borrowers’  obligations  in  the  event  of  a  default  will  be  regulated,  that  is  to  say 
whether the bank will be able to claim only the actual collateral or whether it will also have a 
claim  on  the  remaining  loan.  An  individual  bank  has  no  reason  to  take  consideration  of 
anything other than the risk to its own balance sheet and can, in general, ignore the effects 
on the real economy and financial stability: these are external effects. This “credit expansion 
externality”  implies  a  market  failure  and  may  justify  public  intervention.  As  experience  has 
shown that it is precisely the bursting of property bubbles that has played such a decisive 
role  in  several  financial  crises,  there  exists  reason  to  believe  that  such  credit  expansion 
externality may be particularly great on the property market.  
According to one view, a central bank should try to counteract the increase of property prices 
and  credit  volumes  by  keeping  the  policy  rate  higher  than  would  otherwise  be  necessary 
during the upturn. Central banks should lean against the wind, as this is usually described. 
The idea is that the increase in property prices and credit volumes will thus be smaller, but 
also  that  the  decline,  in  return,  will  be  significantly  less  dramatic  (Figure  8).  If  the 
development  of  property  prices  and  credit  volumes  becomes  more  balanced,  it  is  also 
assumed  that  the  real  economy  and  inflation  will  be  more  stable.  While  growth  will 
undoubtedly be somewhat lower in the upturn, it will, on the other hand, make it possible to 
avoid the deep recession that may be the consequence of a fall in property prices.

One complication arising in this context is that it is not entirely easy to incorporate the risks 
that may be associated with the rapid increase of property prices and credit volumes into the 
normal  work  of  forecasting  and  analysis.  One  difficulty  is,  for  example,  that  the  financial 
sector is often rather underdeveloped in the models used by central banks in their analysis 
work.  At  present,  fairly  intensive  efforts  are  being  made  in  many  areas  to  better  include 
financial variables in the central banks’ forecast models. Another, not unrelated, problem is 
that  property  prices  and  borrowing  are  occasionally  driven  by  psychological  factors  – 
exaggerated  optimism  and  high  risk  propensity  in  upturns  and  the  opposite  effect  in 
downturns. It is, of course, primarily this kind of development that leaning against the wind is 
an attempt to counteract. However, such factors are difficult to capture in economic models, 
as these are often based on the assumption that participants will act in a rational manner. In 
other words, it is difficult for a model to generate a scenario such as that represented by the 
unbroken curve in the figure. Even so, we know that such scenarios occur. It is part of human 
nature to reassure oneself by believing that “this time is different”, which, at the end of the 
day, is seldom the case.5 
The difficulty in making forecasts that capture and quantify the risks that may be associated 
with  a  credit-driven  property  boom  has  meant  that  monetary  policies  that  lean  against  the 
wind are often described as the adoption of “extra action” or the increase of the interest rate 
“over  and  above”  the  forecasts  for  inflation  and  the  real  economy  by  the  central  bank.6  A 
central bank’s decision to act in this manner should not be interpreted – as has sometime 
happened – as indicating that the development of property prices and credit volumes is an 
end in itself of monetary policy. The reason that the central bank is leaning against the wind 
is, of course, that it thereby still expects to achieve a more stable development in the real 
economy and inflation. One could say that the central bank sees property prices and credit 
growth  as  indicators  saying  something  about  the  way  in  which  inflation  and  resource

“This  time  is  different”  is  the  title  of  a  newly  published  book  by  Carmen  Reinhart  and  Kenneth  Rogoff 
(Princeton University Press). The book analyses financial crises occurring over several hundred years. The 
title is a reference to the phenomenon that, even though it is common knowledge that crises occur every now 
and again, there seems to be a tendency to believe that, on just this occasion, there is probably no danger.

utilisation may develop over the longer term. However, it is clear that such a monetary policy 
places great demands upon a central bank’s communications. 
It should be pointed out that the reason that a central bank may wish to lean against the wind 
does not have to be because it only wishes to safeguard financial stability. That may be the 
case,  but  it  may  also  be  a  purely  monetary  policy  decision.  The  bank  may  simply  wish  to 
attempt to avoid severe fluctuations in the real economy and inflation, even if these are not 
deemed to be associated with financial stability problems.  
Leaning  against  the  wind  is  not  a  problem-free  strategy.  Three  primary  counterarguments 
have been put forth.7 Firstly, the imbalance must be identified at a sufficiently early stage. 
Attempting to rectify the imbalance too late may be problematic as monetary policy acts with 
a time lag. If property prices fall steeply immediately following an increase of the policy rate 
by  the  central  bank,  the  delayed  effects  of  the  interest  rate  increase  will  reinforce  the 
negative effects on the economy of the falling property prices. Of course, one must also be 
sufficiently certain that an imbalance really is building up. If the upturn is being caused by 
fundamental factors, a higher interest rate would hinder growth unnecessarily.  
Secondly, one has to rely upon being able to deal with the property price increase through 
reasonable  increases  of  the  policy  rate.  One  hypothesis  is  that  the  optimistic  mood  often 
prevailing during a boom in the property market means that significant increases of the policy 
rate are required to have an effect. Such a tightening of monetary policy could have severe 
negative effects on the rest of the economy.  
Thirdly, at least previously, there existed a view that the negative effects of the bursting of a 
bubble need not be so dramatic, but can be counteracted or considerably mitigated relatively 
painlessly by easing monetary policy, or by other measures.  
These  arguments  have  convinced  some  that  monetary  policy  should  not  lean  against  the 
wind,  but  should  restrict  itself  to  “cleaning  up  afterwards”.  I  am  one  of  those  who  has 
“cleaned  up  afterwards”  in  a  number  of  countries,  and  I  know  how  expensive  and 
complicated  it  can  be.  These  experiences  have  contributed  towards  my  conviction  that 
ending  up  in  such  a  situation  is  something  best  avoided.  This  was  a  point  I  made  at  a 
conference  at  Jackson  Hole  a  few  years  ago,  where  the  theme  was  monetary  policy  and 
asset prices.8 That was before the financial crisis, when criticism of using monetary policy to 
lean against the wind was significantly stronger than it is today. What it ultimately boils down 
to  is  that  if  one  creates  money,  as  a  central  bank  does,  and  this  leads  to  a  high  level  of 
mortgaging of properties, it is difficult to discharge oneself entirely from responsibility for what 
is happening. 
The dramatic effects of the financial crisis have made their mark on the debate. As I interpret 
matters,  it  seems  as  though  advocates  of  the  strategy  of  “cleaning  up  afterwards”  have 
partially modified their view, primarily because the potential profits of limiting bubbles seem 
to be greater than previously estimated. It seems to be an increasingly accepted view that a 
central bank should at least do something when it suspects that a credit-driven imbalance is 
building up on the property market.9 This is not necessarily a matter of increasing the policy 
rate, even if it now seems to be increasingly accepted that this can also be considered.

Can time-varying regulations prevent a credit-driven property boom?  
I  mentioned  earlier  that  an  international  discussion  is  underway  regarding  the  more  time-
varied application of regulations within the framework of macroprudential policy. Even if this 
discussion primarily addresses the prevention of risks to financial stability, it is conceivable 
that the time-varied application of regulations may also be used to prevent a credit expansion 
that  may  destabilise  the  real  economy,  without  any  threat  to  financial  stability  being 
perceived. In the same way as leaning against the wind with the policy rate can be justified 
by monetary policy reasons, so too can a policy that leans against the wind with regulations.  
How, then, would this time-varying application of regulations look in practice? One possibility 
is to raise the capital adequacy requirement, which would raise the interest rate margin and 
thus the lending rate. Higher capital adequacy would also lead the banks to increase their 
buffers and thus improve their resilience to loan losses. Another alternative to increase the 
interest rate margin would be to require a larger proportion of own funds from borrowers by 
setting  a  ceiling  for  leverage  –  such  as,  for  example,  the  ceiling  recently  proposed  by 
Finanzinspektionen – or amortisation requirements. Raising the requirements for own funds 
will primarily strengthen borrowers’ buffers against falling prices, even if lower indebtedness 
will also reduce the banks’ risks. In contrast to capital requirements, the regulations on loan-
to-value and amortisation requirements mean that it will not only become more expensive but 
also more difficult to raise loans. This latter suggests that such regulations could be analysed 
in  terms  of  more  explicit  supply  limits.  However,  today  I  have  decided  to  discuss  loan-to-
value and amortisation requirements in terms of a “shadow interest rate” in order to illustrate 
the connection between quantitative regulations and monetary policy.  
Rather  than  regulations,  an  economist  may  be more  used  to  thinking  in  terms  of Pigovian 
taxes as regards handling negative external effects. Pigovian taxes are common within the 
area of environmental regulation, where they can, for example, take the form of fuel taxes in 
order to put a price on the negative environmental effects of traffic. In the same manner as 
these  taxes  attempt  to  put  a  price  on  the  environment,  it  is  possible  to  imagine  using  a 
Pigovian tax, based, for example, on the banks’ lending, to price – or internalise – negative 
external effects associated with banking. As the banks would pass at least a portion of such 
a tax on to their customers, the effect of this tax on the borrowing rate would be equivalent to 
an increase of the interest rate margin.  
Sweden  recently  introduced  a  stability  charge  to  be  paid  by  the  banks.  This  charge  is 
intended  to  finance  a  stability  fund  to  act  as  a  central  government  financial  buffer  for  the 
costs  that  may  arise  in  a  financial  crisis.  At  present,  the  stability  charge  is  not  risk-
differentiated.  A  charge  that  is  risk-differentiated  in  an  appropriate  manner  to  provide  the 
banks with the incentive to redistribute their activities depending on risk could be seen as a 
type of Pigovian tax.  
It could also be imagined that Pigovian taxes could be used to attempt to correct the cross-
border  external  effects  that  may  arise  in  an  increasingly  integrated  European  banking 
market.  One  example  is  the  Swedish  banks’  lending  activities  in  the  Baltic  which  have 
probably entailed a liquidity risk in foreign currency in Sweden. The presence of a liquidity 
risk reduced confidence in the Swedish banking system in general and led to a disruption to 
the Swedish financial system. If the banks had internalised this liquidity risk, lending in the 
Baltic would probably have been less extensive. 
One  circumstance  that may  be  worth  taking  into  account  here  is  that  the  credit  market,  in 
practice, is not entirely homogenous. One distinction that can be made is to view the credit 
market  as  being  divided  into  a  corporate  market  and  a  household  market.  In  the  recent 
period  in  Sweden,  we  have  seen  ample  evidence  of  the  great  variance  in  developments 
between these two sectors (Figure 9).

 Even  if  certain  factors  affecting  the  lending  rate  are  common  to  these  two  sectors,  for 
example  the  policy  rate,  other  factors  can  be  sector  specific.  In  other  words,  there  is  no 
common interest rate for the corporate sector and the household sector. Consequently, no 
single  equation  can  be  used  to  describe  the  lending  rate  for  all  sectors  in  the  economy. 
Instead, one equation for households (H) and one for firms (F) are needed:

If we suspect that a bubble is building up in one of the two markets, measures can be aimed 
at just that market. This is not possible with the policy rate, as there only exists one policy 
rate in the economy. In other words, both equations have the same “lever”. Regulations or 
charges can also be adjusted on the basis of the aggregated credit growth and, in this case, 
the effect would be rather like an interest rate increase. However, with regulations, it is also 
possible to aim measures in a specific direction and only increase the interest rate margin for 
the market in which credit growth is deemed to constitute a problem. This strategy allows us 
to avoid tightening credit growth for the other sector which does not form a risk, which – all 
other things being equal – reduces the costs of leaning against the wind. One condition for 
the implementation of such targeted measures is, of course, that the rules governing when 
action is to be taken are based on developments in the individual sectors.  
Of course, the time-varied application of such regulation would not be unproblematic. As in 
the  case  of  leaning  with  the  policy  rate,  any  imbalance  must  be  identified  at  a  sufficiently 
early  stage.  Changing  the  regulation  too  late  will  contribute  more  towards  making  the  fall 
greater  than  braking  the  build-up  of  the  imbalance.  Neither  do  we  have  much  practical 
experience of using regulations to prevent bubbles – even if it should be mentioned that we 
actually  do  not  have  particularly  much  experience  of  using  policy  rate  increases  for  that 
BIS Review 68/2010 
 17
purpose either. Consequently, it may be difficult to determine the appropriate “dosage”. One 
potentially fairly serious problem with regulations is that experience has shown us that it is 
relatively  easy  to  circumvent  them.  Possibilities  for  regulatory  arbitrage  can  be  particularly 
great  when  the  regulatory  framework  is  applied  in  a  more  differentiated  manner.  The  role 
played by the “shadow banking system” in this crisis is an example of the consequences of 
circumventing regulations.  
Is a combination of policy rate and regulation needed? 
I mentioned earlier that it seems as though more and more are advocating that something 
may need to be done when it seems as though a credit-driven imbalance is building up. I do 
not believe that the increasing popularity of this view has so much to do with the fact that the 
identification of an excessive credit expansion is now considered to be easier. Neither is it 
because we have identified tools that can effectively and accurately brake an unsustainable 
credit growth. Rather, I believe that it is due to society’s increased unwillingness to live with 
the  real  economic  risks  entailed  by  such  imbalances.  In  other  words,  it  stems  from  an 
increased acceptance of paying a certain price over the short term in order to reduce the risk 
of a particularly unfavourable outcome later on. However, the question remains of what this 
“something”  that  can  dampen  the  build-up  of  imbalances  could  be.  Should  we  deploy  the 
weapons of the policy rate, of regulations or of a combination of the two?  
The  answer  to  this  question  largely  depends  upon  the  view  taken  of  the  efficiency  of  the 
policy  rate  and  regulations  respectively  as  regards  dampening  excessive  credit  growth.  It 
also depends upon the consequences arising for inflation and the real economy in various 
time perspectives if the policy rate or regulation, respectively, are used. Both the policy rate 
and  regulations  have  their  advantages  and  disadvantages.  The  policy  rate  is  a  blunt 
instrument in so far as it impacts all lending in the economy, which can be seen in the two 
interest rate equations for companies and households, respectively. It can require decision-
makers  to  make  difficult  choices  and  is  a  tough  challenge  to  communicate.  It  is  probably 
quite difficult to explain that the policy rate is being increased to safeguard stability in inflation 
and the real economy further ahead, even though everything looks good in a more short-term 
perspective. This task is not made any easier when policy rate increases impact sectors in 
which credit growth is not deemed to pose any problem. At the same time, the very bluntness 
of the policy rate is one of its strengths compared with regulations. As the policy rate impacts 
the cost situation in the economy in general, it is difficult to circumvent it in the same manner 
as  regulations  can  be  avoided.  On  the  other  hand,  regulations  can  be  applied  in  a  more 
differentiated manner, which can mean that they will be a less costly way to lean against the 
wind.  Another  advantage  is  that  regulations  increase  resilience  by  building  buffers,  for 
example  in  the  form  of  capital.  Consequently,  neither  the  policy  rate  nor  regulations  are 
preferable in all situations. The conclusion I have reached is that a combination of policy rate 
and regulations may be the most practical path.  
Concluding remarks 
The financial crisis has exposed problems and shortcomings, much as crises often do. As I 
see  matters,  this  is  not  a  decisive  blow  for  the  prevailing  order,  as  far  as  monetary  policy 
goes. I still believe that the best model is an inflation targeting policy conducted in an open 
and clear manner, and in which the work of clarification and development continue apace. 
However, it is obvious that we need to learn more about how financial imbalances should be 
handled, and that the crisis will have consequences for central banks’ methods of working.  
I have attempted to present a picture of a few of the challenges I see ahead. By necessity, 
this picture is quite sketchy and has been painted with broad brushstrokes. The final practical 
consequences of the intensive discussion currently being held cannot be predicted with any 
certainty at present. In many respects, this will be a matter of trial and error and, quite simply,

seeing  which  solutions  seem  to  work.  One  step  in  that  direction  is  Finansinspektionen’s 
recent  decision  to  recommend  a  ceiling  for  the  loan-to-value  ratio  of  new  mortgages. 
Something that can, however, be said with certainty is that we will probably never completely 
be able to prevent financial crises – here, history speaks all too clearly. But I do believe that 
now, when our awareness of the problems is unusually great, we have the chance to design 
regulations and frameworks that will at least make these crises a little rarer and a little less 
dramatic.
