Caleb M Fundanga: Fourth quarter 2010 media briefing 
Presented  by  Dr  Caleb  M  Fundanga,  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Zambia,  Lusaka, 
18 February 2011. 
 Executive summary 
1.  
This brief examines monetary policy implementation and its outcomes in the fourth 
quarter of 2010. The brief also reviews other economic and financial sector developments, 
and concludes with an inflation outlook for the first quarter of 2011. 
Monetary policy 
2.  
The focus of monetary policy during the fourth quarter of 2010 continued to be the 
achievement  of  the  end-year  annual  inflation  target  of  8.0%.  In  this  regard,  the  Bank  of 
Zambia  utilised  largely  Open  Market  Operations  to  maintain  reserve  money  within  the 
programmed growth path. This was supported by the auctioning of Government securities.  
Inflation 
3.  
Quarterly  overall  inflation  increased  to  2.5%  in  December  2010  from  1.6%  in  the 
third quarter, and was above the 2.3% recorded in December 2009. This outturn was mainly 
attributed to the rise in food inflation to 3.6% from –0.1% in the previous quarter, as non-food 
inflation slowed down to 1.5% from 3.2% during the same period. 
4.  
Similarly, the annual overall inflation rate rose to 7.9% in December 2010 from 7.7% 
in September 2010, but was in line with the end-year target of 8.0%. This outturn was largely 
on  account  of  the  rise  in  annual  food  inflation  to  4.4%  from  2.8%  in  September  2010,  as 
annual non-food Inflation decreased to 11.3% from 12.5% during the same period. 
Food inflation increased mainly on account of price increases on cereals, selected 
5.  
vegetable,  beef  products,  and  fish  due  to  seasonal  supply  factors.  However,  non-food 
inflation slowed down on account of the Kwacha exchange rate appreciation against the US 
dollar during the period under review. 
Money supply and domestic credit 
6.  
Preliminary estimates indicate that broad money (M3), comprehensively defined to 
include  foreign  currency  deposits,  increased  by  2.5%  (September  2010,  rose  by  7.9%)  to 
K18,477.0 billion in December 2010 from K18,018.4 billion in September 2010. This growth 
in M3 was below the quarterly projection of 3.2%. 
The outturn in M3 was largely due to an increase in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) by 
7.  
10.3%  reflecting  increased  lending  to  Government.  However,  Net  Foreign  Assets  (NFA) 
declined by 7.9% mainly on account of a 1.3% decrease in gross international reserves to 
US  $2,093.7  million  as  at  end-December  2010,  coupled  with  1.2%  appreciation  of  the 
Kwacha against the United States dollar. 
8.  
On an annual basis, M3 growth increased to 30.8% in December 2010 from 32.8% 
in September 2010. This outturn was due to the rise in NFA by 40.1% (September 2010, fell 
by 6.9%) primarily on account of an increase in gross international reserves. The NDA rose 
by a lower margin of 25.6% compared with the rise of 94.6% recorded in September 2010.

Domestic  credit,  comprehensively  defined  to  include  foreign  currency  loans, 
9.  
increased by 5.4% to K14,915.1 billion as at end-December 2010 (September 2010, growth 
of 3.1%) from K14,153.8 billion in September 2010. This outturn was mainly due to increased 
lending to the private sector (including public enterprises) and Central Government by 5.7% 
and  4.6%,  respectively.  On  an  annual  basis,  domestic  credit  growth  at  22.9%  was 
9.4 percentage points higher than the 13.5% recorded in September 2010.  
10.  
On a sectoral basis, households (personal loans category) continued to account for 
the  largest  share  of  outstanding  credit,  accounting  for  26.8%  [26.3%]1  in  December  2010. 
The  agricultural  sector  was  second  at  17.6%  [17.1%],  followed  by  manufacturing  12.7% 
[13.4%],  wholesale  and  retail  trade  10.8%  [12.0%],  real  estate  6.2%  [5.4%],  construction 
5.8%  [6.0%],  transport,  storage  and  communications  4.7%  [5.3%],  community,  social  and 
personal services 3.7% [2.5%] and mining and quarrying 3.2% [3.1%]. 
increased  by  5.6% 
The  stock  of  Government  securities  outstanding 
Interest rates 
Yield  rates  for  Government  securities  trended  upwards,  extending  gains  from  the 
11.  
previous  quarter  as  investors  sought  to  consolidate  positive  returns  over  the  inflation  rate. 
Thus, the composite weighted average Treasury bill yield rate increased by 58 basis points 
to 8.2% while that for Government bonds rose marginally by 10 basis points to 11.3%. 
12.  
to 
K9,940.9 billion at the end of the fourth quarter from K9,411.2 billion in the third quarter. This 
was mainly accounted for by an increase of 13% in the amount of Treasury bills outstanding 
against a modest growth of 0.2% recorded for Government bonds. Despite this, Government 
bonds  accounted  for  the  largest  proportion  of  the  outstanding  total  stock  of  marketable 
securities, contributing K5,439.4 billion (54.7%) to the entire portfolio. Total Treasury bills in 
circulation  amounted  to  K4,501.5  billion,  representing  45.3%  of  the  total  marketable 
securities outstanding.  
13.  
Investment in Treasury bills held by non-residents increased to K497.0 billion from 
K8.8  billion  in  the  third  quarter.  The  increase  reflected  renewed  confidence  in  short-term 
Government  paper.  Conversely,  foreign  Investment  in  Government  bonds  decreased  to 
K127.9  billion  from  K150.5  billion  recorded  in  the  third  quarter,  due  to  net  maturities. 
Collectively,  total  holdings  of  Government  securities  by  non-resident  was  K625.4  billion, 
representing 7% of total securities outstanding. 
Developments  in  commercial  banks’  nominal  interest  rates  continued  to  be  mixed 
14.  
during the reviewed quarter, with the weighted average lending base rate (WALBR) trending 
downwards  to  19.4%  from  19.8%  in  September  2010.  Similarly,  the  average  lending  rate 
(ALR) fell to 26.4% in December 2010 from 26.8% in September 2010. However, the 30-day 
deposit  rate  for  amounts  exceeding  K20  million  and  the  average  savings  rate  (ASR)  for 
amounts above K100,000 remained unchanged at 5.6% and 4.7%, respectively. 
Real sector 
15.  
Developments in the real sector were satisfactory during the reviewed quarter. This 
was  reflected  by  higher  output  of  most  monitored  commodities,  and  an  increase  in 
investment pledges.

Food reserve agency stocks 
16.  
The Food Reserve Agency (FRA) had 982,784 metric tonnes (mt) of maize in stock 
at  end-December  2010,  up  from  162,956  mt  at  end-September  2010,  out  of  which,  total 
purchases  from  the  marketing  season  amounted  to  883,036  mt.  The  Agency  also  had  in 
stock  4,508  mt  of  rice  (1,794  mt;  30th  September  2010),  out  of  which,  3,647  mt  was 
purchased during the 2010/11 agricultural marketing season. 
Major Millers maize stocks 
17.  
The  stock  of  maize  grain  held  by  major  millers  in  the  country  fell  by  10%  to 
91,655.9 mt  at  end-December  2010  from  101,807  mt  at  end-September  2010.  In  terms  of 
holdings by province, Lusaka contributed 52,250 mt (57%), Southern 18,007.5 mt (19.6%), 
Copperbelt  12,200  mt  (13.3%),  Central  7,128  mt  (7.8%),  Western  2,000  mt  (2.2%),  and 
Northern 40 mt (0.04%), respectively, while Eastern province accounted for 30 mt (0.03%). 
Mining 
18.  
During the fourth quarter of 2010, copper output fell by 13.5% to 197,500.2 mt from 
228,369.7  mt  produced  in  the  previous  quarter.  Nonetheless,  this  output  was  9.6%  higher 
than the 180,188.2 mt of copper produced in the fourth quarter of 2009. On an annual basis, 
copper output at 819,159.2 mt was 17.4% higher than the 697,700.7 mt of copper produced 
in 2009. 
19.  
Cobalt output rose by 1.5% to 2,401.79 mt during the fourth quarter of 2010 from 
2,367.26  mt  recorded in  the  previous  quarter.  This  level  of output  reflected  an increase  of 
26.7% when compared with the 1,896.24 mt produced in the fourth quarter of 2009. On an 
annual basis, cobalt output at 8,781.85 mt was 49.4% higher than the 5,879.14 mt of cobalt 
produced  in  2009.  The improvement  in  output was  due  to the  resumption  of  production  at 
Konkola Copper Mines and Chambishi Metals Plc. 
Manufacturing 
20.  
During the quarter under review, production of clear beer by Zambian Breweries Plc 
increased  by  6.2%  to  237,458  hectolitres  from  223,607  hectolitres  the  previous  quarter. 
Further,  this  output  was  46.7%  higher  than  the  160,820  hectolitres  produced  in  the 
corresponding  quarter  of  2009.  On  an  annual  basis,  output  of  clear  beer  at 
727,191.0 hectolitres  was  27.6%  higher  than  the  569,771.0  hectolitres  of  clear  beer 
produced in 2009. 
21.  
Similarly  output  of  soft  drinks  by  Zambian  Breweries  Plc  rose  by  28.8%  to 
163,848.0 hectolitres  from  127,244.0  hectolitres  in  the  previous  quarter.  Moreover,  this 
output level was 45.3% higher than 112,722.0 hectolitres produced in the fourth quarter of 
2009. On an annual basis, output of soft drinks at 561,910.0 hectolitres was 49.1% higher 
than the 376,747.0 hectolitres of soft drinks produced in 2009. 
22.  
Production of milk by Parmalat Zambia Ltd during the quarter under review rose by 
10%  to  8,613,737.0  litres  from  7,830,878.0  litres  in  the  third  quarter  of  2010.  Further,  this 
output was 5.3% higher than 8,178,335.0 litres of milk produced during the fourth quarter of 
2009.  On  an  annual  basis,  output  of  milk  at  32,456,505.0  litres  was  8.2%  higher  than  the 
29,984,030.0 litres of milk produced in 2009. 
23.  
Cement  output  increased  by  26.1%  to  359,966.0  mt  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2010 
from 312,791.0 mt during the previous quarter. This outturn was attributed to a rise in cement 
production at Lafarge Cement and Oriental Quarries by 14.9% and 2.3% to 251,505.0 mt and 
16,295 mt, respectively. Zambezi Portland Plc also increased its output of cement by 18.1% 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 3
to 92,166.0 mt. Total output of cement for the year at 1,126,728 mt was 37.9% higher than 
the 817,223.0 mt produced in 2009. 
Tourism 
24.  
During  the  quarter  under  review,  international  arrivals  at  the  country’s  four 
international airports2 declined to 116,140 passengers from 124,244 passengers in the third 
quarter of 2010. However, this was 24.0% higher than 93,688 passengers recorded during 
the fourth quarter of 2009. Livingstone and Mfuwe international airports, which are the major 
tourist  destinations,  accounted  for  20,590  passengers  and  257  passengers  compared  with 
21,272 passengers and 241 passengers in the previous quarter, respectively.  
On an annual basis, international arrivals at the country’s four international airports 
25.  
increased to 679,172 passengers from 438,788 passengers recorded in 2009, representing 
an increase of 20.27%. 
Investment 
26.  
Total investment pledges were estimated at US $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 
2010 compared with US $110.4 million in the third quarter. On a sectoral basis, pledges in 
manufacturing  were  US  $377.3  million,  real  estate  (US  $264.0  million),  agro-processing 
(US $252.4  million),  services  (US  $31.3  million),  agriculture  (US  $25.3  million),  tourism 
(US $16.7  million),  construction  (US  $11.8  million),  ICT  (US  $8.8  million),  and  mining 
(US $93.0 million). 
27.  
The pledges when fully executed are expected to generate 22,532 jobs (1,726 jobs: 
third  quarter  2010)  with  the  highest  contribution  from  services  at  12,763  jobs  followed  by 
agro-processing  at  5,860  jobs.  The  rest  were  manufacturing  (1,882  jobs),  construction 
(847 jobs), agriculture (397 jobs), tourism (343 jobs), real estate (247 jobs), ICT (157 jobs) 
and mining (14 jobs).

from US $2,008.4 million recorded in 2009. 
Investment pledges for the year 2010 increased by 138.6% to US $4,791.6 million 
Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)3 
Preliminary estimates indicate that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose by 7.1% in 
29.  
2010  from  6.4%  in  2009.  This  outturn  was  well  above  the target  of  5%  announced  by  the 
Minister of Finance and National Planning in his 2010 Budget Speech.

and mining sectors. 
 
The GDP outturn was largely attributed to the growth in the agricultural, construction 
The 2010 agricultural harvest was the highest recorded in history, having produced 
over  2.8  million  mt  of  maize;  while  the  mining  sector  also  benefitted  from  higher 
copper prices and production levels. 
The  growth  in  the  construction  sector  emanated  from  increased  residential, 
commercial  and  public  infrastructure  construction  projects  across  the  country  by 
both Government and the private sector.

Foreign exchange market 
31.  
The Kwacha was firm against major traded currencies, backed by consolidation of 
macroeconomic  gains  and  improved  liquidity  in  the  foreign  exchange  market.  A  sustained 
increase in the international price of copper to an average of US $9,127.4 per ton provided 
further support to the local currency. Thus, the Kwacha appreciated by 2.1% against the US 
dollar to an average of K4,731.52/US$ at the end of the fourth quarter.  
32.  
The Kwacha also appreciated by 2.4% against the pound sterling to an average of 
K7,375.98/£ and by 1.1% against the euro to an average of K6,277.82/€. These gains were 
partially  attributed  to  the  lingering  European  debt  crisis  despite  the  bailouts  extended  to 
Ireland  and  Greece.  In  contrast,  the  Kwacha  depreciated  by  2.0%  against  the  rand  to  an 
average  of  K691.22/ZAR.  The  South  African  currency  was  broadly  stronger  on  account  of 
higher price of gold and lower policy uncertainty after the Government clarified speculation 
on privatisation of public enterprises.  
33.  
In  terms  of  volume  of  transactions,  commercial  banks  made  spot  purchases  of 
US $1,417.2  million  from  the  non-bank  public  against  sales  of  US  $1,213.3  million.  This 
translated into net purchases of US $203.8 million in the fourth quarter. Commercial banks 
also  made  net  euro  and  pound  sterling  purchases  €9.2  million  ₤0.3  million,  respectively. 
However, banks recorded net sales of ZAR853.1 million in the fourth quarter, underpinning 
the continued demand for the South African rand. 
34.  
The  general  improvement  in  the  availability  of  foreign  exchange  necessitated  the 
Bank  of  Zambia’s  participation  in  the  market.  In  this  regard,  the  Bank  recorded  a  net 
purchase of US $58.5 million compared with net purchase or sale of US $67.5 million in the 
third quarter. 
During 
the  period  under  review, 
the  current  account  surplus  declined 
Balance of payments 
35.  
Preliminary data show that Zambia recorded an overall balance of payments (BoP) 
deficit  of  US  $71.1  million  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2010,  compared  to  the  surplus  of 
US $330.2  million  recorded  in  the  third  quarter  of  the  year.  This  was  largely  due  to  the 
unfavourable performance in both the current account balance and the capital and financial 
account.  
36.  
to 
US $390.6 million from US $399.1 million recorded the previous quarter, largely on account 
of a decline in the merchandise trade surplus and widening of the net income deficit. 
37.  
The merchandise trade surplus declined by 9.2% to US $771.4 million in the fourth 
quarter of 2010, from US $849.6 million recorded in the third quarter, following an increase in 
imports, which outweighed the rise in exports. Merchandise export earnings, rose by 5.2% to 
US $2,040.9 million from US $1,939.2 million recorded in the previous quarter. This was due 
to  an 
from 
US $1,610.2 million in the previous quarter. 
38.  
than 
US $1,534.9 million recorded during the third quarter of the year, reflecting an increase in the 
average  realised  price  by  6.8%  to  US  $7,380.92  per  tonne  from  US  $6,912.96  per  tonne 
recorded  in  the  third  quarter.  In  addition,  copper  export  volumes  increased  by  0.9%  to 
224,128.6 tonnes from 222,034.6 tonnes. 
39.  
However, cobalt export earnings declined by 1.4 % to US $74.2 million in the fourth 
quarter of 2010 from US $75.3 million in the previous quarter. This followed a slide in the 
average realised price by 3.9% to US $32,165.02 per tonne from US $ 33,467.08 per tonne 
in  the  preceding  quarter  despite  a  rise  in  export  volumes  by  2.6%  to  2,308.0  mt  from 
2,249.9 mt recorded in the third quarter. 
Copper  export  earnings,  at  US  $1,654.3  million,  were  7.8%  higher 
in  metal  exports  earnings  by  7.3% 
to  US  $1,728.5  million 
increase 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

Similarly, non-traditional exports (NTEs) f.o.b. fell by 5.1% to US $312.4 million from 
40.  
the  US  $329.0  million  realised  the  previous  quarter.  This  was  largely  due  to  declines  in 
export earnings from copper wire, cotton lint, electrical cables, fresh fruits and vegetables, 
petroleum products and electricity. 
41. 
 In  the  period  under  review,  merchandise  imports,  at  US  $1,308.4  million  were 
15.4% higher than US $1,134.3 million recorded the previous quarter. A surge in import bills 
associated with commodity groups, such as, food items, chemicals, iron and steel and item 
thereof and industrial boilers and equipment explained this outturn. 
42.  
During  the  same  period,  the  net  income  account  deficit  widened  by  3.2%  to 
US $381.3 million from US $369.3 million in the third quarter. This was largely on account of 
an  increase  in  income  on  equity  payments  and  interest  payments.  The  current  account 
transfers,  increased  to  US  $128.1  million  from  US  $93.6  million  recorded  the  previous 
quarter, explained by the disbursement of budget grants amounting to US $53.8 million.  
43.  
The  capital  and  financial  account  deficit  widened  to  US  $354.5  million  from 
US $238.9  million  recorded  in  the  third  quarter.  This  was  largely  due  to  the  unfavourable 
performance of the financial account arising from a surge in short-term deposits abroad by 
the private sector, despite the increase in foreign direct investment. 
Developments in the financial sector 
44.  
The overall financial condition of the banking sector for the quarter ended December 
2010 was satisfactory. On aggregate, the banking sector’s capital position, asset quality and 
liquidity were satisfactory. However, the earnings performance of the sector declined largely 
on  account  of  an  increase  in  the  non-interest  expenses  (due  to  increases  in  staff 
emoluments, reorganization costs and additional tax provisions).  
45.  
Overall  financial  condition  and  performance  of  the  Non-Bank  Financial  Institutions 
sector was rated fair during the quarter under review. The sector was adequately capitalised 
with “fair” asset quality, while earnings performance was rated “satisfactory”. 
46.  
As  part  of  the  overall  objective  to  enhance  financial  inclusion,  the  BoZ  undertook 
provincial sensitisation tours on savings and credit covering all the nine provinces of Zambia. 
The tours focused on the following topical areas:  
– 
The role and functions of the BoZ; 
– 
The need to deal with licensed financial institutions;  
– 
Getting credit; and  
– 
The operations of a credit reference bureau. 
47.  
The  BoZ  is  planning  to  conduct  the  tours  on  a  regular  basis  to  address  public 
misconceptions  about  the  role  of  the  BoZ  in  the  financial  sector.  Future  tours  will  also 
educate  the  public  on  how  to  detect  genuine  currency  and  how  to  invest  in  Government 
securities.  The  BoZ  was  requested  to  publish  the  names  of  licensed  financial  service 
providers in the print media on a more regular basis. 
Developments in banking, currency and payment systems 
48.  
During  the  quarter  under  review,  there  was  a  continued  improvement  in  the 
availability  of  electronic  payment  options.  The  number  of  Point  of  Sale  (POS)  terminals 
increased by 8.3% to 1,119 (third quarter 2010: 1,033). The volume of POS transactions also 
increased by 42.2% to 284,145 (third quarter 2010: 199,817). Similarly, the values of POS 
transactions  increased  by  32.6%  to  K113.9  billion  (third  quarter  2010:  K85.9  billion).  The

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
Bank would like to urge members of the public to use Point of Sale terminals as they provide 
a more convenient, safer, efficient and cost effective way of making payments. 
49.  
Further,  the  number  of  Automated  Teller  Machines  (ATMs)  increased  by  4.5%  to 
489 ATMs (third quarter 2010: 468). The volume of ATM transactions also increased by 5.1% 
to  6,654,992  (third  quarter  2010:  6,333,073).  Similarly,  the  value  increased  by  17.1%  to 
K3,397.3 billion (third quarter 2010: K2,897.6 billion). 
50.  
The  total  volume  of  cheques  returned  unpaid  on  account  of  insufficiently  funded 
accounts  increased  by  5.4%  to  4,428  (third  quarter  2010:  4,202)  cheques  while  the  value 
decreased by 8% to K36.2 billion (third quarter 2010: K35.3 billion). The Bank would like to 
urge  members  of  the  public  to  always  ensure  that  they  fund  their  accounts  sufficiently 
whenever they issue cheques. This will ensure that they do not face criminal charges under 
the  National  Payment  Systems  Act  for  bouncing  cheques  dishonestly  or  with  intent  to 
defraud. 
Economic programme 
51.  
A  follow-up  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  Mission  visited  the  country  from 
28th October to 3rd November 2010 to conclude discussions for the 5th Review under the 
Extended  Credit  Facility  (ECF)  arrangement.  The  mission  had  fruitful  discussions  with  the 
Zambian  authorities  and  reached  agreement  on  a  set  of  macroeconomic  policies  and 
structural measures for the remainder of 2010 and 2011.

The IMF Executive Board meeting was held on 10th December 2010 and completed 
the  fifth  review  of  Zambia’s  economic  programme.  This  resulted  in  the  immediate 
disbursement  of  an  amount  equivalent  to  SDR  18.395  million  (about  US  $28.3  million), 
bringing  total  disbursements  under  the  ECF  arrangement  to  SDR  201.7  million  (about 
US $310.3 million).

The IMF mission commended the authorities for Zambia’s economic prospects that 
have  continued  to  improve  as  well  as  for  having  sound  macroeconomic  policies.  It  also 
commended  the  authorities  for  the  progress  made  in  implementing  structural  reforms. 
However, the Fund noted that the main medium-term challenge remained that of creation of 
fiscal  space  for  priority  spending,  enhancement  of  economic  diversification  and  poverty 
reduction.

Total  disbursed  poverty  reduction  budget  support  (PRBS)  in  the  fourth  quarter  of 
2010 amounted to US $123.4 million from; the African Development Bank (US $49.8 million), 
European  Union 
(US  $9.9  million)  and  Germany 
(US $9.9 million). This brought the total disbursed PRBS to US $227.4 million for the year 
against the projection of US $222.9 million. The variance of about US $4.5 million is largely 
attributed to exchange rate variations. 
55.  
In addition, a total of US $35.0 million mining tax revenue was received from First 
Quantum Mining Plc, for the benefit of Government, while Bank of Zambia foreign exchange 
purchases  from  the  market  amounted  to  US  $61.0  million  during  the  period  under  review. 
The  above  receipts  were  against  payments  to  PTA  Bank  (US  $139.0  million)  for  oil 
procurement and debt service payments (US $44.5 million).

 Lagged effects of money supply growth in 2010: During the second half of 2010 
there was a rapid increase in broad money by over 15.0%, largely due to lending to 
government for the purpose of purchasing maize following the bumper harvest. 
57.  
However, the Bank of Zambia will continue to monitor developments and undertake 
appropriate monetary policy actions to ensure that monetary targets are achieved. To contain 
growth of money supply within the programmed path, Bank of Zambia will continue to employ 
open  market  operations  and  auctioning  of  Government  securities.  This  is  expected  to  be 
complemented by prudent fiscal operations.
