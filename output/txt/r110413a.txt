Introduction 
1. 
Global  capital  markets  are  engaged  in  a  footrace.  On  the  one  foot,  capital  markets  in 
emerging market countries are widening and deepening in order to improve domestic capital 
intermediation. On the other, international investors in developed countries are diversifying 
their portfolios in order to boost returns and spread risk. Both are typically seen as essential 
ingredients of global financial liberalisation and integration. Yet their implications for global 
financial stability are potentially quite different. The first determines the absorptive capacity of 
high-return, capital-recipient countries. The second defines the distributive capacity  of low-
return,  capital-providing  countries.  Any  imbalance  between  the  rate  at  which  international 
capital is distributed and absorbed may spillover to global capital markets. Reducing these 
spillovers may require a rethink of the rules of the international financial system.  
Experience  during  2010  provides  a  good  illustration.  Gross  portfolio  equity  inflows  to 
emerging  markets  surged  as  investors  substituted  out  of  low  growth  developed  markets 
(Chart 1). Gross equity inflows to certain emerging markets were large relative to domestic 
market capitalisation (Chart 2). The resulting indigestion problem caused bubbly behaviour in 
emerging asset markets. In response, a number of countries have thrown grit in the wheels 
of finance through macro-prudential measures or capital flow restrictions.  
These surges in foreign capital flows, and associated asset market spillovers, are far from 
new. Through this century, a new wave of inflows to emerging markets has been building. 
Although halted temporarily by the financial crisis, its effect has been to buoy emerging asset 
prices  (Chart  3).  Earlier  centuries  have  seen  many  similar  episodes  of  capital  flow  surges 
into  emerging  markets,  from  the  South  Sea  bubble  in  1720  to  the  East  Asian  crisis  of  the 
1990s (Reinhart and Rogoff (2008)).  
Historically, as these waves have broken they have often caused quite a splash, with sharp 
capital and asset price reversals (IMF (2011)). Some commentators have called those capital 
reversals  “sudden  stops”  (Dornbusch,  Goldfajn  and  Valdés  (1995)).  But  the  underlying 
problem  may  be  as  much  the  start  as  the  stop.  The  seeds  of  emerging  market  crises  are 
sown in the build-up phase, as inflows dwarf the absorptive capacity of recipient countries’ 
capital markets.  
Capturing  that  dynamic  requires  a  different  metaphor  –  the  “Big  Fish  Small  Pond”  (BFSP) 
problem. The Big Fish here are the large capital-exporting, advanced countries. The Small 
Ponds  are  the  relatively  modest  financial  markets  of  capital-importing  emerging  countries. 
Past experience suggests that as big fish enter the small pond, this can cause ripples right 
across  the  international  monetary  system,  never  more  so  than  in  today’s  financially  inter-
connected world.  
This paper considers the BFSP problem. It plots the evolution of the international financial 
network over the past quarter-century. And, within that, it assesses recent shifts in portfolio

choice  by  international  investors  which  may  have  accentuated  today’s  BFSP  problem 
(Section  2).  More  speculatively,  it  then  considers  potential  future  trends  in  portfolio  choice 
and assesses their implications for tomorrow’s BFSP problem (Section 3).  
If recent trends are continued, the BFSP problem may become more acute over time. In the 
race  between  capital  market  deepening  in  emerging  markets  and  capital  diversification  in 
advanced economies, the latter may gain the upper hand (or foot). The BFSP problem during 
2010 may have been the thin end of a sizable wedge. That, in turn, may intensify the debate 
on appropriate policy responses, such as the pace of capital liberalisation and the case for 
capital restrictions (Section 4).  
Today’s BFSP problem 
2. 
A  useful  panorama  on  financial  globalisation  is  provided  by  mapping  the  evolution  of  the 
global financial network over time. The topology of this network provides a simple, graphical 
visualisation of liberalisation patterns. In particular, network graphics can be used to visualise 
“node  size”  –  as  a  measure  of  the  capital-absorptive  capacity  of  emerging  markets  –  the 
Small  Pond;  and  “link  scale”  –  as  a  measure  of  the  capital  distribution  of  advanced 
economies – the Big Fish. 
As a first cut, we use a dataset developed at the Bank of England on stocks of cross-border 
capital,  spanning  18  advanced  and  emerging  economies  (Kubelec  and  Sa  (2010)).1  This 
enables  us  to  track  the  growth  in,  and  financial  linkages  between,  countries  over  time. 
Chart 4  plots  this  international  network  map  at  five-year  intervals  from  1980  to  2005.  The 
node  size  for  each  country  is  measured  as  the  absolute  sum  of  its  external  assets  and 
liabilities,  while  the  width  of  the  links  between  nodes  measures  bilateral  gross  external 
assets. Both are in (log) dollar terms.   
Taken over the past quarter-century as a whole, there is significant evidence of both capital 
market deepening (increased node size) and integration (increased link size). On average, 
total  stocks  of  external  assets  have  increased  seventeen-fold  over  this  period,  rising  from 
around  $1.5  trillion  in  1980  to  $26  trillion  by  2005.  Relative  to  these  countries’  GDP,  they 
have risen from 18% in 1980 to over 70% by 2005. This is consistent with a period of intense 
financial globalisation.  
Yet,  despite  this,  the  balance  of  global  financial  power  has  not  altered  markedly.  The 
financial core countries at the beginning of the period (such as the US and UK) remain core 
at  the  end;  the  offshore  financial  centres  (Hong  Kong  and  Singapore)  remain  significant 
throughout; while emerging markets remain, in the main, on the financial periphery.  
To illustrate that, the share of intra-advanced country external asset stocks in the global total 
was 77% in 1980. By 2005, that fraction had actually risen slightly to around 80%. Over the 
same period, the contribution of advanced to emerging market external asset stocks in the 
total fell from 13% to 5%, at the same time as the GDP share of emerging markets rose from 
13% to 16%. So despite rising significantly in absolute terms, financial globalisation has not 
obviously closed the gap between core and periphery. These aggregate patterns mask two 
important,  more  recent  trends.  The  first  is  the  well-documented  accumulation  of  official 
foreign exchange reserves by emerging market countries, in particular since 2005. The stock 
of global official reserves stood at $10 trillion by end-2010, having more than doubled since 
2005.  These  flows  are  in  some  respects  an  oddity  of  international  finance,  with  capital 
flowing “uphill” from emerging to advanced economies and with emerging market investors 
exhibiting a “foreign bias” for debt securities (Prasad, Rajan and Subramanian (2007)).

pattern of the international banking network.

At the same time, a less well-documented trend in private-sector portfolio allocation has been 
acting  in  the  exact  opposite  direction.  This  has  involved  capital  flowing  “downhill”  and  is 
associated with investors seeking instead to reduce “home bias” in their investment portfolio. 
To  see  it,  Chart  5  plots  the  global  network  map  focussing  on  a  subset  of  external  asset 
stocks, namely portfolio equity flows. The same pattern of intensifying global integration is 
evident.  Indeed,  the  intensification  is  altogether  more  dramatic:  total  holdings  of  external 
equity  have  risen  more  than  200-fold  over  the  past  quarter-century,  an  increase  of 
$4.6 trillion. 
But unlike for total external assets, the gap between core and periphery has been closing. 
The  relative  contribution  of  intra-advanced  country  external  portfolio  asset  stocks  fell  from 
around 99% to 84% between 1980 and 2005. Over the same period, the relative contribution 
of advanced to emerging market external portfolio asset stocks rose from virtually nothing to 
over 8%. That is a fairly dramatic shift in international investors’ portfolio choice. 
What explains it? One plausible candidate is increased portfolio diversification by institutional 
investors  in  advanced  countries.  It  is  well-known  that  international  investment  portfolios 
exhibit  an  acute  home  bias,  with  portfolio  shares  much  more  heavily  skewed  towards  the 
home  market  than  would  be  implied  by  conventional  asset  pricing  models  (French  and 
Poterba (1991), Forbes (2010)). There is a home-bias puzzle.  
To  illustrate,  Table  1  constructs  some  equity  home  bias  estimates  for  the  G20  countries 
between 1995 and 2007. Home bias is measured here as an index lying between zero and 
one.2 So a value of unity indicates complete home bias – that is, a country holds no foreign 
equity in its investment portfolio. A value of zero, meanwhile, suggests home bias has been 
completely  eliminated,  with  a  country  investing  in  proportion  to  the  world  market  portfolio. 
Intermediate values tell us the proportion a country is underweight foreign assets relative to a 
world portfolio benchmark.  
The following points are noteworthy: 
 
Equity home bias remains very significant across every country in the world. The un-
weighted average home bias across the G20 in 2007 was around 0.78. Weighted by 
market  capitalisation,  average  home  bias  was  0.66.  So,  in  weighted  terms,  G20 
countries’ holdings of foreign equity are around a third of the value they would be in 
the theoretically optimum market portfolio. 
This  home  bias  is  lower  among  advanced  than  emerging  market  economies.  The 
un-weighted  home  bias  index  in  2007  was  0.63  for  advanced  countries,  while  for 
emerging market G20 economies it was 0.90. For those emerging economies which 
maintain  capital  restrictions,  such  as  India  and  China,  home  bias  remains  almost 
complete. 
On  average,  there  has  been  a  decline  in  equity  home  bias  across  G20  countries 
over time. Among advanced G20 economies, the un-weighted home bias index has 
fallen from 0.75 in 1995 to 0.63 in 2007. Weighted by market capitalisation, it has 
fallen from 0.79 to 0.61 over the same period. Foreign equity holdings have gone 
from a fifth to a third of their theoretical benchmark. 
While seemingly modest in index terms, the implied portfolio reallocations amount to 
very  sizable  portfolio  equity  flows.  That  is  because  stocks  of  outstanding  equity 
assets are enormous. For example, a fall of 0.1 in the weighted home bias index for 
advanced  countries  in  2007  relative  to  2006  would  have  equated  to  a  portfolio 
reallocation  to  foreign  markets  of  around  $4.5  trillion.  That  is  a  big  fish.  To  give

  some  context,  the  market  capitalisation  of  all  G20  emerging  market  countries  in 
2007 was $6.8 trillion. That is a smallish pond.   
For individual countries, some of the falls in home bias have been fairly dramatic – 
for example, in Germany, France and Italy. Changes in US patterns of home bias 
are also very significant in financial terms. The fall of 0.17 in measured US home 
bias  between  1995  and  2007  corresponds  to  an  annual  average  portfolio 
reallocation to the rest of the world of around $370 billion (or 1.4% of non-US global 
GDP).  
The pace at which home bias has been reduced is all the more striking because, 
over the same period, emerging markets have become a larger slice of the global 
portfolio  pie.  Between  1995  and  2010,  the  emerging  G20  countries  more  than 
quadrupled  their  share  of  the  world  equity  market  portfolio,  from  4%  to  21% 
(Chart 6).  Had  advanced  country  portfolio  allocations  remained  constant  over  this 
period, measured home bias would have risen rather than fallen.  
These trends in international portfolio allocation have been a key driver behind the emerging 
BFSP  problem  during  the  course  of  this  century.  Portfolio  reallocation  by  the  big  fish  has 
outpaced growth in the small pond of emerging capital markets. The upshot has been large 
and mounting financial ripples. These strengthening waves of capital inflows have, in turn, 
prompted some emerging countries to construct protective policy seawalls, such as capital 
flow restrictions and macro-prudential policies. Recently, these measures have included: 
 
In  Hong  Kong,  the  authorities  imposed  a  cap  on  loan-to-value  (LTV)  ratios and  a 
maximum loan amount on certain properties, alongside an increase in stamp duty 
on sales in October 2009. 
The  Chinese  authorities  in  2010  increased  taxes  on  properties  resold  within  five 
years and offered greater administrative guidance on financing, including lower LTV 
ratios for second and third homes and a mandated increase in mortgage rates for 
second homes.  
In Brazil, the authorities reintroduced in October 2009 a tax on non-resident portfolio 
equity  and  debt  inflows,  with  a  broader  coverage  and  a  higher  rate.  They  also 
increased the tax on the margin payments required on foreign exchange futures and 
other  derivatives.  In  early  2011,  reserve  requirements  on  short  foreign  exchange 
positions were introduced.  
In  South  Korea,  four  sets  of  measures  have  been  introduced:  stronger  foreign 
currency  liquidity  standards  for  banks  (November  2009);  reduced  short-term 
external bank debt and limiting foreign currency bank loans (June 2010); a macro-
prudential  stability  levy,  planned  to  be  introduced  in  2011,  on  banks’  non-deposit 
foreign currency liabilities (late 2010); and the reintroduction of a withholding tax on 
foreign purchases of treasury bonds (January 2011). 
In Turkey, the central bank raised reserve requirements, and reduced policy rates, 
to address accelerating credit growth and financial stability. 
In Thailand, a withholding tax was imposed in October 2010 on non-resident interest 
earnings and capital gains on state bonds. 
In  Indonesia,  the  central  bank  introduced  in  June  2010  a  package  of  measures, 
including a one-month holding period requirement for central bank securities.

From a public policy perspective, one key question is whether the frequency and amplitude 
of  these  global  financial  ripples  will  rise  or  fall  in  the  period  ahead.  In  other  words,  will

tomorrow’s  BFSP  problem  be  greater  or  lesser  than  today’s?  To  answer  that,  we  need  to 
return  to  the  global  financial  footrace.  Judging  that  race  involves  balancing  two  powerful 
forces of financial liberalisation:  
 
 
Plotting  the  future  path  of  these  factors  is  far  from  straightforward.  But  some  quantitative 
thought-experiments can help clarify the balance of these forces. To keep these experiments 
as  transparent  as  possible,  consider  the  simplest  possible  one-factor  model  of  financial 
liberalisation. The one factor is the level of economic development of the G20 economies, as 
proxied by GDP per capita.  
Theoretically,  we  would  expect 
to  be  shaped  by  economic 
development. This is consistent with the economic growth literature emphasising the positive, 
two-way relationship between financial deepening and economic growth (Levine (2005)). The 
cross-section and time-series evidence presented here supports that hypothesis.  
To generate projections for the single factor – GDP per capita – we use a calibrated cross-
country  convergence  model,  in  the  spirit  of  Barro  and  Sala-i-Martin  (1992)  and  Mankiw, 
Romer and Weil (1992). These GDP per capita projections are then adjusted for expected 
future changes in population growth to give a set of cross-country projections for GDP from 
2010 to 2050. Chart 7 shows the global distribution of G20 GDP at decadal intervals over this 
period.  These  projections  are  necessarily  tentative,  but  are  broadly  in  line  with  external 
estimates.3 
Nominal  GDP  in  the  emerging  G20  exceeds  that  in  the  advanced  G20  by  2030.  The 
advanced economies’ share of G20 GDP halves between 2010 and 2050, from 70% to 36%, 
while the emerging G20 economies’ share rises from 30% to 64%.  Over the next 40 years, 
advanced and emerging countries will most likely swap GDP shares. By 2050, China’s share 
of G20 GDP is 22% and India’s 18%, with the US falling to 20%. In the thought-experiment, 
this shift in the balance of global activity has important implications for the balance of global 
capital flows. 
liberalisation 
The evolution of home bias 
(a) 
With  mixed  success,  theoretical  studies  have  sought  to  explain  cross-country  patterns  of 
home  bias  (Lewis  (1999)  and  Karolyi  and  Stulz  (2003)).  Perhaps  the  most  cogent 
explanations are grounded either in legal restrictions (including capital controls and lack of 
property  rights)  and  information  asymmetries  between  home  and  host  countries  (Gehrig 
(1993)). Globalisation is likely to have eroded both of these market frictions somewhat over 
the past decade, in particular among emerging markets. That is consistent with the evidence 
in Table 1.  
Predicting the future course of these (legal and information) factors is far from easy. But one 
plausible  instrument  for  financial  diversification  is  economic  development.  Cross-country 
evidence  suggests  so.  Chart  8  plots  a  cross-section  of  measured  equity  home  bias  in 
58 countries against levels of GDP per capita in those countries in 2005. The correlation is 
strong  and  significant:  GDP  per  capita  accounts  for  almost  60%  of  the  cross-sectional 
variation  in  home  bias.  As  a  ready-reckoner,  every  $10,000  per  capita  rise  in  GDP  is 
associated with a fall in home bias of around 0.1.4 
                                                 
3  For example, O’Neill (2011).  
4  This cross-sectional relationship was also used to counter-factually predict time-series patterns of home bias 
in a number of G20 countries.  GDP per capita was a reasonable predictor of historical movements in home 
bias, in particular among advanced economies.

Using economic development as an instrument for portfolio diversification, GDP per capita 
projections can be used to simulate the possible future course of home bias. Futurology of 
this kind of course comes with large caveats and confidence intervals. Given the simplicity of 
the model, it is a thought-experiment rather than a forecast. And underlying that experiment 
is  an  assumption  that  advanced  countries  continue  to  grow  and  diversify  their  equity 
portfolios, but at a slower rate than catch-up emerging market economies.  
Table 2 shows the evolution of equity home bias at decadal intervals out to 2050 for the G20 
in this thought-experiment. Some clear points emerge: 
 
All  G20  countries  see  a  reduction  in  home  bias.  The  un-weighted  G20  average 
home  bias  index  falls  by  0.33  between  2010  and  2050.  That  is  roughly  the  same 
rate of descent as over the past 10 years or so. 
Among a number of advanced countries, home bias has been significantly eroded 
by 2050, in some cases perhaps implausibly so. For example, in the US home bias 
falls from 0.51 to 0.09. 
Emerging market home bias remains in many cases significant even by the end of 
the period, reflecting their higher starting point. Average emerging market home bias 
in 2050 is not dissimilar to advanced country home bias in 2010. 
The implied reductions in home bias would have a potentially significant impact on 
the pattern of global capital flows. For example, if home bias in the G20 was to fall 
as  projected,  then  the  sum  of  gross  inflows  to  individual  emerging  markets  
– including flows from both advanced and other emerging markets – is on average 
$6.3 trillion per year over the period. 
   It would be easy to quibble with the detail of these projections. For example, cross-country 
information  frictions,  and  hence  home  bias,  may  never  be  fully  eliminated.  East  or  West, 
home  may  remain  best.  Nonetheless,  the  slow,  secular  fall  in  this  bias  does  not  appear 
implausible if recent portfolio patterns are a reliable guide to the future.  
The evolution of financial depth 
(b) 
Theory would predict a positive, two-way relationship between financial depth and economic 
development. Not only does greater development spur the deepening of capital markets to 
finance  investment  projects,  but  deeper  capital  markets  themselves  may  act  as  a  spur  for 
growth as they improve the efficiency of the financial intermediation process (Levine (2005)).  
Cross-country  evidence  again  supports  that  hypothesis.  Chart  9  plots  the  cross-sectional 
relationship between the log of GDP per capita and financial depth (measured as the ratio of 
equity market capitalisation to GDP). The correlation is positive and reasonably strong: GDP 
per  capita  accounts  for  almost  half  of  the  cross-sectional  variation  in  the  market 
capitalisation-to-GDP ratio. On average, a 10% rise in GDP per capita is associated with an 
increase in financial depth of around 1.5 percentage points.   
In principle, the relationship in Chart 9 could be used to simulate forward financial depth in 
the  G20  economies.  But,  unconstrained,  such  a  simulation  would  imply  a  potentially 
unbounded relationship between market capitalisation and a country’s GDP. Because market 
capitalisation  is  the  discounted  value  of  future  profit  streams  from  companies,  that  seems 
implausible.  
Charts 10 plots equity financial depth for the US and UK since 1929 and 1965 respectively. 
Between 1929 and 1990, the financial depth ratio in the US was roughly flat, at around 50%. 
As  the  US  liberalised  this  ratio  shifted  upwards,  averaging  around  100%;  it  has  remained 
roughly at these levels since. The UK has followed a similar pattern. To reflect these findings, 
in the simulations an (arbitrary) cap of 100% is placed on countries’ market capitalisation to 
GDP ratio, once they have reached current levels of US GDP per capita.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
Using the relationship in Chart 9 and the GDP projections, equity financial depth in the G20 
countries  can  be  projected  forward.  Many  of  the  advanced  countries  have  only  a  short 
distance to travel to reach 100%, given their starting point. Among the emerging G20, the 
average  financial  depth  ratio  rises  from  around  50%  in  2010  to  around  100%  by  2050 
(Chart 11). In other words, the pace of financial deepening in the emerging G20 countries is 
rather gradual. If anything, this may understate the likely pace of change. 
Nonetheless, these trends imply a rather striking shift in the composition of the global market 
portfolio.  Chart  12  shows  how  this  evolves,  measured  at  10-year  intervals.5  Some  notable 
points are: 
 
The share of G20 emerging markets in global equity market capitalisation rises from 
21% in 2010 to 56% by 2050. Over the same period, the contribution of advanced 
G20 economies falls from 66% to 31%.  
Within  this,  China’s  share  of  the  market  portfolio  almost  triples  to  around  20%  in 
2050.  India’s  share  rises  five-fold  to  15%.  Together,  these  two  countries’  market 
capitalisation is larger in 2050 than in all G20 advanced economies combined. 
In money terms, the stock market capitalisation of the G20 emerging markets rises 
to  around  $300  trillion  in  2050,  while  the  G20  advanced  economies  amount  to 
$170 trillion.  The  global  market  portfolio  pie  increases  fourteen-fold  between  2010 
and 2050. 
  The BFSP problem and public policy 
4. 
Having projected paths for home bias and market capitalisation among the G20 countries, 
the two can now be combined to give an illustrative general equilibrium projection of global 
flows  of  funds.  This  general  equilibrium  is  a  relatively  complex  one,  for  it  involves  the 
intersection of three forces in global finance: 
 
First,  the  tendency  towards  increased  diversification  among  advanced  country 
investors.  This  causes  more  water  to  flow  downhill  –  a  capital  flow  substitution 
effect; 
Second, the same trend among emerging economies but from a higher base. This 
would tend to push water uphill – a countervailing capital flow substitution effect; and 
Third,  a  change  in  the  composition  of  the  global  market  portfolio  as  emerging 
economies account for a larger slice of the pie – a capital flow income effect. 
  By combining these three factors, we can form a proximate picture of the emerging pattern of 
global  capital  flows.  These  projections  are  based  on  the  same  restrictive  set  of  modelling 
assumptions.  Nonetheless,  they  provide  a  transparent  window  on  possible  emerging 
patterns.  Are  the  forces  of  financial  deepening  in  emerging  capital  markets  sufficient  to 
outpace  the  reduction  in  advanced  country  portfolio  home  bias,  lessening  the  BFSP 
problem?  Or  does  portfolio  reallocation  by  advanced  economies  risk  swamping  embryonic 
emerging capital markets exacerbating this problem? 
Chart 13 looks at the ratio of annual average capital flows to G20 emerging markets relative 
to  their  market  capitalisation  over  the  period  2010  to  2050.  It  is  the  analogue  of  Chart  2, 
using projections of both numerator and denominator. The highest and lowest annual inflows 
over  the  projection  period  are  also  shown  to  capture  potential  annual  variation  in  capital 
flows. Chart 14 plots annual gross capital inflows to emerging markets over the same period.

Some notable points include:  
 
Over the period 2010 to 2050, the average scale of capital inflows, relative to market 
capitalisation, for the G20 emerging markets is around 8% per year. That is greater 
than the peak inflow experienced in the recent past, including in 2010, during which 
time asset prices rose significantly and protective policy measures were put in place.  
Given  the  likely  variation  in  these  inflows  year  by  year,  the  picture  is  even  more 
striking.  Potential  “peak”  inflows  are  into  double  digits  for  the  majority  of  G20 
emerging markets. As context, peak portfolio equity inflows to East Asian countries 
in the three years preceding their 1990s crisis averaged 4% of market capitalisation. 
For  some  individual  emerging  market  countries,  these  capital  inflow  patterns  are 
dramatic.  For  example,  over  the  period  2010–2050,  average  inflows  to  India  and 
Indonesia exceed 10% of their equity market capitalisation.  
Taken together, these projections do not suggest a dissipation of the BFSP problem. More 
likely,  they  suggest  it  could  intensify,  perhaps  significantly,  in  the  period  ahead.  If  capital 
markets operated efficiently, these portfolio flows need not cause waves in emerging credit 
and asset markets. In practice, frictions in the functioning of these markets mean that asset 
market spillovers seem very likely to persist. In other words, the splashes from the big fish 
risk causing waves every bit as great, and potentially greater, than those seen recently. 
On  this  run  of  history,  the  global  flow  of  funds  could  become  an  increasingly  powerful 
generator  of  global  financial  instabilities.  In  that  event,  pressures  could  mount  on 
policymakers  to  protect  against  the  rising  tide  of  capital  flow-induced  instability,  including 
through capital restrictions and macro-prudential measures. Some of these measures, if not 
unthinkable,  would  have  been  frowned  on  as  recently  as  a  decade  ago.  When  Malaysia 
imposed  restrictions  on  capital  movements  in  1998,  it  was  castigated  by  the  international 
community.  And  when  the  Hong  Kong  authorities  intervened  in  their  stock  market  in  the 
same year, many international policymakers blew a raspberry. 
What  a  difference  a  decade  makes.  What  a  difference  a  crisis  in  advanced  economies 
makes. Ideological aversion to throwing grit in the wheels of international finance appears, if 
not to have disappeared, then to have moderated. Where once it was raspberries, today’s 
policymakers  are  blowing  kisses.  Capital  restrictions  and  macro-prudential  policies  have 
entered the policy bloodstream, if not yet the mainstream. The debate today is how best to 
integrate such tools into established macroeconomic policy frameworks.  
The issues here are thorny ones. They include: 
 
Should  capital  restrictions  be  used  by  emerging  markets  as  a  last  resort  once 
conventional macroeconomic policies have been exhausted? Or should they instead 
play  a  supporting  role  in  all  seasons,  to  avert  excessive  capital  surges  and 
accompanying fluctuations in financial activity? And what guidelines, if any, should 
apply to the policies of advanced countries as the source of such capital surges?  
Are  capital  flow  restrictions  better  conceived  as  a  temporary  or  permanent 
measure?  On  the  one  hand,  temporary  measures  might better  reflect  the  need  to 
respond with exceptional measures only in exceptional circumstances. On the other, 
nesting  capital  restrictions  within  a  pre-agreed  framework  could  improve  the 
credibility and predictability of these measures among international investors. 
Should differing rules of the game apply to different sources of capital inflow (foreign 
direct investment versus portfolio flows versus banking flows)? And should different 
rules apply to flows of different maturity (short versus long–term)? Different sources 
and types of capital are believed to behave very differently during capital upswings 
and  downturns  (IMF  (2011)).  It  would  be  odd  for  public  policy  to  ignore  those 
behavioural differences.

   What are the respective roles of capital restrictions and macro-prudential policy? At 
present,  the  two  are  viewed  rather  differently,  with  views  on  capital  restrictions 
mixed,  while  macro-prudential  policies  are  increasingly  the  consensus.  Yet  these 
two sets of tool may differ more in detail than in principle. Macro-prudential policies 
may  also  have  a  role  to  play  in  moderating  credit  growth  in  the  source  of  capital 
surges – the advanced economies. 
What are the respective roles of capital restrictions and financial market deepening 
as responses to the BFSP problem? One policy option for emerging economies is to 
strengthen  and  deepen  their  domestic  capital  market  infrastructure,  so  that  it  is 
better able to absorb and intermediate incoming foreign capital. A reduction in those 
capital market frictions would tend to lower the asset market spillover costs of the 
BFSP problem. 
Finally,  what  guideposts  should  be  provided  by  the  international  community  in 
tackling the BFSP problem? The IMF recently began to explore such a framework 
(IMF (2011)). This raises a set of key questions about global financial governance. 
Are global financial network externalities sufficiently large to justify the international 
community  imposing  rules  of  the  financial  road?  And  how  much  driver  discretion 
should  instead  be  left  to  nation  states  which  ultimately  may  bear  the  costs  of  the 
BFSP problem?  
These are big public policy questions. They are by no means new ones. If the quantitative 
experiments  presented  here  are  even  roughly  right,  these  questions  may  assume  a  new 
urgency in the period ahead. The BFSP problem is real. It may be rising. The result would be 
growing  waves  of  global  financial  exuberance,  punctuated  by  crashing  capital  busts.  This 
roller-coaster has the potential to leave some nation states feeling queasy. They may even 
wish to get off. What is at stake may be more than just the future stability of the international 
financial system.
