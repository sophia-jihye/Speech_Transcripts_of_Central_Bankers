Internationalisation of Islamic finance and its role in strengthening financial and 
economic linkages 
Two important global trends are currently taking place. The first is the significant growth of 
emerging economies in the world, and the second is, the greater international integration as 
economies and financial systems become increasingly more connected. However, no longer 
is international trade solely between the emerging world and the developed world, but trade 
amongst the emerging world has increased immensely.  
While  world  trade  has  expanded  by  almost  four-fold,  trade  amongst  emerging  economies 
grew by more than ten times. In particular trade between Asia and the Middle East and Latin 
America is gaining traction and importance.  
Similarly,  cross-border  financial  flows  are  no  longer  concentrating  between  the  emerging 
world  and  the  developed  markets,  but  increasingly  it  is  between  emerging  economies.  As 
financial  markets  and  financial  systems  in  emerging  economies  become  more  developed, 
greater  financial  flows  between  our  economies  are  taking  place.  These  trends  have 
supported  and  reinforced  the  recovery  and  growth  that  is  currently  experienced  in  the 
emerging world.  
The  turn  of  this  millennium  has  seen  an  acceleration  in  the  internationalisation  of  Islamic 
finance. This is manifested by the increased number of Islamic financial institutions that are 
now operating beyond their own jurisdictions, and the increased international participation in 
Islamic financial markets. This trend is resulting in increased Shariah-compliant cross-border 
financial  flows.  With  its  internationalisation,  Islamic  finance  is  therefore  increasingly

contributing  to  the  more  efficient  mobilisation  and  allocation  of  funds  across  regions,  and 
strengthening  the  financial  and  economic  linkages  in  particular  in  between  our  emerging 
nations.  
In  this  regard,  the  transition  of  Islamic  finance  into  the  mainstream  of  the  global  financial 
system is an opportunity for the Nusantara financial intermediaries, in particular in Indonesia 
and Malaysia, to open new frontiers and to participate in this trend and thereby strengthen 
further  our  economic  and  financial  linkages.  With  our  own  respective  comparative 
advantages, we can leverage on the complementarities between our respective economies 
that  will  bring  forth  synergistic  effects  which  will  in  turn  contribute  towards  expanding  the 
markets,  widen  the  spectrum  of  products  and  services,  and  enhance  financial  markets 
activities. 
The Islamic Finance Agenda: enhancing linkage between Malaysia and Indonesia 
The  linkages  and  relationships  have  been  fostered  in  Islamic  finance  by  several  key 
developments.  By  the  private  sector,  it  has  been  in  terms  of  enhanced  presence  and 
participation in each othersâ€™ respective financial institutions, and by practitioners, it has 
been  in  terms  of  practising  in  each  others  financial  markets,  intermediaries,  and  learning 
institutions.  For  policy  makers  and  regulators,  it  has  been  in  joint  initiatives  to  create  the 
enabling  environment  for  effective  and  efficient  cross-border  financial  business.  There  has 
been  a  greater  sharing  of  technical  expertise  and  experiences  on  financial  markets  and 
infrastructure development including the harmonisation of regulatory arrangements. 
The  development  of  robust  financial  markets  and  enabling  environment  for  enhanced 
linkages between our markets are essential platforms to supporting our financial institutions 
and  intermediaries  for  more  effective  business  connections.  The  creation  of  counterparty 
banking lines between Islamic financial institutions in both countries and the development of 
efficient Islamic interbank money markets will aid this development.  
In particular, the potential for robust liquidity management would serve as a catalyst to fully 
capitalise  on  the  tremendous  opportunities  in  the  sukuk  market  in  enhancing  cross-border 
financial linkages. The opportunities offered in this dynamic and vibrant sukuk market in both 
our financial systems are further widened by the fact that the South East Asian region and 
that of the North Asia and the Middle East countries continue to have high surplus savings 
that  are  in  search  of  opportunities  for  investment  and  new  asset-classes  for  greater  risk 
diversification and improved returns for their investments.  
In  addition,  the  participation  in  key  international  infrastructures  such  as  the  International 
Islamic Liquidity Management Corporation (IILM) which will provide Shariah-compliant liquid 
instruments  would  also  facilitate  in  providing  an  environment  that  is  conducive  for  market 
players  to  grow.  This  would  address  the  challenge  of  building  bridges  between  the 
fragmented pools of liquidity in many countries, as well as address the cross-border liquidity 
requirements. The effective business linkages between the market players would in turn lead 
to cross-pollination of talents and resources, giving rise to innovative products and services, 
hence creating depth and breadth to the respective national financial markets.  
Another factor promoting enhanced cross-border flows relates to the issue of recognising 
Shariah  interpretations  in  the  offerings  of  cross-border  products.  The  current  efforts 
have already resulted in greater harmonisation amongst jurisdictions on the specific Shariah 
practices  relating  to  Islamic  finance.  In  our  pursuit  to  promote  understanding,  greater 
engagements and intellectual discourse among the Shariah scholars in the region have been 
fostered through regional Shariah Dialogues. These dialogues have been highly constructive. 
In this Conference, the deliberations on Shariah during the Specialised Workshops and the 
engagements  between  Shariah  advisors,  would  continue  this  process  to  enhance  greater 
appreciation and understanding of our respective Shariah practices.

The development of human capital in Islamic finance is another key thrust in our efforts to 
develop  capacity  in  supporting  cross-border  Islamic  finance  business.  The  collaboration 
between Malaysia and Indonesia in promoting partnerships in Islamic finance education are 
already taking place to expand the pool of talent and technical expertise in Islamic finance. 
Strategic  partnerships  between  the  International  Centre  for  Education  in  Islamic  Finance 
(INCEIF)  and  7  Indonesian  universities  have  allowed  for  the  exchange  of  academic 
resources  for  the  offering  of  specialised  programmes  in  Islamic  finance.  These  cross-
fertilisation  efforts  are  encouraging  future  collaboration  between  specialised  training 
institutions from both countries which would certainly enrich the Islamic finance industry. 
Indonesia,  kewangan 
Conclusion 
Izinkan saya untuk mengakhiri ucapan saya. Kewangan Islam kini telah berkembang pesat di 
serata  dunia  dan  menjadi  komponen  yang  semakin  penting  dalam  sistem  kewangan 
antarabangsa dan merupakan pengantaraan penting bagi transaksi rentas sempadan. Bagi 
Malaysia  dan 
Islam  menyediakan  peluang  strategik  untuk 
meningkatkan perkongsian bagi memperkembangkan lagi kewangan Islam dan seterusnya 
merangsang potensi pertumbuhan kita bersama. 
Berdasarkan  hubungan  yang  kukuh  antara  Malaysia  dan  Indonesia,  kerjasama  dalam 
kewangan Islam juga mempunyai potensi untuk memacu integrasi ekonomi dan kewangan 
masing-masing  dengan  negara-negara  membangun  yang  lain.  Kewangan  Islam  akan 
menggalakkan  jalinan  padu  untuk  mengukuhkan  lagi  kepentingan  bersama  bagi  mencapai 
kemajuan, kesejahteraan dan kemakmuran yang diingini.  
Let us take this opportunity to share the many possibilities that are before us.  
Sekian, terima kasih.
