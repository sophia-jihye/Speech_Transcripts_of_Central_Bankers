Andrew G Haldane: Risk off 
Paper  by  Mr  Andrew  G  Haldane,  Executive  Director,  Financial  Stability,  of  the  Bank  of 
England, 18 August 2011. 
 The views are not necessarily those of the Bank of England or the Financial Policy Committee. I would like to 
thank  Aashish  Pattani,  Ben  Broadbent,  Srishti  Chhabra,  David  Gregory,  Priya  Kothari,  James  McBride,  Lewis 
Webber and Nicola Worrow for comments and contributions. 
Four  years  on  from  the  start  of  the  Great  Recession,  the  world  economy  is  cloaked  in 
uncertainty.  The  story  so  far  is  well  understood.  Over-extension  of  private  sector  balance 
sheets  –  in  particular  among  banks  –  sowed  the  seeds  of  the  crisis.  Those  private  sector 
risks  have  since  been  socialised,  either  directly  through  support  for  the  financial  sector  or 
indirectly through lower aggregate output in the economy at large.  
That  socialisation  has  caused  balance  sheet  risk  to  migrate  from  the  private  to  the  public 
sectors. Today, these public sector balance sheets strains are most visible in Europe where 
a number of countries remain under the sovereign searchlight. But outside Europe, two of the 
world’s three largest economies – the United States and Japan – have been the subject of 
ratings  action.  And  sovereign  CDS  spreads  among  advanced  countries  are  at  their 
highest-ever levels. 
Four years on from the start of the Great Depression, the world economy was also cloaked in 
uncertainty.  In  his  inaugural  address  in  1933,  newly-elected  President  Roosevelt  famously 
captured the mood of the moment: “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself”. That fear 
factor is once again pervasive today. But do we have nothing to fear? And what role might 
policy – in particular macro-prudential policy – play in allaying those fears?  
Emerging from the Great Recession 
The path out of recession is invariably a bumpy one. This time’s Great Recession is unlikely 
to be an exception. Chart 1 compares the recent path of UK GDP with that following previous 
GDP dips: the Great Depression of the 1930s and the UK recession of the early 1990s. To 
date, GDP has steered a middle path, somewhat stronger than in the 1930s but weaker than 
in the early 1990s recovery. 
If past recessionary experience is any guide, the UK’s GDP trajectory might be expected to 
pick up pace from here. Most external forecasts remain broadly consistent with that view. But 
the  risks  around  this  path  are  considerable,  as  recent  indicators  of  slowing  global  activity 
attest. This is not altogether surprising. Crisis-induced recessions are deeper and longer, on 
average taking up to three years to return to their pre-crisis peak (Chart 2).  
Some take longer still. Following the Great Depression, UK GDP only recovered its pre-crisis 
level  after  5  years.  The  US  recovered  its  pre-crisis  level  after  7  years  (Chart  3).  Having 
reached this point, the US economy then lurched downwards again in 1937; it double-dipped. 
Roosevelt had been wrong in 1933. With hindsight, there had been plenty to fear.  
As in 1933, the fear factor is rife in today’s financial markets. The prompt has been sovereign 
debt concerns in parts of Europe and the United States. This is but the latest – and most 
severe – in a series of waves in sentiment since the onset of the crisis. Risk appetite has 
yo-yoed. In the language of the market, it has alternated between periods of “risk on” and 
“risk off”. Having been indecisive, financial markets are now not so sure.  
That is reflected in surveyed measures of market participants’ risk appetite (Chart 4). These 
were  at  above-average  levels  between  2005  and  2007  at  the  height  of  the  boom.  During 
2008, risk appetite dramatically tailed-off. At its low-point in early 2009, it was more than two

standard  deviations  below  normal.  Since  then  it  has  ebbed  (risk  off)  and  flowed  (risk  on). 
Today, it is around one standard deviation below normal and falling. Risk is “off”.  
Market metrics corroborate this story of acute risk aversion. The demand for safe assets has 
risen  significantly.  At  a  10-year  maturity,  US  government  benchmark  bond  yields  are  at 
around  their  lowest  levels  in  over  two  centuries  (Chart  5)  –  despite  the  recent  scare  over 
US debt  ceilings  and  subsequent  downgrade.  Long-term  UK  bond  yields  are  also  close  to 
historic lows, as are investment grade corporate bond yields. 
The price of gold has risen even more dramatically. Real gold prices have more than doubled 
since 2008, edging towards their previous high-water mark after the oil price shocks of the 
late  1970s  (Chart  6).  Safe-haven  flows  to  the  Swiss  franc  have  boosted  its  value  by  over 
30%  against  both  the  euro  and  the  dollar  since  September  2008.  The  reach-for-return, 
familiar at times in the past, has flipped into a scramble-for-safety. 
Risky assets tell a similar tale. The compensation investors demand for risk – the so-called 
risk  premium  –  in  advanced  economy  equities  and  investment  grade  corporate  bonds  is 
above  or  in  line  with  its  long-term  average  value.  Bank  lending  spreads,  which  embody  a 
compensation  for  risk,  are  materially  higher  for  all  classes  of  borrower.  And  measures  of 
equity market uncertainty, such as the VIX, are at levels not seen since early 2009 (Chart 7). 
Not for nothing has the VIX become known as the “fear index”.  
Some risky assets have fared better. Since their trough in late 2008, global high yield debt 
prices  have  risen  by  two-thirds,  emerging  markets  equities  have  roughly  doubled,  while 
commodity prices have risen by even more. But even these assets have recently fallen from 
their peaks. Investors have concluded this is not a time for bravery. For much of this century, 
risk was cheap. Today it is expensive. 
Market  participants’  willingness  to  put  risk  capital  to  work  can  be  seen  in  measures  of 
financial market liquidity. Those have also yo-yoed (Chart 8). Excess liquidity during the first 
half of the century gave way to plummeting liquidity during the depths of the crisis. Today, 
despite rock-bottom global interest rates, market liquidity remains below normal levels. Risk 
capital is parked on the sidelines. 
Balance sheet repair  
So  what  explains  this  continuing  aversion  to  risk?  Two  factors  are  central:  balance  sheet 
disrepair and psychological scarring. In other words, both balance sheet fundamentals and 
market  perceptions,  perhaps  detached  from  fundamentals,  appear  to  be  weighing  on 
risk-taking. 
Since  the  start  of  the  crisis,  balance  sheets  have  been  a  good  news/bad  news  story.  The 
good news is that balance sheet repair is underway in many sectors and countries. The bad 
news  is  that  this  process  appears  to  be  far  from  complete,  providing  a  continuing  strong 
headwind  to  risk-taking.  Consider  in  turn  the  balance  sheets  of  banks,  households, 
companies and governments.  
Pre-crisis, banks’ balance sheets were furthest out of kilter. Average leverage in the global 
banking  system  –  the  ratio  of  banks’  assets  to  their  equity  –  rose  to  highs  of  over 
40 (Chart 9). At the height of the boom, every $1 of bank assets was financed with $98 cents 
of debt. The global banking system was financing itself with a 98% loan-to-value mortgage.  
Since  then,  global  banks  have  raised  their  equity  by  around  $500  billion  and  shrunk  their 
assets by $3 trillion. As a result, global banks’ leverage has halved to around 20, close to its 
long-run  average.  Today,  every  $1  of  bank  assets  is  financed  with  $95  cents  of  debt  –  a 
more modest, though still racy, 95% loan-to-value mortgage. Banks’ liquid assets have risen 
even more dramatically. UK and US banks’ cash ratios are at their highest levels for several 
decades.

But this balance sheet adjustment appears to be far from complete. Banks are midstream in 
their  adjustment  to  new  regulatory  standards  and,  in  some  cases,  new  business  models. 
That  is  reflected  in  expectations  of  banks’  future  profitability.  These  remain  weak.  Recent 
results for the major global banks delivered returns to equity well below target and closer to 
average levels from the previous century of around 10%.  
Weak  profit  prospects  are  mirrored  in  equity  prices.  Today,  the  average  market  price  of 
global banks’ equity is slightly below its book value, having traded at a significant premium 
for  much  of  the  past  20  years  (Chart  10).  Around  three-quarters  of  the  world’s  20  largest 
global  banks  have  price-to-book  ratios  below  one.  Equity  prices  for  these  banks  are,  on 
average, back to levels last seen in 1998. For long-term holders of global bank equity, this 
has been a lost decade (and a bit). 
As equity prices have fallen, market-based measures of bank leverage – the ratio of bank 
assets to the market value of their equity – have risen. During the crisis, such market-based 
measures of leverage did a much better job of identifying problem banks than conventional 
risk-weighted  capital  ratios.1  So  measured,  the  world’s  largest  20  banks  are  at  present 
around 36 times levered. That is a loan-to-value mortgage of around 97%. 
The  household  sector,  too,  has  been  repairing  its  balance  sheet.  On  average  across  the 
US, UK and euro-area, households are running a financial surplus of around 2.5% of GDP 
(Chart 11). As recently as 2006, they were running a financial deficit of 1% of GDP. Since 
2007,  around  £100bn  has  been  repaid  each  year  by  UK  households.  Deleveraging  is 
underway.  
Yet this aggregate picture masks some important distributional differences. There remains a 
sizable tail of over-indebted households vulnerable to a worsening of financial conditions. In 
the UK, the proportion of households in negative equity is 1 in 14. In the US, it is 1 in 4. With 
house prices falling in both countries, that fraction may rise further. 
The  tail  of  “vulnerable”  households  (those  with  limited  or  no  equity  in  their  property  and 
reporting problems servicing their debt) is high and rising. So defined, vulnerable households 
in  the  UK  account  for  15%  of  household  secured  debt  and  35%  of  unsecured  debt 
(Chart 12).  These  shares  have  risen  over  the  past  three  years,  by  around  5  and 
10 percentage points respectively, despite interest rates being at rock-bottom. 
The  picture  in  the  corporate  sector  is,  in  some  respects,  not  dissimilar.  Companies  in  the 
main  advanced  countries  are  running  significant  financial surpluses,  on  average  of  around 
2.5%  of  GDP  (Chart  13).  Pre-crisis,  companies  were  running  financial  deficits  of  around 
1% of  GDP.  The  cash  position  of  the  corporate  sector  is  even  more  striking,  with  large 
UK corporates’ stock of cash up by over 40% since 2006.  
But as among households, this picture of aggregate health conceals a long tail. A number of 
companies appear to be struggling to meet interest payments even at ultra-low interest rates. 
The fraction of companies whose profits do not cover interest payments has actually risen 
slightly since the crisis; it is currently around one third (Chart 14). Within some sectors, such 
as property, debt-servicing capacity has deteriorated sharply.  
Despite these balance sheet headwinds, the macroeconomic situation today is far better than 
at  the  time  of  the  Great  Depression  –  with  one  exception.  The  exception  is  government 
finances.  Despite  the  much  smaller  fall  in  GDP,  UK  government  debt-to-GDP  ratios  have 
deteriorated  more  than  in  the  1930s  (Chart  15).  This  pattern  is  mirrored  across  advanced 
economies.  The  IMF  expect  debt-to-GDP  ratios  in  the  G7  economies  this  year  to  breach 
100% of GDP for the first time since the Second World War (Chart 16).  
                                                 
1  Perhaps  because  banks’  asset  measurement  is  not  distorted  by  errors  in  risk  weights  and  equity 
measurement is forward-looking and not distorted by different capital definitions – see Haldane (2011).

There is no magic number for debt ratios. But the historical record is revealing. Historically, 
ratios  in  excess  of  90–100%  of  GDP  have  been  found  to  exert  a  lasting  drag  on  growth, 
perhaps  of  around  1  percentage  point.2  At  these  levels,  government  debt  has  in  the  past 
been  growth-sapping  –  and  fear-enhancing.  That  adds  to  pressures on  debt  sustainability, 
which depends importantly on the wedge between interest costs and GDP growth. 
Psychological scarring  
These  balance  sheet  scars  are  real.  But  in  financial  markets,  risk  perceptions  are  as 
important as reality. Behavioural economics tells us that financial crashes can leave lasting 
psychological scars on risk-taking. These mean that perceptions of risk can be systematically 
over-stated – the fear of fear itself. 
One  potent  psychological  factor  is  disaster  myopia.  Psychologists  know  from  experimental 
evidence that, faced with uncertainty, people base their judgements on simple rules of thumb 
or heuristics.3 One such rule of thumb is the “availability heuristic”. This states that agents 
base  probabilistic  assessments  on  the  ease  with  which  an  event  can  be  brought  to  mind: 
how recently it has occurred, how severe are its effects and how personal is the experience. 
Car  crashes  are  the  classic  example.  These  often  arise  from  disaster  myopia,  as  drivers 
systematically under-estimate the probability of a pile-up and drive too fast. The longer the 
period  since  the  last  crash,  the  greater  the  risk-taking.  After  a  lengthy  stretch  of  clear 
motorway,  risk  appetite  may  become  too  healthy,  and  risk-taking  too  great,  relative  to  the 
true probability of disaster. In other words, drivers are disaster-myopic.  
Should a crash occur, however, risk-taking incentives go into reverse gear. Their closeness 
to  a  disaster  event  causes  drivers  to  move  more  slowly  than  might  be  justified  by  the 
underlying  risk.  The  experience  heuristic  leads  to  an  over-weighting  of  recent,  severe, 
personal events. Risk appetite then switches from too high to too low relative to the true risk. 
The result is traffic congestion.  
Financial crashes and car crashes have common psychological roots. One of the causes of 
the  crisis  was  an  under-pricing  of  risk.  That  was  rooted  in  disaster  myopia  –  an 
under-estimation  of  risk  during  the  so-called  Great  Moderation.  Memories  of  financial 
disaster had faded, with the Great Depression in almost no-one’s experience sample. The 
upshot was an over-healthy appetite for risk-taking. 
The  subsequent  crash  has  turned  these  behaviours  on  their  head.  Memories  of  financial 
disaster  are  now  fresh,  as  after  the  Great  Depression,  causing  an  over-estimation  of  the 
probability of a repeat disaster. In these situations, psychological scarring is likely to result in 
risk appetite and risk-taking being lower than reality might suggest. Risk will be over-priced. 
Today, the very disaster myopia that caused the crisis may be retarding the recovery.  
Disaster myopia may be more potent in the markets than on the motorways. Asset prices are 
guesses about the future. Faced with uncertainty about the future, market participants form 
these guesses using their own heuristics. One such heuristic is the “popular narrative” – a 
simple story that aims to make sense of reality. Risk on/risk off is precisely such a popular 
narrative.4  
The effect of popular narratives is to increase psychological contagion in financial markets. 
Simple  stories  generate  market  mood  swings.  The  greater  the  uncertainty,  the  more 
compelling  the  simple  story  and  the  greater  the  amplitude  of  these  mood  swings.  These

swings  in  turn  result  in  a  detachment  of  risk  perceptions,  and  hence  asset  prices,  from 
reality.  
Financial trauma, like personal trauma, can increase this detachment from fundamentals. For 
those who lived through it, the Great Depression had a lasting effect on financial risk-taking. 
“Depression  Babies”  have  been  shown  to  seek  less  risky  capital  structures  and  to  avoid 
financial stocks.5 The scarring effects of the Great Depression on risk attitudes help explain 
the excess premium demanded by equity investors during the previous century.6 The Great 
Depression left risk-taking scars that lasted a lifetime. 
The Great Depression has now been lost from most investors’ experience sample. Indeed, 
that fact might help explain another popular narrative from the past – the Great Moderation. 
But the Great Depression has recently been replaced in investors’ experience sample by the 
Great Recession. Whether this will spawn an era of “Recession Babies”, with a permanently 
lower appetite for financial risk-taking, remains to be seen. But past evidence suggests that 
any recovery in risk appetite might take time – more time than fundamentals would imply.  
All of these behavioural elements have come together in today’s financial markets – disaster 
myopia, intrinsic uncertainty and deep trauma. This may help explain why risk-takers have 
their foot poised on both brake and accelerator, why risk capital is in stop-start mode. That 
implies  a  risk  of  heavy  and  persistent  financial  congestion  in  the  period  ahead.  With 
hindsight,  Roosevelt’s 
in  1933  was  well-founded,  economically  and 
psychologically. It may also be being repeated.

fiscal  policy, 
The role of macro-prudential policy 
As  long  as  aversion  to  risk-taking  is  causing  financial  congestion,  growth  (like  traffic)  will 
remain sluggish. The public policy question, then, is whether anything can be done to allay 
the fear factor, speed the repair of balance sheets and stimulate risk-taking.  
Experience during the Great Depression taught us a great deal about the role of fiscal and 
monetary policy in these situations. Indeed, in many respects the Great Depression was the 
birthplace  of  activist  monetary  and 
today’s  conventional  arms  of 
macro-economic policy. For different reasons, however, these arms are at present close to 
fully  stretched.  In  countering  the  fear  factor,  that  begs  the  question  of  what  else  might  be 
done?  
With fortuitous timing, there is a new tool in the box, a third arm of macro-economic policy. 
This is so-called macro-prudential policy. As its name implies, this policy tool is intended to 
meet  macro  ends  using  prudential  means.  The  UK  has  recently  put  in  place  an  explicit 
macro-prudential regime. In July of last year, the UK government announced a new Financial 
Policy Committee (FPC) to execute macro-prudential policy.7 The FPC is housed in the Bank 
of England and met for the first time in June this year.  
The  FPC’s  objective  is  to  protect  and  enhance  the  resilience  of  the  UK  financial  system 
against risks including “unsustainable levels of leverage, debt or credit growth”. Therein lies a 
key  FPC  challenge.  There  is  evidence  of  unsustainably  high  levels  of  leverage  in  some 
sectors.  But  elsewhere,  there  is  evidence  of  credit  growth  being  unsustainably  low.  Some 
companies  remain  over-leveraged.  Yet  others  are  suffering  a  credit  shortage,  with  bank 
lending to companies continuing to contract over the past 12 months.

In framing macro-prudential policy today, both these factors need to be weighed: on the one 
hand,  enhancements  to  the  risk-bearing  capacity  of  the  financial  system  to  repair  balance 
sheets; on the other, encouragement for the risk-taking capacity of the system to boost credit 
supply. These factors can sometimes point in subtly different directions. The first might point 
to higher buffers to boost banks’ risk-bearing capacity, while the second might point to lower 
buffers to boost their risk-taking capacity. 
Faced with that balancing act, one of the FPC’s recommendations in June was for banks to 
raise  their  levels  of  capital  opportunistically.  That  meant  banks  should  retain,  rather  than 
distribute to shareholders or staff, any windfall profits. Additional retained profits could then 
be used either as insurance against future risk (risk-bearing) and/or to finance extra lending 
(risk-taking).  In  other  words,  opportunistic  capital-raising  could  help  banks  hit  the  twin 
objectives of risk-bearing and risk-taking with a single stone. 
Looking ahead, the balance of these forces may tilt again. Risk-taking is in retreat. And past 
crisis experience suggests that the contraction of lending internationally may have further to 
run  (Chart  17).  The  FPC,  like  the  MPC,  needs  to  act  symmetrically  in  response  to  these 
developments. Its job is to cushion the fall as well as arrest the rise in credit and debt.  
One  practical  role  for  macro-prudential  policy  in  these  situations  is  to  communicate  about 
risks to the system to better enable these risks to be priced. If risk is over-priced, and agents 
over-pessimistic,  communicating  that  might  help  in  correcting  overshoots  in  risk  appetite. 
That was precisely the role played by Roosevelt’s inauguration speech in 1933. It provided 
an alternative, more optimistic, popular narrative for financial markets. It aimed to reduce the 
risk of psychological contagion. It worked. Risk appetite and real activity recovered between 
1933  and  1937.  A  more  optimistic  popular  narrative  might  have  a  role  to  play  in  helping 
correct today’s market pessimism. 
A  second  practical  role  for  macro-prudential  policy  is  to  make  recommendations  for  how 
regulation might contribute towards moderating the credit cycle. The Basel Committee has 
recently  developed  guidelines 
tool  –  banks’ 
counter-cyclical  capital  buffer.  This  guideline  is  based  on  deviations  in  the  ratio  of 
credit-to-GDP from its long-term trend. This has been shown to be a reliable early warning 
indicator  of  future  crises  across  a  wide  range  of  countries.  It  is  akin  to  a  Taylor  rule  for 
macro-prudential policy.  
Chart 18 plots the path of the UK credit-to-GDP guide-path over recent years. Unsurprisingly, 
it  suggests  that  UK  banks’  capital  ratios  should  have  been  tightened  in  the  run-up  to  the 
crisis,  with  credit-to-GDP  above  its  long-term  trend  by  up  to  10  percentage  points.  That 
disequilibrium  has  since  been  completely  eliminated  as  credit  growth  has  collapsed. 
Currently, the guide-path is close to cycle-neutral. Any further fall would put credit below its 
cycle-neutral level, implying a loosening to support risk-taking. 
Setting  regulation  to  boost  risk-taking  may  feel  like  a  new  and  radical  departure  from  the 
past.  But  in  fact  it  is  neither  as  radical  nor  as  new  as  it  might  first  appear.  In  1938,  the 
US was facing a double-dip recession. Criticism of banks’ unwillingness to lend to the real 
economy  was  rampant.  Fear  in  financial  markets  was  mounting.  The  situation  was  eerily 
reminiscent of today.  
At  that  point,  Roosevelt  turned  macro-prudential.  In  the  Uniform  Agreement  on  Bank 
Supervisory Procedures, a relaxation of prudential and valuation standards was announced 
for US banks. This aimed explicitly to support lending and activity in the real economy, “the 
activist goal of liberalizing bank examinations to make them dynamically adjustable to current 
economic policies”.8 It worked. Lending and growth resumed.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
In the period since, the first two arms of macro-economic policy – monetary and fiscal – have 
been used actively. The third – macro-prudential – has been tied behind policymakers’ back. 
The crisis of the past few years has highlighted the need to free the macro-prudential arm of 
policy. As in the 1930s, macro-prudential policy may have a role to play in shouldering the 
heavy burden of damaged balance sheets and diminished risk appetites.

the  population.  Total  sample  size  varies  over  time, 
ranging from around 14,000 in 1990 to over 90,000 in 
2000. Changes in the composition of the data set may 
reduce  comparability  over 
time.  Subsidiaries,  as 
identified  from  company  structures,  are  excluded. 
Company  accounts  are  assigned  to  calendar  years 
according to the statement date. The real estate sector 
is  identified  using  SIC  (2003)  and  SIC  (1992)  codes 
(the sample ranges from around 450 to 1,600 firms).
