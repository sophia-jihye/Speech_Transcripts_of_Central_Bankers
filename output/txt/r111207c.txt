Svante Öberg: Monetary policy’s Catch-22 – uncertainty 
Speech  by  Mr  Svante  Öberg,  First  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  to  invited 
guests at the Sveriges Riksbank, Stockholm, 6 December 2011. 
 Monetary  policy  has  to  be  based  on  forecasts.  But  our  ability  to  make  forecasts  is  almost 
non-existent. This is what I call the Catch-22 of monetary policy.1 
This is, somewhat incisively, what my speech is about. One can also describe it as follows. 
Monetary policy acts with a lag and must therefore be based, at least partly, on forecasts. 
The  problem  is  that  our  forecasting  ability  is  very  limited  –  small  at  one  year  ahead  and 
almost non-existent at two and three years ahead. We should therefore put more energy into 
analysing the economy’s initial position and making forecasts for the coming year. Further 
ahead it is more a question of producing possible scenarios for economic developments. 
I intend to devote this speech to the subject of how to view uncertainty in monetary policy. I 
shall  begin  by  describing  my  own  earlier  experiences  of  forecasts  and  uncertainty.  I  shall 
then go on to describe the uncertainty in the Riksbank’s forecasts. After this, I shall discuss 
how one should view uncertainty and monetary policy, first in theory and practice, and then in 
nine  suggestions  for  monetary  policy.  I  shall  conclude  with  some  reflections  on  monetary 
policy and summarise my main message. 
Forecasts are usually wrong 
I learned how difficult it is to make forecasts during my time at the Ministry of Finance and at 
the National Institute of Economic Research. During different periods I was responsible for 
both medium-term forecasts and cyclical forecasts at the Ministry of Finance. The medium-
term forecasts within the framework of the long-term surveys were to a great extent a more 
or less sophisticated projection of trends. They missed recessions and were only accurate 
when reality followed the previous trend (see Figure 1).2 
The  Ministry  of  Finance’s  cyclical  forecasts  are  based  on  more  information,  including 
changes in taxes and expenditure in the government budget. Like the forecasts made at the 
Riksbank,  they  are  used  as  a  basis  for  policy  decisions.  But  they  are  also  usually  wrong, 
which is a problem with regard to using fiscal policy to stabilise economic activity. Sometimes 
political aspects also have significance, such as when we deliberately had cautious forecasts 
as  a  basis  for  the  budget  consolidation  in  the  1990s  (see  Figure  2).  It  would  be  less  of  a 
problem if things turned out better than we were expecting than if they turned out worse.3 
At  the  National  Institute  of  Economic  Research  Professor  Lars-Erik  Öller  and  others 
systematically  analysed  the  forecasting  performance  of  the  institute  itself  and  others,  with 
regard to both Sweden and other countries.4 The results showed that the forecasting errors 
for GDP growth and inflation were large, but that the forecasts in the autumn for the coming 
year were nevertheless better than simple (naïve) forecasts, such as using the average of 
earlier years as a forecast. The studies showed that there was a certain forecasting ability up

to one year ahead, but no further than that. The same limitations have also been noted in 
many other studies, both in Sweden and abroad.  
After these experiences I came to the Riksbank, where monetary policy is to a large extent 
based on forecasts several years ahead. It wasn’t very easy dealing with this task, given my 
previous  experiences.  I  have  discussed  the  Riksbank’s  forecasting  ability  in  an  earlier 
speech, on the basis of an analysis made at the Riksbank.5 I shall in this speech describe 
how I now view monetary policy and uncertainty, after six years at the Riksbank. 
Uncertainty in the Riksbank’s forecasts 
In this section I shall describe the uncertainty in the Riksbank’s forecasts. At the same time, I 
would like to emphasise that the aim is not to assert that the Riksbank’s forecasts are better 
or  worse  than  anyone  else’s.  My  assessment  is  that  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  National 
Institute of Economic Research and the Riksbank make forecasts of roughly the same quality 
seen over time. My aim is to describe the uncertainty and then to discuss how it should be 
dealt with in conducting monetary policy. At the Riksbank we regularly report the uncertainty 
in  our  forecasts.  We  do  this  in  the  form  of  scenarios  that  describe  developments  under 
different assumptions, in report texts when we run through different areas and in fan charts, 
which show how accurate the forecasts usually are.  
GDP and inflation – limited forecasting ability one year ahead, none at two and three 
years ahead 
The Monetary Policy Reports and Updates include, for instance, four standard figures that 
show the uncertainty of the forecasts. Three of them refer to GDP growth, CPI inflation and 
CPIF inflation. They show 50 per cent, 75 per cent and 90 per cent uncertainty bands for the 
forecasts of up to three years ahead (see Figures 3–5). The uncertainty bands are based on 
the Riksbank’s historical forecasting errors for these variables.6 The uncertainty increases as 
the forecast horizon lengthens. 
When  one  evaluates  forecasts,  one  usually  compares  the  current  forecasts  with  a  naïve 
forecast. Here I shall use the average of the series as a naive forecast. The forecasting error 
is measured as the standard deviation between outcomes and forecasts and the forecasting 
error  for  the  naïve  forecast  is  measured  as  the  standard  deviation  for  the  outcomes 
themselves. The forecasting performance can then be expressed as how much smaller the 
actual forecasting error is than the forecasting error of the naive forecast. This measure of 
the forecasting performance is 1.0 if our forecasts are perfect and 0.0 if our forecasts are no 
better than the historical average. 
Figure  6  shows  the  forecasting  performance  for  GDP  growth  and  CPI  inflation  at  
1–12 quarters ahead.7 As the figure refers to annual percentage changes, the first quarters 
are mixtures of known outcomes and forecasts. It is only four quarters after the most recent 
known outcome that we have pure forecasts. The figure shows that the forecasting error with 
regard to forecasts one year ahead is just over 20 per cent less than the forecasting error for 
the  intended  naïve  forecast  and  not  at  all  less  two  and  three  years  ahead.  There  is  thus 
some forecasting performance for GDP growth and CPI inflation up to one year ahead, but

no  forecasting  performance  in  the  longer  run.  At  two  and  three  years  ahead  we  had  on 
average  made  equally  good  forecasts  if  we  had  used  the  average  growth  or  inflation  rate 
instead of our own forecasts.8 
Unemployment – better forecasting ability than for GDP and inflation 
Unemployment is more sluggish than GDP growth. If unemployment is very high to start with, 
it is probable that it will also be high in a year’s time. This should mean that the forecasting 
ability for unemployment, and other measures of resource utilisation, are better than for GDP 
growth  and  inflation.  Our  forecasting  performance  with  regard  to  unemployment  is  quite 
rightly slightly better, with a forecasting error one year ahead that is 30–40 per cent lower 
than  the  forecasting  error  for  the  naïve  forecast  (see  Figure  7).9  However,  there  is  still  no 
forecasting ability two and three years ahead. 
The repo rate – is sometimes outside of the uncertainty bands 
The fourth standard figure in our Monetary Policy Reports and Updates refers to the forecast 
for the repo rate and the uncertainty concerning this (see Figure 8). There is an important 
difference of principle between the decision on the repo rate up to the next monetary policy 
meeting and the assessment of the repo rate path after that, that is, the forecast for the repo 
rate over the coming three years. We are careful to point out that the repo-rate path is “a 
forecast, not a promise”. The uncertainty bands shown in the figure are based on forecast 
errors for risk-adjusted market rates from 1999 to 2007 and after that on the Riksbank’s own 
forecast errors. The uncertainty increases as the forecast horizon lengthens, here, too. The 
figure  shows,  for  instance,  that  the  repo  rate  in  three  years’  time  will  with  a  90  per  cent 
probability be between 0 and 7 per cent. And there is a 10 per cent probability that it will be 
outside of this interval! 
The fact that the repo rate is sometimes outside of the uncertainty bands is illustrated by the 
forecast in September 2008 just before the financial crisis hit Europe and Sweden with full 
force (see Figure 9). The repo rate was cut over the following three quarters to a much lower 
level than the lower limit for the 90 per cent uncertainty band. 
Uncertainty in theory 
Our forecasting ability is thus very limited one year ahead and almost non-existent two and 
three years ahead. The best forecast we can then make is normally to assume that inflation 
will  be  2  per  cent  in  two  and  three  years’  time.  But  that  is  not  much  help  when  shaping 
monetary  policy.  At  the  same  time  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  monetary  policy  will 
actually affect inflation two and three years ahead and that we therefore need forecasts as a 
basis for monetary policy. So what can we do to manage the uncertainty in monetary policy?  
In a linear model, where inflation depends on the interest rate and an uncertainty term with a 
mean  value  of  zero,  where  the  parameters  are  known  and  constant,  and  with  a  quadratic 
objective  function  (loss  function),  the  uncertainty  does  not  matter  with  regard  to  which 
interest  rate  should  be  chosen  to  minimise  the  loss  function.10  It  is  enough  to  take  into 
                                                 
8  Prior to 2007 we first based the forecasts on a constant repo rate and then on estimated market expectations. 
It is possible that we could have made better forecasts with a different interest rate assumption. To be able to 
comment more strongly on forecasting ability, one should actually base the calculations on longer periods of 
time. One should also compare with the historical series available at the time the forecasts were made. 
9  The figure is based on the period 2005–2010.

account the mean value for the forecast: the uncertainty over future shocks does not affect 
the optimal monetary policy (in technical terms one says that certainty equivalence holds). 
The uncertainty then does not affect the decision on the repo rate, but it does affect target 
fulfilment.  
However, there are several aspects that mean that one cannot rely on the results obtained in 
this type of model. The Riksbank reports a main forecast that is not merely a model forecast; 
it  is  based  on  both  models  and  judgement.  It  is  not  easy  to  explicitly  report  all  of  the 
assessments and deliberations behind the overall results. However, it is possible to do this 
within the framework of a formalised model like the Riksbank’s macro model Ramses.11 But 
of  course,  this  is  not  a  perfect  description  of  reality.  There  is  uncertainty  over  both  the 
structure of the model and its parameters. Other models would probably reach other results 
with regard to the most appropriate monetary policy.  
Another  question  concerns  the  nature  of  the  forecasts.  The  forecasts  the  Riksbank  now 
reports  are  in  principle  intended  to  be  unbiased  forecasts.  But  as  Goodhart  and  Rochet 
pointed  out  in  their  evaluation  of  the  Riksbank’s  work,  these  assumptions  do  not  hold  in 
reality.12 In practice, longer-term forecasts are rarely unbiased. They can rather be regarded 
as possible scenarios contingent on certain external conditions. Normally, there are several 
possible scenarios and there can be great uncertainty over which scenario monetary policy 
should be based on.  
There is also uncertainty over which target variables should actually be used. I shall return to 
this question in the next section. 
Nine suggestions regarding monetary policy 
Although  it  may  be  simple  in  theory  to  determine  how  to  manage  uncertainty  in  monetary 
policy,  it  is  not  at  all  simple  in  practice.  So  how  should  the  uncertainty  surrounding  our 
forecasts  affect  the  monetary  policy  decisions?  How  should  we  deal  with  the  Catch-22  of 
monetary policy, that monetary policy must be based on forecasts but that our forecasting 
ability is almost non-existent? This is what this section is about. 
Be clear regarding the monetary policy objective 
We should be clear about the objective of monetary policy. There should be no uncertainty 
about what this is. The Riksbank has worded it as keeping inflation measured in terms of the 
consumer price index (CPI) at 2 per cent a year and the Government and the Riksdag (the 
Swedish  parliament)  have  expressed  support  for  this.  But  the  CPI  is  affected  by  our  own 
decisions on the repo rate in that mortgage rates are included in the CPI. If we raise the repo 
rate to subdue inflation in the long run, this leads to inflation temporarily increasing instead of 
falling. We therefore also follow and analyse a large number of other measures of inflation, 
such  as  the  CPI  with  a  fixed  interest  rate  (CPIF).  These  are  better  indicators  of  the 
underlying inflationary pressures. Moreover, in the longer run CPI inflation and CPIF inflation 
coincide. 
But  it  has  turned  out  that  uncertainty  sometimes  arises  as  to  which  target  variable  the 
Riksbank  uses,  whether  it  is  the  CPI  or  the  CPIF.  Sometimes  it  has  been  said  that  target 
fulfilment would be better if CPIF inflation was closer to 2 per cent during the forecast period, 
even if this means that CPI inflation is further from 2 per cent. I don’t believe this is correct.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
However,  it  is  natural  to  highlight  the  CPIF  as  a  measure  of  underlying  inflation  when  the 
forecasts  for  the  CPI  and  the  CPIF  differ,  and  this  is  because  of  the  Riksbank’s  own 
monetary policy.13 
Be clear about resource utilisation 
The Riksbank also endeavours to stabilise production and employment around sustainable 
paths of development. However, neither the Riksbank nor the Government and Riksdag have 
specified what are considered to be sustainable paths for production and employment. We 
usually try to ensure that resource utilisation is normal towards the end of the forecast period. 
However,  it  is  not  entirely  clear  what  we  mean  by  resource  utilisation.  We  use  a  broad 
approach  to  describe  resource  utilisation  and  make  an  overall  assessment  based  on  a 
number of different measures. Some measures are based on GDP, employment, the number 
of hours worked and unemployment related to a normal or sustainable level. For example, 
GDP is related to potential GDP and unemployment to a sustainable level. Other measures 
are  based  on  business  tendency  surveys  and  other  high-frequency  data.  But  no  forecasts 
are made for these. Uncertainty is not reported for any of these measures in the same way 
as for GDP growth and inflation, either at the starting point or during the forecast period. 
We  should  be  clearer  about  what  we  mean  by  resource  utilisation.  As  things  stand  now, 
there  is  no  unanimous  agreement  among  the  Executive  Board  regarding  how  to  define 
resource  utilisation  as  a  target  variable.  Of  course,  it  is  an  undesirable  situation  that 
something  as  important  as  a  target  variable  for  monetary  policy  is  not  clearly  defined.  It 
should not be a question for individual Executive Board members to determine the objective 
for monetary policy; it should be a question for the Riksbank as an institution, or even for the 
Government and Parliament. 
I believe that we should use the GDP gap as the main measure of resource utilisation. This is 
despite the well-known difficulties in determining the GDP gap.14 I believe that one can make 
a fairly good assessment of the GDP gap by combining a production function approach with 
business  tendency  data  and  other  short-term  statistics.15  GDP  is  a  central  variable  in  the 
forecasting  work  and  the  variable  that,  despite  its  well-known  deficiencies  in  measuring 
welfare, is most closely-related to welfare.16 We should also report fan charts with uncertainty 
bands  for  the  GDP  gap  and  other  measures  of  resource  utilisation,  in  particular 
unemployment, to illustrate the uncertainty in these measures, too. 
It  is  important  to  make  good  judgements  of  resource  utilisation  at  the  outset  and  to 
endeavour  to  ensure  it  is  neither  too  high  nor  too  low  in  the  coming  period.  This  can 
contribute to stabilising inflation close to the target. Resource utilisation is namely not only a 
target  variable,  but  also  an  indicator  of  future  inflation.  Figure  10  shows  the  correlations 
between  some  measures  of  resource  utilisation  –  GDP  gap,  hours  worked  gap,  labour

shortages and the RU indicator17 – and CPI inflation.18 The correlation is highest for a lag of 
4–6 quarters.  
Also take into account credit expansion and asset prices 
We should take credit expansion and asset prices into account more when we formulate our 
monetary  policy.  And  we  should  develop  and  formally  integrate  the  forecasts  for  credit 
growth and asset prices into the base for the monetary policy decisions, as well as reporting 
the uncertainty of the forecasts.  
Far too many countries have allowed their expansion in credit to be too high for too many 
years and this has led to very large problems when the bubbles have burst. The low interest 
rates  have  been  a  contributory  factor  to  this  trend.  There  has  also  been  a  recent  shift  in 
opinions  coming  out  of  academic  research,  from  a  broad  resistance  to  taking  financial 
stability into account when shaping monetary policy19 to greater openness to the view that 
there may be good reasons for doing so.20 
Even before the financial crisis hit Europe and Swedish with full force in autumn 2008, there 
were  concerns  in  the  Executive  Board  that  the  credit  expansion  was  too  rapid  and  that 
housing prices were increasing too quickly so that a bubble might build up, and later burst to 
cause a severe recession. This was not the case in Sweden, but did happen in the United 
States  and  several  countries  in  Europe.  During  the  crisis years  2009–2010  the  endeavour 
was instead to use low interest rates and liquidity assistance to the banks to avoid a credit 
crunch that could intensify the crisis. And we succeeded well in this. During the entire period, 
the banks’ total lending to households and companies in Sweden increased (see Figure 11). 
Put greater emphasis on the initial situation and the forecasts for the coming year 
We should put greater emphasis on the initial position and the forecasts for the coming year 
than  on  the  long-term  forecasts.  At  the  Riksbank,  considerable  resources  are  put  into 
analysing the state of the economy. The statistics received are analysed and commented on 
regularly.  A  large  number  of  models  have  been  developed  to  assess  the  current  situation 
(what is known as nowcasting) and how we should revise our forecasts in the light of new 
statistics. We should continue with this work. 
Personally, I have put a lot of time and energy into analysing the forces behind inflation. This 
has included analysing various measures of underlying inflation, understanding what affects 
the difference in inflation in the euro area and in Sweden, keeping up-to-date with what is 
happening  in  the  wage  bargaining  rounds  in  the  labour  market,  understanding  how 
developments in the global economy affect the prices of food, commodities and energy, how 
inflation  expectations  develop,  the  level  of  resource  utilisation  when  measured  in  different 
ways  and  how  the  measures  of  resource  utilisation  have  been  affected  by  the  recession 
following on from the financial crisis.

Focus on the repo rate over the coming six months 
Correspondingly, we should concentrate on assessing the repo rate in the coming period, as 
there is such great uncertainty over the repo rate in the longer run. The Riksbank sets the 
repo rate. This means that we normally have a fairly good idea of the repo rate level over the 
coming period, although the situation can sometimes change rapidly and radically as it did in 
autumn 2008. Market expectations prior to a monetary policy meeting also normally agree 
with the decision we make regarding the repo rate. Any surprises in the actual decision on 
the repo rate are normally very minor (see Figure 12).  
However, there is great uncertainty over the repo rate in the longer run. This is illustrated by 
the fan chart showing the repo rate. Whether the repo rate path will agree with the forecast 
will of course depend on how the economy develops in the future. If inflation and resource 
utilisation  develop  in  line  with  the main  scenario,  the  repo  rate  should  follow  the  repo-rate 
path outlined in the main scenario (the middle line in the figure). However, the uncertainty 
regarding the way the economy will develop leads to uncertainty over the future interest rate, 
too, which is reflected in the fan around the repo-rate path.  
My impression is that there is normally very little opportunity to influence market expectations 
further  than  six  months  ahead  by  publishing  a  repo-rate  path.  Goodhart  and  Rochet  also 
show in their evaluation that it is the Riksbank’s repo-rate path that adjusts to market rates 
rather than vice versa, except in the short term, when the influence is mutual. But they also 
point  out  that  the  data  period  is  so  short  that  it  is  not  possible  to  draw  any  far-reaching 
conclusions.21 
Check against other monetary policy frameworks 
We should check the repo rate produced in our forecasts and models against other monetary 
policy  frameworks.  Personally,  I  usually  check  to  see  whether  the  repo  rate  level  is 
reasonable  by  looking  at  what  the  Taylor  rule  would  imply.  In  the  original  Taylor  rule,  the 
policy rate is determined by inflation and the GDP gap.22 According to this rule, the policy 
rate shall be set equal to the long-term level of the policy rate plus 1.5 times the deviation in 
inflation from target plus 0.5 times the deviation in GDP from potential GDP. The Taylor rule 
has the advantage that it is based solely on information in the current situation and not on 
forecasts.  Measured  inflation  is  used  as  an  indicator  of  future  inflation,  which  may  be 
reasonable if there is some sluggishness in the inflation process. It may also be reasonable 
to include resource utilisation, as this affects future inflation. 
The Taylor rule functioned well in connection with the financial crisis 2008–2009. It showed 
then that we should cut the repo rate at roughly the same speed and by roughly as much as 
we cut it. If we had instead relied on the Ramses model, we would have cut the repo rate 
much more slowly. Ramses has an estimated monetary-policy rule that is based on how the 
Riksbank has reacted earlier, and this has normally involved changing the repo rate in small 
steps. The starting point for the repo rate therefore has a strong influence as to what level 
the model will produce for the repo rate in the short term. The model’s estimated rule was 
therefore  far  too  sluggish  in  the  exceptional  situation  that  arose.  It  can  also  be  mentioned 
that Norges Bank, because of the uncertainty of the models it uses, also gives some weight 
to simple monetary-policy rules such as the Taylor rule.23

See longer-term forecasts than one year as potential scenarios 
We should regard the forecasts for longer than one year ahead as potential scenarios rather 
than unbiased forecasts. It is quite simply impossible to make any reliable forecasts for two 
and  three  years  ahead.  My  opinion  is  that  it  is  normally  fairly  meaningless  to  have  a  firm 
opinion  of  what  will  happen  in  two  and  three  years’  time.  But  there  are  exceptions, 
particularly  in  situations  where  resource  utilisation  is  very  low.  During  2008–2009  we 
assessed  that  the  repo  rate  would  be  at  an  exceptionally  low  level  for  one  year  and  we 
backed this up by lending around SEK 300 billion to the banks at this low interest rate for one 
year.  
We should continue to report a main scenario for economic developments and the repo rate 
over the coming three years, a scenario where inflation approaches 2 per cent and resource 
utilisation  approaches  a  normal  level.  But  we  should  regard  this  merely  as  a  potential 
scenario. It is important that monetary policy follows a predictable pattern. We endeavour to 
avoid surprising the market. This means that we normally change the repo rate and the repo-
rate path in gradual small steps, where the steps are due to new information received since 
the most recent monetary policy meeting, and that we react in roughly the same way to the 
same  type  of  changes  in  the  new  information.  Such  stability  means  that  we  can  avoid 
causing problems on the financial markets, and that we can have a greater impact on the 
markets when an unexpected event occurs. 
We should also continue to analyse the consequences of various sequences of events. This 
can be how monetary policy should be adjusted to the rate of the recovery from the financial 
crisis,  how  global  market  prices  and  exchange  rates  may  affect  monetary  policy,  the 
monetary  policy  consequences  of  alternative  outcomes  in  central  wage  agreements,  what 
will happen if the sovereign debt crisis in Europe worsens, and so on. We should therefore 
continue to make forecasts and draw up alternative scenarios as a basis for our monetary 
policy. 
Report the uncertainty involved in comparisons of repo-rate paths 
We  should  report  the  uncertainty  involved  in  the  comparisons  of  forecasts  for  economic 
developments with different repo-rate paths that we regularly describe in our Monetary Policy 
Reports.  
Calculations of alternative scenarios are often made using Ramses, for practical reasons. My 
personal  opinion  is  that  the  calculated  effects  of  changes  in  the  repo-rate  path  are 
unreasonably large. If this is the case, we would need to adjust the repo rate more so that 
monetary  policy  is  well  balanced.  However,  one  can  in  theory  show  that  the  greater  the 
uncertainty  prevailing  as  to  the  effects  of  the  interest  rate  on  inflation,  the  less  monetary 
policy should react when inflation deviates from the target. 
Within  the  framework  of  Ramses  it  is  possible  to  place  in  order  of  preference  different 
monetary-policy alternatives in figures, based on their average squared deviations from the 
targets  for  inflation  and  resource  utilisation  during  the  forecast  period  (see  Figure  13).24 
These figures, unlike the fan charts shown earlier, do not report the uncertainty. Goodhart 
and Rochet point out in their evaluation that the construction with mean squared deviations 
has its limitations, as it focuses on central expected outcomes and thus overestimates the 
certainty in comparisons of alternative outcomes and that the figures should be accompanied 
by fan charts that show the probability intervals for both production and inflation.25 I consider 
it important to calculate and report the uncertainty in the comparisons, if this type of figure is 
going to be used to a greater extent.

Develop the models so they can process different repo-rate paths 
We  should  develop  our  models  so  that  they  can  process  different  repo-rate  paths.  One 
problem with regard to the base for monetary policy decisions is that the Ramses model can 
only process one repo-rate path. It cannot handle a situation where the Riksbank’s repo-rate 
path differs from the market’s repo-rate path. The repo-rate path used in a forecast with the 
Ramses  model  also  implicitly  determines  the  current  longer-term  interest  rates  along  the 
entire  yield  curve,  and  these  may  differ  from  the  interest  rates  currently  observed  in  the 
market.  This  means  that  problems  arise  with  regard  to  analysing  developments,  when  the 
Riksbank’s repo-rate path differs from the market’s repo-rate path. Further development of 
the model would improve the base for monetary policy decisions. 
I think that monetary policy can best be understood in terms of the yield curve. The Riksbank 
implements its monetary policy by determining the repo rate, the interest rate the banks face 
when depositing money in accounts with the Riksbank overnight, or when borrowing money 
overnight. Thus, the Riksbank determines the short end of the yield curve. But the market 
determines the long end. Everything in between is a combination of the Riksbank’s influence 
and market forces. The long end is affected by many factors, not merely expectations of the 
repo rate. It may, as recently, be a question of a flight to safety, which has pushed up, for 
instance,  Greek  interest  rates  and  pushed  down  American,  German  and  Swedish  interest 
rates. The Swedish yield curve is currently much lower than is consistent with the Riksbank’s 
repo-rate path (see Figure 14).  
Moreover,  the  banks’  lending  rates  are  affected  by  other  factors  than  the  repo  rate,  which 
has  led  to  increased  spreads  between  the  repo  rate  and  the  banks’  lending  rates.  This 
means that what is known as the transmission mechanism – how the Riksbank’s repo rate 
affects economic developments – has probably changed. But it is difficult to say how it has 
changed. On the whole, we should develop the financial part of our macroeconomic models 
to give greater consideration to the financial markets. 
Conclusion 
When I look back at monetary policy since the current monetary-policy regime, with a floating 
exchange rate and an inflation target, was introduced at the beginning of 1993, I think that it 
has on the whole functioned fairly well. One might possibly think that monetary policy was 
too  tight  in  1994–1995  when  the  Riksbank  raised  the  repo  rate  at  the  same  time  as  the 
budget  consolidation  work  was  holding  back  inflation.  However,  it  was  important  to  bring 
down inflation and inflation expectations to a much lower level than in the 1970s and 1980s. 
One  might  also  think  that  the  assumption  of  an  unchanged  repo  rate  that  was  used  as  a 
basis for the forecasts during the first years was too simple. On the other hand, one has to 
see this more as a part of the communication strategy that was being followed then. And it 
worked. Inflation expectations fell and have been established close to the target. 
I also think that monetary policy has worked well during the six years, 2006–2011, that I have 
been a member of the Riksbank’s Executive Board. CPI and CPIF inflation have on average 
been  1.7  and  1.8  per  cent  a  year  respectively.  This  is  somewhat  lower  than  the  inflation 
target. However, given that the world has undergone the deepest recession since the 1930s 
during  this  period,  it  should  nevertheless  be  regarded  as  a  good  result.  Moreover,  the 
Riksbank  contributed  to  slowing  down  the  fall  in  production  and  employment  when  the 
financial  crisis  hit  Sweden  with  full  force  in  autumn  2008.  Partly  by  quickly  and  forcefully 
cutting  the  repo  rate,  and  partly  by  supplying  around  SEK  500  billion  in  liquidity  to  the 
banking system. 
I have in this speech discussed the uncertainty in monetary policy. As monetary policy acts 
with a lag, it must be based, at least partly, on forecasts. However, our forecasting ability with 
regard to GDP growth and inflation is very limited one year ahead and largely non-existent 
two and three years ahead. This is what I have called the Catch-22 of monetary policy.

We  should  therefore  place  greater  emphasis  on  analysing  the  initial  situation  and  making 
forecasts for the coming year. We should also concentrate on assessing the repo rate over 
the coming six months, as there is such great uncertainty over the repo rate in the longer run. 
The level of the repo rate should be checked against other monetary policy frameworks, such 
as the Taylor rule. And we should be clear about the objective of monetary policy. 
We should regard the forecasts for longer than one year ahead as potential scenarios rather 
than  unbiased  forecasts.  We  should  continue  to  report  a  main  scenario  for  economic 
developments  and  the  repo  rate  in  the  coming  three  years,  in  which  inflation  approaches 
2 per  cent  and  resource  utilisation  approaches  a  normal  level,  but  we  should  regard  it  as 
such – a potential scenario. We should also continue to analyse the consequences of other 
sequences of events.  
The  base  for  monetary  policy  has  improved  gradually  since  the  current  monetary  policy 
regime, with a floating exchange rate and inflation target, was introduced. A large number of 
models have been developed and the forecasts are now based on the Riksbank’s repo-rate 
path  that  can  differ  from  the  market’s  forward  rate  curve.  However,  the  base  should  be 
developed further. I have taken up some such areas in this speech:  
 
The forecasts for the GDP gap and other measures of resource utilisation should be 
developed further and the description of the uncertainty in these forecasts should be 
shown in the same way as the uncertainty in the GDP growth and inflation forecasts.  
The Riksbank should also take into account credit expansion and asset prices in its 
monetary  policy.  The  forecasts  for  credit  growth  and  asset  prices  should  be 
developed and formally integrated into the materials on which the monetary policy 
decisions are based. In this case, too, it is important to show the uncertainty in these 
forecasts.  
The  Riksbank’s  models  should  be  developed  to  be  able  to  handle  the  difference 
between  the  Riksbank’s  repo-rate  path  and  the  market’s  forward  rate  curve.  We 
should also describe the uncertainty in comparisons of different repo-rate paths.  
  Monetary policy is a more or less continuous process. We normally make decisions on the 
repo  rate  and  renew  our  assessment  of  the  repo-rate  path  every  second  month.  There  is 
always considerable uncertainty over economic developments, particularly in the longer run. 
But  that  does  not  matter  so  much.  We  gradually  adapt  our  monetary  policy  to  new 
information and new forecasts to be able to keep inflation close to the target and resource 
utilisation at a sustainable level.
