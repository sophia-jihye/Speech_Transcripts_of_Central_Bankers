Introduction 
Mr. President of the Senate’s Finance Commission, Senator José García Ruminot, senators 
members of this Commission, ladies, gentlemen. I am grateful for your invitation to present 
the vision of the Board of the Central Bank of Chile on recent macroeconomic developments, 
their prospects and implications for monetary policy making, which is contained in detail in 
our March 2012 Monetary Policy Report. 
When we presented our previous Report to this Commission last December, the international 
financial  markets  –  and, 
the  Chilean  market  
too – were going through significant tension. The outlook for growth in Chile and in the world 
at  large  reflected  great  uncertainty,  and  there  was  significant  risk  of  the  situation  in  the 
Eurozone  aggravating  and  becoming  the  Lehman  Brothers’  downfall  of  September  2008 
revisited. We then were emphatic in saying that the Chilean economy was healthy, but that 
the  crisis  abroad  could  end  up  affecting  our  growth  prospects.  We  also  said  that  the 
magnitude of those effects was difficult to estimate. In that context, we lowered the growth 
range  forecast  for 2012  and  pointed  out  that, given  the  international  threats  facing  us, the 
balance of risks for growth was biased downward. We stated our willingness to take action in 
order  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  external  scenario  on  the  Chilean  economy,  having  the 
necessary tools to deal with adverse situations. 
Thus,  in  late  December  we  took  exceptional  measures  to ease  the frictions  present  in  the 
domestic money market and, in January, we preemptively reduced the monetary policy rate 
(MPR) by 25 basis points. Facing the uncertain external situation, the expectations of most 
market analysts and brokers anticipated the need for further reductions of the MPR. 
With the passing of time, we have seen a somewhat more favorable evolution of the external 
scenario. In general, confidence has partially returned to global financial markets, expressed 
in lower risk spreads and higher commodity prices. The outlook for world growth is still weak, 
even lower than our expectations in December, but the likelihood of a more adverse scenario 
has decreased.  
In  Chile,  domestic  demand  and  output  have  outperformed  December’s  projections. 
Meanwhile,  inflation  has  also  exceeded  projections  and  core  inflation  measures  have 
normalized rapidly. All this has modified the balance of risks for the Chilean economy from 
December  to  date.  Some  months  ago,  the  biggest  risk  was  that  a  deteriorated  external 
scenario could trigger a sharper deceleration of domestic demand and output and, thus, of 
inflation too. Today, the medium-term growth and inflation risks are unbiased, although in the 
short-term there are greater inflation-related risks. 
Our monetary policy is based on an inflation target two years ahead, so it requires having an 
opinion  with  respect  to  the  most  likely  evolution  of  the  macroeconomic  scenario  and 
associated risks. We are continually on the lookout for news about the local and international 
economic environments, checking them for consistency with our vision of the most likely or 
other  alternative  scenarios.  To  do  so,  we  need  to  permanently  adapt  our  vision  on  the 
economy and conduct monetary policy with flexibility, being careful not to overreact to one-
time  news  that  could  trigger  excessive  pessimism  or  optimism  that  occasionally  affect  the 
expectations of consumers, businesses or investors in the financial markets. This prudence

in  our  assessment  of  the  state  of the  economy  and  related  risks  is  vital  for  us  to properly 
meet our obligations. At the same time, it is our job to provide grounds for our vision about 
the macroeconomic scenario and its consequences on the orientation of our monetary policy.  
The developments of recent months exemplify this. Many market agents’ opinions pointed at 
the  Chilean  economy  being  severely  hit  by  the  external  situation.  However,  incoming  data 
have  shown  us,  as  I  said,  that  the  risks  coming  from  abroad  are  smaller  than  we  thought 
before. Also that the domestic economy has continued to grow strongly, which is reflected in 
our GDP growth range for this year that we have revised upward from December.  
The tensions we saw at the end of last year in external financial markets have eased, thanks 
to a combination of facts. On one hand, the provision of three-year loans by the European 
Central Bank helped to alleviate banks’ liquidity and sovereign debt problems. On the other 
hand,  the  second  rescue  package  for  Greece  and  the  debt  swap  with  the  private  sector 
warded  off  the  possibility  of  a  disorderly  outcome  there.  And  somewhat  better  output  and 
employment  indicators  for  the  U.S.  have  been  disclosed.  Thus,  the  markets’  volatility 
decreased,  risk  and  liquidity  spreads  fell,  the  dollar  depreciated  in  international  markets, 
while asset prices rose, and so did commodity prices. 
All considered, the risks in the external scenario, although more limited, are still significant. 
The  economies  of  peripheral  Europe  need  substantial  funding  this  year  and  next.  The 
governments  must  implement  large  fiscal  adjustments,  which  in  practice  may  encounter 
increasing political and social resistance, the same as the financing of new rescue packages 
in the surplus economies in the region. The economic, social and political costs are paid in 
the short term and may create tensions, while its fruits can only be reaped in the medium 
term.  Furthermore,  the  banking  system  is  facing  capitalization  challenges  that  may  curtail 
credit to the private sector. Rigidities of exchange rates and wages delay the resolution of 
competitiveness problems in some economies. All this, aside from shaping a very frail growth 
scenario in the zone, opens the door to new stress episodes in external financial markets. 
Although so far the international scenario has not been as negative as was expected, taking 
for granted that the slower global growth and tensions in external financial markets will not 
affect our economy is not wise thinking. 
Thus, while the inflation trajectory in Chile, the stronger growth in demand and output and 
changes in certain prices such as oil and fresh fruits & vegetables, have risen the risks for 
short-term inflation, the risks in the external scenario are still significant. 
Let me now describe the macroeconomic scenario assumed in our Monetary Policy Report. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
Relative  to  December,  world  growth  shows  no  major  change  on  aggregate,  although  its 
composition has changed and, certainly, so have the associated risks. In the United States, 
improved  figures  of  job  creation,  manufacturing  output  and  expectations  reflect  on  upward 
revisions to forecasts for this year, partly offsetting the gloomier outlook for the Eurozone. A 
somewhat  deeper  recession  is  expected  in  the  zone  for  this  year,  which,  due  to  its 
commercial  and  financial  links,  reflects,  albeit  marginally,  in  revised  growth  projections 
elsewhere,  especially  in  emerging  Europe  and  Asia.  With  respect  to  December  forecasts, 
trading partners’ growth is unchanged for 2012 and 2013. 
The  baseline  scenario  also  assumes  that  the  oil  price  will  remain  high  for  longer  than 
projected in December. It also raises projections for the copper price to averages of US$3.7 
and  US$3.6  per  pound  this  year  and  next.  This  translates  into  better  terms  of  trade  than 
previously  thought  (table  1).  Greater  appetite  for  risk  has  also  fostered  a  resumption  of 
capital inflows to emerging economies. Facing reduced tensions, many emerging economies’ 
central banks have suspended their processes of enhanced monetary stimulus they began in 
the second half of 2011.

In Chile, the external financial turbulence has had limited impact, and a number of the signs 
of spill-over that were perceived in late 2011 have reverted, at least partially. Money market 
frictions  have  eased.  Stock  markets  and  the  exchange  rate  have  returned  to  values  from 
before the resurgence of international financial tensions, although corporate risk premiums 
are now higher than they were in mid-2011. At the statistical cutoff date of this Report, the 
peso had appreciated nearly 6% against the dollar, since the closing of December’s Report. 
Considering the current level of the nominal exchange rate and the parities prevailing at the 
closure  of  this  Report,  the  real  exchange  rate  (RER)  is  estimated  to  be  within  the  range 
consistent with its long-term fundamentals. 
On  the  other  hand,  domestic  output  and  demand  have  grown  faster  than  forecast  in 
December. After losing strength in the third quarter of 2011 – which was the information at 
hand  at  the  closing  of  the  December  Report  –  output  figures  of  the  fourth  quarter 
accelerated. Domestic demand has posted high y-o-y growth rates, yet declining. The same 
has occurred with consumption, supported by a strong labor market. The unemployment rate 
is  near  its  fifteen-year  low,  which  also  reflects  on  the  evolution  of  wages.  Consumers’ 
expectations have improved in the past few months. On the investment side, the dynamism 
of  engineering  works  –  mainly  related  to  energy  and  mining  projects  –  and  the  recent 
recovery  of  building  are  worth  signaling  out.  Other  indicators  are  consistent  with  a 
moderation  of  demand  and  output,  such  as  the  lower  y-o-y  growth  rates  of  durable 
consumption  and  imports.  In  addition,  the  slower  pace  of  growth  in  employment,  labor 
income and consumer loans suggests a deceleration going forward. The Board’s evaluation 
is that output gaps are closed, which is also based on signs of a tight labor market and a 
rapid normalization of core inflation. 
Y-o-y  CPI  inflation  is  above  the  tolerance  range,  while  core  measures  hover  around  3%, 
growing  at  a  faster  pace  than  in  the  last  quarter  of  2011  and  forecasts  in  the  December 
Report. Still, as I just said, the level of core measures is consistent with our assessment of 
the  state  of  output  gaps.  The  recent  inflation  trend  is  also  explained  by  the  behavior  of 
transport fares and the prices of fresh fruits & vegetables. The latter, probably affected by 
climatic conditions, have followed a pattern that contrasts with their usual patterns and have 
declined in the past few months. Market inflation expectations have risen, particularly for the 
short term, but are still close to 3% over the policy horizon. 
In this Report’s baseline scenario we foresee that GDP will grow this year between 4% and 
5%. This range is higher than December’s, as it responds largely to the faster output growth 
of late 2011 and early 2012. In addition, a number of the risks that were examined in the last 
Report  have  moderated  and  the  dynamic  of  the  domestic  demand  adjustment  will  be 
somewhat  more  gradual  than  was  envisaged  in  December.  This  scenario  assumes  a 
stronger  impulse  from  abroad,  associated  with  better  terms  of  trade  and  external  credit 
conditions. Overall, the occurrence of temporary and limited frictions in international financial 
markets is a possibility that cannot be ruled out. We also assume that growth will continue to 
approach its trend levels – which the Board still estimates at 5% – and respond to the lagged 
effects of the increases made to the MPR in 2011 (table 2). 
The baseline scenario foresees a current account deficit in 2012 that is virtually unchanged 
from the December forecast: 3.4% of GDP, after posting a deficit of 1.3% of GDP in 2011. 
This enlargement obeys primarily to a bigger deficit of the trade balance, determined mainly 
by the copper price, which is down from 2011. Furthermore, the oil price has risen from last 
year. In trend prices, in 2012 the current account would post a deficit of somewhat less than 
6% of GDP, not very different from that of 2011. 
We foresee y-o-y CPI inflation hovering around 4% well into the second half of this year, to 
later converge to 3% and remain there until the end of the projection horizon, this time the 
first  quarter  of  2014.  Y-o-y  changes  in  core  measures  will  continue  to  rise  in  the  coming 
months, and will converge to 3% more slowly than the CPI (figure 1).

This foreseen trajectory is based on the assumption that the propagation of supply shocks to 
other  prices  will  occur  according  to  historic  patterns.  It  also  assumes  that  wages  will  be 
adjusted  on  the  bases  of  productivity  and  the  inflation  target,  and  that  the  RER  will  not 
change much. On the fiscal side, the baseline scenario estimates that the structural deficit 
will converge to 1% of GDP towards the end of the current Administration, as announced by 
the authority and in conformity with the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Finally, it uses as a working 
assumption that the MPR will follow a path comparable to the one that can be derived from 
the prices of financial assets observed at the statistical cutoff of this Report (figure 2). 
The  baseline  scenario  reflects  the  events  that  the  Board  believes  to  be  the  most  likely  to 
occur with the information at hand at the statistical cutoff date of the Report. However, there 
are  risk  scenarios  which,  if  materialized,  may  alter  the  macroeconomic  outlook,  with 
implications on monetary policy. On this occasion, after assessing the alternative scenarios, 
the Board estimates that the risk balance for both output and inflation is unbiased. 
Although the risks in the international scenario are similar to those in previous Reports, their 
possibility  of  occurrence  is  smaller.  Still,  structural  issues  persist  in  the  Eurozone,  so  the 
regained confidence in financial markets is yet to be consolidated. Repeated or intensified 
financial  stress  episodes,  in  a  context  where  banks  are  more  cautious  in  their  lending 
decisions  and  capital  requirements  have  increased,  could  deepen  credit  constraints, 
complicating the growth outlook for the region and the world at large. 
There  are  also  persistent  doubts  about  how  China’s  slowdown  will  be.  If  more  intense,  its 
effects will not only hinder world growth, but also pull down commodity prices, especially for 
copper.  Conversely,  other  economies  could  well  perform  better  than  expected,  and  offset 
part of these effects.  
The  calmer  external  financial  markets  and  the  renewed  appetite  for  risk  have  revived 
concerns  about  how  to  accommodate  the  new  capital  flows  into  emerging  economies. 
Prolonging the strong monetary stimuli in the developed world, particularly in the U.S., may 
foster an extension of global imbalances. Public indebtedness is elevated in the U.S. and the 
high oil price hinders the resolution of its external deficit. 
Now  there  is  also  the  worsening  of  geopolitical  tensions  surrounding  Iran  which  could 
significantly affect the oil price, with negative effects on world growth and stronger pressures 
on inflation. 
In Chile, the persistence of strong domestic spending may alter the baseline scenario in two 
ways. On one hand, it may intensify the inflationary risks now perceived, and increase the 
propagation  of  supply-side  shocks,  like  those  in  oil  or  fresh  fruits  & vegetables.  It  is  also 
possible  that  the  velocity  at  which  core  inflation  has  increased  is  associated  with  tighter 
output gaps than assumed in the baseline scenario. On the other hand, the sustained growth 
in  domestic  demand  may  trigger  a  widening  of  the  current  account  deficit  and  amplify  the 
effects of shocks from abroad on the Chilean economy, especially if accompanied by a falling 
copper price. 
Let me share with you some final thoughts. 
Final thoughts 
The  macroeconomic  environment  just  described  has  opposing  effects,  as  there  are 
significant risks from different fronts. 
As I said, the baseline scenario uses as a working assumption that the MPR will follow a path 
comparable to the one that can be derived from the prices of financial assets observed at the 
statistical cutoff of this Report. Any deviations away from this trajectory will depend on the 
implications of domestic and external macroeconomic developments on the inflation outlook. 
As I also said at the beginning, while risks for short-term inflation have increased, the risks 
from abroad are still important and may cause significant damage to the Chilean economy.

Accordingly,  the  complexity  of  the  present  scenario  calls  for  particularly  prudent  monetary 
policy making. 
On the side of domestic output, the projections we are now presenting show stronger growth, 
mainly because recently output and demand have risen above December’s forecasts. On the 
prices side, our evaluation points at a higher level of inflation, especially in the short run. Our 
view that output gaps are closed implies that economic growth should converge to its trend in 
order not to cause imbalances that end up being very costly. Experience has taught us how 
damaging  an  increase  in  inflation  can  be,  particularly  to  the  poorer  population.  It  has  also 
taught  us  the  importance  of  expenditure  not  growing  excessively,  in  order  to  avoid 
imbalances in the external accounts that erode our capacity to deal with shocks of different 
kinds.  This  is  especially  true  at  this  moment,  when  we  are  confronting  these  risks  of  the 
domestic economy with doubts about how warranted this better mood of external markets is. 
The situation of developed economies is very complex, and teaches a great lesson in how 
phenomena that are overlooked and not addressed on time may end up taking a massive toll 
on the people. 
For all this, I want to stress the importance of proper management of the expectations about 
the behavior of our economy and, of course, of our monetary policy. Prudent monetary policy 
conduct  means  being  prepared  for  any  scenario,  assessing  them  carefully,  and  adjusting 
policy as required. Let me reiterate the commitment of the Board of the Central Bank of Chile 
with a monetary policy oriented at keeping inflation low and stable. This is certainly the best 
contribution we can make to the prosperity of our country. 
Thank you.
