Ewald Nowotny: Achieving balanced growth in the CESEE countries 
Opening remarks by Prof Dr Ewald Nowotny, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic 
of  Austria,  at  the  Conference  on  European  Economic  Integration  (CEEI)  2012,  jointly 
organized by the central banks of Finland and Austria, Helsinki, 26 November 2012. 
 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, 
Let  me  reflect,  first  of  all,  on  the  title  of  this  conference:  Why  is  balanced  growth  an 
important issue? 
We are now already in the fifth year of the crisis and the storm is not over yet. The crisis has 
taught  us  that  the  economic  difficulties  of  many  countries  in  Europe  reflect  long-term 
problems inherent in economic and political institutions. There are no quick fixes for these 
long-term issues, but it is crucial to take the right measures now.  
On the one hand, it is important to contribute effectively to business cycle stabilization and to 
support a smooth recovery in Europe. For instance, the reduction of both public and private 
sector  indebtedness  is  necessary  for  regaining  the  trust  of  international  investors.  At  the 
same  time,  however,  a  vicious  circle  of  consolidation  measures  which  erode  domestic 
demand and therefore delay the recovery has to be avoided. 
On the other hand, from a medium-term perspective, the right measures have to be taken to 
avoid  a  renewed  build-up  of  unsustainable  economic  positions.  Achieving  sustainable 
economic  growth  and  thereby  rethinking  the  appropriate  growth  model  is  of  utmost 
importance in solving the current economic challenges.  
This  especially  holds  true  for  the  countries  in  Central,  Eastern  and  Southeastern  Europe 
(CESEE), where the boom-bust cycle has been extraordinarily pronounced and the catching-
up of income levels to those in Western Europe has been set back for several years since 
the outbreak of the crisis. 
From my point of view,  one of the most relevant questions in this context is the following: 
How can we implement a sustainable growth model that remains crisis-resilient and 
promotes  the  catching-up  process  in  CESEE?  Let  me  look  into  both  issues  – 
sustainability and convergence – in more detail now. 
Sustainability 
What  is  our  understanding  of  balanced  or  sustainable  growth?  It  means  –  first  and 
foremost – that we aim to avoid large business cycle fluctuations as the frequent occurrence 
of sizable boom-bust cycles is associated with significant economic costs, affecting the long-
run growth potential of an economy. Second, sustainable growth also implies that economic 
growth  is  diversified  as  much  as  possible  to  avoid  the  economy’s  dependence  on  the 
performance  of  a  few  sectors,  which  makes  the  economy  more  vulnerable  in  the  case  of 
asymmetric  shocks.  Last,  but  not  least,  I  also  want  to  point  out  the  social  dimension  of 
growth – every group in society should benefit from the growth process such that the build-up 
of  social  inequalities  and  the  resulting  pressure  on  political  economic  institutions  can  be 
contained. 
With these considerations of balanced growth in mind, let us briefly look back on the pre-
crisis economic developments in CESEE in order to have a reference for the intensity of 
the recession in 2009 and the related adjustment process since then.

Between 2000 and 2007, the CESEE countries were – besides China and India – one of the 
fastest  growing  regions  in  the  world  (average  real  GDP  per  capita  growth:  8.2%).  This 
outstanding growth performance was mainly driven by large foreign capital inflows, which 
fuelled domestic credit growth, led to a surge in asset prices (in particular house prices) and 
considerably boosted domestic demand.  
However, as you can see in chart 1, the sizable GDP growth was generated on the back of 
rising vulnerabilities. Soaring prices and wages were one of the consequences of sharply 
rising  domestic  demand.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  double-digit  inflation  rates  were  not  unusual 
during  the  boom  years.  On  top  of  very  strong  lending  growth  in  the  years  preceding  the 
crisis,  a  large  part  of  domestic  loans  to  households  and  companies  was  –  and  in  some 
countries still is – denominated in foreign currency.  
Growing internal imbalances were also reflected by the development of the external sector. 
Increasing  internal  demand  led  to  an  appreciation  of  the  exchange  rates  in  countries  with 
floating exchange rate regimes, which made exports more expensive and led to the build-up 
of substantial current account deficits. 
Several institutions, including the OeNB, pointed out the macrofinancial risks associated with 
these  widening  imbalances.  However,  during  the  boom  years  it  was  admittedly  hard  to 
predict whether these developments were actually unsustainable and a threat to growth or 
just the outcome of a brisk catching-up process, which would eventually reach an equilibrium 
point.  In  other  words,  the  borderline  between  a  buoyant  convergence  process  and  an 
overheated economy is a very narrow one – at least for real-time assessments.  
In  the  end  the  capital  inflow-based  growth  model  proved  to  be  unsustainable.  As  a 
matter  of  fact,  up  to  2008  nobody  could  imagine,  first,  that  advanced  economies  will  be 
confronted with such a severe recession and, second, that a shock originating from Western

economies  would  spill  over  to  such  a  strong  extent  to  the  countries  in  CESEE.  But  the 
accumulated  vulnerabilities  fully  materialized  when  capital  flows  into  the  CESEE  countries 
dropped  sharply  after  the  default  of  Lehman  Brothers  in  September  2008.  This  situation, 
combined with the collapse of global trade and limited room for maneuver for countercyclical 
policy  measures,  led  to  a  deep  recession  in  2009.  It  has  been  widely  acknowledged  (for 
example  by  the  EBRD  in  its  transition  report1  or  a  recent  book  by  the  IMF’s  European 
Department2)  that  the  countries  that  had  the  largest  imbalances  before  the  crisis  were  hit 
hardest afterwards.

Chart 2 shows that the output loss related to the 2009 recession was extraordinarily large in 
the Baltics, followed by  Southeastern Europe and Central Europe. It took at least until the 
end of 2011 to reach again the 2008 per capital real GDP levels. While this also holds true 
for Western European EU Member States, it becomes clear from chart 2 that the catching-up 
of income levels in CESEE to those in Western Europe has lost considerable momentum. 
 Convergence 
This brings me to the second part of my remarks: convergence.

Since  the  fall  of  the  Iron  Curtain  more  than  20  years  ago,  the  CESEE  countries  have 
undergone  an  impressive  catching-up  process. Europe  has  grown  together  in  many  ways: 
increased  trade  and  FDI  integration,  improved  infrastructure,  greater  regulatory  and  legal 
homogeneity and the adoption of best practices with respect to the setup of institutions and 
corporate governance. All these factors led to a substantial narrowing of income differences 
during the last two decades.

The 2008–09 crisis had a significant negative impact on this convergence process. Chart 3 
shows  that  the  medium-term growth differential  between  the  CESEE  EU  Member  States 
and the euro area has decreased from 3–4 percentage points before the crisis to less than 
2 percentage points now. The positive growth margin of the CESEE EU Member States was 
reduced to 0.5 percentage points in 2010 and remained positive only thanks to the robust 
performance  of  Poland.  As  a  result,  the  catching-up  process  will  take  more  time  than 
expected during the pre-crisis boom years. In fact, OeNB simulations show that if the growth 
differential remains below 2 percentage points, it will take more than 50 years for the CESEE 
region to reach the income level of the euro area (compared with only 37 years if the growth 
differential would regain its pre-crisis level of 3 percentage points)3. Also, the catching-up is

less smooth due to large swings in CESEE cycles, particularly for small countries, as will be 
discussed tomorrow in a presentation of the OeNB4.  
A  delayed  catching-up  process  poses  serious  challenges  to  further  economic  and 
institutional  reforms  in  CESEE  and  might  affect  the  people’s  support  for  European 
integration. A continuous reduction of regional inequalities in Europe is also in the interest of 
Western Europe, given that – according to recent studies – a reduction of income inequality 
has beneficial effects on the long-run growth potential of an economy.  
Conclusion 
Let me conclude: 
Pronounced boom-bust cycles not only lead to high output volatility but also hurt the long-
term growth prospects of an economy. This is especially valid for the CESEE economies that 
experienced  a  sharp  output  decline  in  2009  and  –  according  to  our  latest  OeNB-BOFIT 
projections – there might even be a second recession phase in the wings in several countries 
of the region.  
The main lesson from the 2008–09 crisis  is  that  the foreign  capital  inflow-based growth 
model is not sustainable in the long run and cross-country contagion via trade and financial 
channels from Western to Eastern Europe can be quick and substantial.  
Many countries undertook severe restructuring programs during the last years which aimed 
at  reducing  their  public  and  private  sector  indebtedness  and  increasing  their  external 
competitiveness. However, we will have to watch the success of these programs very closely 
in the upcoming years.  
We  also  saw  that  the  economic  adjustment  costs  caused  by  high  output  volatility  are 
substantial,  as  they  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  speed  of  the  catching-up  of  Eastern 
European income levels to those in Western Europe. A substantial delay in the convergence 
process cannot be in our interest. 
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we have to find new growth models that prove to be 
sustainable and crisis-resilient and continue to promote the convergence process  – 
and this is one of the goals of this year’s CEEI. Ladies and gentlemen, I once again welcome 
you to this year’s CEEI, I wish you a stimulating and productive conference and thank you for 
your attention.
