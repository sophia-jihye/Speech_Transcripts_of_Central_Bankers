Karolina Ekholm: Monetary policy, business cycle stabilisation and 
macroprudential policy 
Speech by Ms Karolina Ekholm, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, to a meeting at 
the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, Stockholm, 13 March 2013. 
 The views expressed in this speech are my own and are not necessarily shared by the other members of the 
Executive Board of the Riksbank. I would like to thank Kerstin Hallsten, Kerstin af Jochnick, Cecilia Roos-
Isaksson, Lars E. O. Svensson, Anders Vredin and Barbro Wickman-Parak for their comments and Magnus 
Wiberg for help with drafting the speech. 
As  I  am  sure  most  of  you  know,  I  have  in  recent  years  advocated  a  more  expansionary 
monetary  policy  than  the  policy  that  has  actually  been  conducted.  That  I  have  done  so 
recently, when the growth of the Swedish economy has been relatively weak, is perhaps not 
so surprising. On the other hand, it may be more difficult to understand the reasons for my 
stance in 2010, when the Swedish economy had growth rates of over 5 per cent. However, 
as I intend to explain today, I believe that demand has been too low in Sweden ever since 
the global financial crisis seriously affected the Swedish economy in the autumn of 2008. The 
low level of demand is ultimately the result of weak economic development around the world, 
which is subduing the demand for Swedish exports and making households and companies 
more  pessimistic.  In  my  opinion,  however,  this  could  have  been  counteracted  by  a  more 
expansionary monetary policy. 
Today I intend to describe the factors that in my view indicate that aggregate demand has 
been too low in recent years, and to explain why, as I see it, monetary policy and fiscal policy 
have not been used to a greater extent to counteract low demand. My explanation is by and 
large  that  the  possibility  to  use  monetary  policy  and  fiscal  policy  to  stabilise  aggregate 
demand  has  been  limited  by  concerns  about  financial  stability.  Even  though  Sweden  has 
coped well with the financial crisis, I believe that it has left decision-makers with the feeling 
that  they  have  just  had  a  near-death  experience.  Financial  stability  has  therefore  come  to 
seem  far  more  important  that  standard  business  cycle  stabilisation.  This  prioritisation  may 
well be reasonable. However, I believe that it is important to the Swedish economy that we 
have an effective policy for business cycle stabilisation at the same time as we conduct a 
policy to promote financial stability. I will discuss how this should be done towards the end of 
my speech. 
Low aggregate demand since the financial crisis 
When Sweden was hit by a collapse in the demand for Swedish export products at the end of 
2008,  GDP  fell  heavily.  However,  it  did  not  take  long  for  GDP  to  rise  again  and  in  2010 
growth figures reached almost record levels. To a certain extent, these high growth figures 
were of course a natural consequence of the major fall in GDP in late 2008 and early 2009. 
But, in contrast to many other countries, GDP in Sweden also began to exceed its pre-crisis 
level relatively quickly (see Figure 1).

 However, despite the relatively favourable development of GDP, it seems that unemployment 
has  become  entrenched  at  a  high  level.  Initially  unemployment  increased  less  than  we 
expected given the substantial fall in GDP – it peaked at 9 per cent in early 2010 – but since 
then it has fallen no lower than 7.6 per cent (see Figure 2). In my view, this is a level that is 
much higher than what can be considered a long-run sustainable unemployment rate.1

1  Long-run sustainable unemployment rate here refers to the level of unemployment that is expected to prevail 
when  all  cyclical  shocks  have  abated,  when  ongoing  structural  changes  have  had  a  full  impact  and  when 
inflation expectations are equal to the actual rate of inflation. See for example “The long-term development of 
the  Swedish  labour  market”,  Monetary  Policy  Report,  July  2012.  See  also  “Correction  of  the  Riksbank’s 
estimate  of  the  long-run  sustainable  employment  rate”,  Appendix  2  of  the  minutes  of  the  monetary  policy 
meeting, July 2012, for a discussion of the role of expectations in the assessment of the long-run sustainable 
unemployment rate.

Unemployment has also begun to increase again in recent months and our latest forecast 
predicts that it will increase further to reach 8.2 per cent in the third quarter of this year.

Developments  thus  indicate  that  we  have  had  spare  capacity  on  the  labour  market  since 
2008. This is one of the reasons why inflation has been low in recent years. It also appears 
that inflation has in principle shown a downward trend since 2008. As the Riksbank’s repo-
rate  changes  have  a  major  impact  on  inflation  measured  in  terms  of  the  CPI,  it  is  in  this 
context most relevant to look at inflation measured in terms of the CPIF, that is the CPI with a 
fixed mortgage rate (see Figure 3). 
As  can  be  seen  in  the  figure,  CPIF  inflation  was  around  3  per  cent  when  the  Swedish 
economy was hit by the fall in demand at the end of 2008. It is now down to levels of around 
1 per cent. 
The fact that Sweden has a substantial surplus on its current account, as shown in Figure 4, 
also indicates that domestic demand is relatively low.

 The current account reflects the difference between the value of what is produced and the 
value  of  what  is  absorbed  in  the  economy  through  consumption  and  investments.  It  also 
shows the difference between total saving and total investment in the economy. The fact that 
Sweden has a surplus thus means that saving in Sweden is higher than the level needed to 
fund Swedish investments. 
An important reason why saving has been relatively high in Sweden since the mid-1990s is 
the relatively high level of financial saving in the public sector since the budget consolidation 
process  carried  out  in  connection  with  the  crisis  of  the  1990s.  Another  reason  is  that  the 
Swedish households also increased their saving in connection with this crisis. At the same 
time,  the  level  of  investment  in  Sweden  has  been  relatively  low  compared  to  that  in  other 
countries (see Figure 5). This is largely due to relatively low investments in housing.2

The  current  account  surplus  has  in  fact  decreased  somewhat  in  recent  years.  It  was 
approximately  9  per  cent  of  GDP  in  2008  and  approximately  7  per  cent  of  GDP  in  2011. 
However, it is still high in historical terms and in comparison with other countries. It is hard to 
see that there are any major advantages for the Swedish households of a significant part of 
their incomes being used to fund investments abroad, which in reality is what this means. To 
me,  this  is  another  sign  that  demand  is  too  low  in  Sweden.  Low  demand  is  restraining 
consumption so that saving is high, and is also restraining investment. 
My  interpretation  of  developments  regarding  the  labour  market,  inflation  and  the  current 
account is thus that demand in the Swedish economy has been far too low since Sweden 
was hit by the fall in demand in the autumn of 2008. Although both monetary policy and fiscal 
policy have been used to counteract the fall in demand, this has not compensated in full for 
weak economic development abroad and for the weakening optimism of the households and 
companies.  
The fact that unemployment was relatively high in Sweden already prior to the financial crisis 
(as can be seen in Figure 2, unemployment has averaged just over 7 per cent since 1999) 
and that the current account surplus has been substantial since the second half of the 1990s, 
raises  the  question  of  whether  aggregate  demand  has  been  weak  in  an  even  longer 
perspective.  My  colleague  Lars  E.  O.  Svensson  has, 
that 
unemployment has been unnecessarily high since the mid-1990s because monetary policy 
has  not  been  used  to  a  sufficient  extent  to  counteract  shocks  that  have  pushed  down 
inflation.3 It is of course important to determine what the situation was with regard to resource 
utilisation before the financial crisis in order to be able to assess the level that unemployment 
should eventually fall to. But this is not the issue that I intend to focus on today: my focus 
for  example,  claimed

here  is  instead  on  the  issue  of  how  economic  policy  could  be  used  more  effectively  to 
stabilise business cycle fluctuations in the future despite the risks to financial stability.    
Limited stimulation from fiscal policy 
In contrast to the situation in many European countries and the United States, there was a 
significant  surplus  in  public  net  lending  in  Sweden  when  the  financial  crisis  began.  In  the 
euro area and the United States, public net lending as a percentage of GDP had shown an 
average  deficit  of  just  under  2  per  cent  during  the  10  years  before  the  crisis.  The 
corresponding figure for Sweden was a surplus of over 1 per cent; in line with the so-called 
surplus target.4 The much stronger state of public finances than in many other countries was 
largely  a  consequence  of  the  fiscal  policy  framework  that  has  gradually  been  developed 
since  the  1990s.5  This  put  Sweden  in  a  much  better  initial  position  in  terms  of  its  public 
finances when the financial crisis began. 
Fiscal  policy  contributes  to  stabilising  business  cycle  fluctuations  without  any  specific 
decisions being made through the so-called automatic stabilisers; that is through the fact that 
tax  revenues  fall  and  expenditure  for  various  grants  and  benefits  increases  automatically 
when economic activity declines and unemployment increases.6 However, in addition to this, 
active decisions can also be made that affect revenues and expenditure. Despite the severe 
downturn in 2008–2009, public net lending in Sweden fell to only –1 per cent of GDP in 2009. 
This  is  much  less  than  in  the  euro  area,  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  United  States  (see 
Figure 6). 
Public indebtedness has increased substantially in the United States and in many European 
countries in recent years, partly as a result of the automatic stabilisers and partly as result of 
government intervention in the financial sector to deal with systemically-important banks that 
have experienced problems. In these countries, the scope to influence the economy using 
fiscal-policy stimulation measures is therefore very limited today. The countries that have the 
weakest public finances in Europe are forced to implement tightening measures despite the 
weak state of their economies because the high level of debt is creating uncertainty about 
the  ability  of  the  countries  to  repay  further  loans.  In  Sweden,  on  the  other  hand,  there  is 
scope for active fiscal-policy stimulation measures if they were needed. 
                                                 
4  OECD Economic Outlook, November 2012; IMF WEO, October 2012. The surplus target is that public sector 
net lending should average one per cent of GDP over an economic cycle. 
5  The fiscal-policy framework comprises a budget-policy framework, principles for stabilisation policy, principles 
for government intervention on the financial markets and principles for openness and transparency. In turn, 
the  budget-policy  framework  comprises  a  surplus  target  for  the  public  sector  as  a  whole,  an  expenditure 
ceiling  for  the  central  government,  and  demands  that  the  local-government  sector  should  exercise  sound 
financial management and have balanced budgets and a strict budget process. 
6  Automatic stabilisers consist of the effects that arise when tax revenues and various grants and benefits adapt 
to the economic cycle without active decisions being made.

 It is important in this context to remember that the primary aim of the fiscal-policy framework 
that we have in Sweden is to make public finances sustainable in the long term. Prior to the 
financial crisis, the greatest threat to the long-term sustainability of public finances appeared 
to  be  an  ageing  population.7  An  ageing  population  increases  the  demands  on  the  public 
sector  at  the  same  time  as  the  extent  to  which  the  sector  can  be  funded  by  taxes  on 
employment income decreases. 
However,  the  experience  gained  in  countries  where  the  need  to  rescue  systemically-
important  banks  has  exerted  great  pressure  on  public  finances  has  given  us  a  somewhat 
different perspective. In a country like Sweden, which has a large banking system in relation 
to the size of the economy, a banking crisis could quickly have a devastating effect on public 
finances. Given this, the risk of a financial crisis is therefore perhaps the greatest potential 
risk to the long-term sustainability of public finances. The need to save for a rainy day also 
probably  appears  to  be  greater  as  it  is  much  easier  to  manage  a  financial  crisis  if  public 
finances are strong from the outset. It is for this reason that I believe that the willingness to 
use fiscal policy to stimulate demand in the economy is limited by concerns about financial 
stability. 
At present, therefore, we should probably not expect fiscal policy to contribute much more 
than  the  effects  of  the  automatic  stabilisers  when  it  comes  to  stimulating  the  Swedish 
economy. The Riksbank’s forecast is that public net lending will be negative at –1.1 per cent 
of GDP this year. However, it is expected to gradually increase to 0.3 per cent of GDP in 
2015 as economic activity improves. 
The  fact  that  fiscal  policy  is  not  contributing  more  actively  to  stimulate  demand  in  the 
economy  is,  however,  completely  in  line  with  the  established  procedure  for  stabilisation

General Government Finances - Developments Will Require More Hours  Worked”, The  Swedish Economy,

policy in Sweden as I perceive it. In my view, the main responsibility for active business cycle 
stabilisation has lain with monetary policy since the crisis of the 1990s.8 However, this view is 
based on a flexible interpretation of our inflation target in the sense that the target comprises 
a stabilisation of the development of the real economy.9 
Too little stimulation from monetary policy 
Monetary  policy  also  became  much  more  expansionary  when  demand  in  the  Swedish 
economy fell rapidly in late 2008 and early 2009. Between October 2008 and July 2009, the 
repo rate was cut by a total of 4.5 percentage points to the record-low level of 0.25 per cent, 
and it remained at this level for a year (see Figure 7).

 However, the Riksbank began to raise the repo rate in July 2010 and in July 2011 it was at 
2.0 per cent. Since then, the repo rate has been cut again in a number of steps to 1.0 per 
cent as the weak development in the euro area has had a negative impact on the Swedish 
economy.  As  can  be  seen  in  Figure  7,  policy  rates  in  the  United  States  and  the  United 
Kingdom have remained close to zero throughout this period. The ECB began to raise the 
policy rate in the euro area in 2011, but quickly had to begin cutting it again. 
                                                 
8  The  spring  budget  bill  for  2008  describes  situations  in  which  discretionary  fiscal  policy  is  justified  as  “crisis 
situations or in connection with supply shocks where fiscal policy may need to support monetary policy”. The 
Swedish Fiscal Policy  Council interprets this to mean  that, in the government’s view, the Riksbank has the 
main responsibility for business cycle stabilisation. See Chapter 1 of the 2011 report of the Swedish Fiscal 
Policy Council, “Swedish Fiscal Policy”.

Many  central  banks  have  also  conducted  so-called  unconventional  monetary  policy  by 
purchasing assets or providing liquidity at longer maturities than normal in other ways.10 All in 
all, this has led to a more expansionary monetary policy in large parts of the rest of the world 
than in Sweden, despite the fact that the repo rate is at an historically low level. 
The  fact  the  Swedish  monetary  policy  has  been  less  expansionary  than  in  many  other 
countries may seem reasonable considering that the Swedish economy has also performed 
much  better  than  that  of  many  other  countries.  This  is  particularly  true  in  comparison  with 
other European countries, as shown in Figure 1. But, it is a problem that monetary policy has 
not been expansionary enough to keep inflation at a rate of around 2 per cent and to bring 
unemployment down to a long-run sustainable rate. 11  
Why  hasn’t  monetary  policy  been  expansionary  enough?  One  reason  is  that  to  a  certain 
extent we overestimated the strength and duration of the temporary recovery in the Swedish 
economy in 2010 and therefore also overestimated inflationary pressures. Another reason is 
the fear that a more expansionary monetary policy would increase the risks associated with 
household  indebtedness.  Here,  it  is  once  again  the  events  in  other  countries  during  the 
financial  crisis  that  have  given  rise  to  such  fears.  In  several  countries  with  a  high  level  of 
household indebtedness and high housing prices, substantial falls in housing prices have led 
to a fall in consumption demand, which in turn has weakened the development of the real 
economy.  In  some  areas,  this  has  also  led  to  higher  loan  losses  and  risks  to  financial 
stability. 
Risks associated with household indebtedness 
Personally, however, I do not believe that the risks associated with household indebtedness 
have  represented  a  weighty  argument  against  conducting  a  more  expansionary  monetary 
policy recently. There is of course every reason to avoid a situation in which housing prices 
fall  dramatically.  However,  I  find  it  difficult  to  see  that  current  developments  regarding 
housing  prices  and  loans  to  households  in  Sweden  are  such  that  they  justify  further 
measures. 
Housing prices and the households’ debts as a percentage of their disposable incomes rose 
substantially in Sweden from the mid-1990s until the start of the financial crisis. As can be 
seen  in  Figure  8,  real  housing  prices  also  increased  dramatically  in  the  other  Nordic 
countries in this period. However, the situation has been different in recent years. The rate of 
growth in loans to households has fallen significantly and the debt ratio has therefore levelled 
out,  although  at  an  historically  high  level  (see Figure  9).  Increases  in  housing  prices  have 
also been much more subdued in recent years. As in Finland, real housing prices seem to 
                                                 
10  In the United States, the central bank has added liquidity to the markets by purchasing bonds. The central 
banks in the United Kingdom and Japan have also launched extensive asset-purchase programmes. The ECB 
has  offered  loans  to  European  banks  in  the  form  of  three-year  LTRO  loans  (Long-term  Refinancing 
Operations). The ECB has also announced a new support programme, Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) 
which enables unlimited purchases of government bonds in countries that apply for emergency loans and thus 
accept the conditions for such loans. 
11  In  the  Monetary  Policy  Report  published  in  July  2012,  the  Riksbank’s  assessment  was  that  the  long-run 
sustainable unemployment rate is in the interval 5–7.5 per cent. The mid-point of the estimated interval is thus 
6.25  per  cent.  There  are  also  other  estimates  of  the  long-run  sustainable  unemployment  rate.  In  the  latest 
issue of its report “Wage Formation in Sweden”, the National Institute of Economic Research assesses this 
rate to be around 7 per cent at present, but that it will fall to around 6 per cent in the years immediately ahead 
(see Wage Formation in Sweden 2012, National Institute of Economic Research). According to a calculation 
by  Lars  Svensson  of  how  the  deviation  between  the  actual  inflation  rate  and  the  inflation  target  affects 
unemployment, the mid-point of the Riksbank’s estimated interval is at 5.5 per cent (see “Correction of the 
Riksbank’s  estimate  of  the  long-run  sustainable  unemployment  rate”,  Appendix  2,  minutes  of  the  monetary 
policy meeting, July 2012).

and in Denmark, where there has been a significant fall in prices.

Developments  on  the  Swedish  housing  market  thus  appear  to  be  much  calmer  now  than 
before the financial crisis. However, it is of course important to constantly analyse whether 
developments  can  pose  risks  to  financial  or  macroeconomic  stability.  The  development  of 
household  indebtedness  could  lead  to  problems  if  housing  prices  began  to  fall  for  some 
reason or if unemployment began to increase sharply in connection with a downturn. In order 
to assess to what extent this constitutes a risk we need to analyse the risk of a fall in housing 
prices and the extent to which the level of debt makes the households vulnerable. In the case 
of the latter, it is important to determine what assets the households have in addition to their 
housing. The relatively high level of private saving in Sweden is an advantage here as it has 
led  to  a  situation  in  which  the  households  have  relatively  substantial  financial  assets  (see 
Figure 9).  
Analysing the risk of a fall in housing prices is not easy, but a natural starting point is to try to 
find good indicators of such price falls based on the experience gained in other countries. 
According  to  a  study  by  the  IMF,  the  likelihood  of  a  fall  in  housing  prices  increases  if  the 
growth of loans as a percentage of GDP is high, the current account is in deficit and housing 
investments are high in relation to GDP.12 Put simply, one can say that the risk of a fall in 
housing prices is high in economies where there is a loan-financed building boom and where 
the loans are largely backed by funding abroad rather than by domestic saving. 
Credit growth has indeed been relatively high in Sweden for a number of years, so on the 
basis of just this indicator there is some reason to believe that there is an increased risk of a 
fall in housing prices. However, the situation with regard to the current account and housing 
investment  has  rather been  the  opposite  of  that  associated  with  an increased  risk  of  such 
price falls. As I mentioned earlier, Sweden has a substantial surplus on its current account 
and this has now been the case for many years. Figure 4 also illustrated developments in a 
number of countries where housing prices have fallen, such as Ireland, Spain and the United 
States, and we can see that the current account deficits have been relatively substantial in all 
of  these  countries.  One  explanation  of  the  relatively  low  level  of  overall  investment  in 
Sweden,  which  is  one  of  the  factors  behind  the  current  account  surplus,  is  in  fact  the  low 
level of investment in housing (see Figure 10). There are thus no signs that the credit growth 
we have experienced has financed a building boom or that it is associated with a low level of 
domestic saving. 
In recent years, the number of new-builds in the housing sector in Sweden has been around 
20 000  per  year,  which  a  low  figure  in  historical  terms.13  The  low  level  of  new  housing 
construction is thus an important factor behind rising house prices.14 
                                                 
12  When all of these three factors deviated significantly from their normal patterns at the same time, there was a 
56  per  cent  probability  of  a  substantial  fall  in  housing  prices.  See  IMF  (2009),  World  Economic  Outlook, 
October. 
13  This is a level that over the last 50 years has only been lower for a few  years during the 1990s (Statistics 
Sweden, 2012 “Housing construction low for a long time”, SCB Economic Indicator, no. 2012:92). 
14  Peter Englund, among others, points to the low level of housing construction in Sweden as one of the reasons 
for  the  sharp  increase  in  prices;  see  Englund,  Peter  (2011),  “Swedish  house  prices  in  an  international 
perspective”, Chapter I.1 in The Riksbank’s inquiry into risks in the Swedish housing market.

Other indicators of falls in housing prices have also been proposed, for example the positive 
deviation  of  housing  prices  from  a  long-term  trend,  which  at  present  is  relatively  high  in 
Sweden.15 However, the point is that the picture provided by the typical indicators of a fall in 
housing prices is mixed for Sweden. Some appear to be alarming while others are practically 
the  opposite  of  what  is  typically  the  case  before  a  fall  in  housing  prices.  This  does  not  of 
course mean that we can be certain that prices will not fall, but it is still important to have this 
background clear in order to be able to assess the risks on the housing market. 
If  developments  in  the  period  ahead  are  such  that  it  seems  justified  to  take  measures  to 
dampen housing prices and household indebtedness, I am nevertheless doubtful about using 
the repo rate to do this. It would be better to reduce the level of the loan-to-value ceiling that 
Finansinspektionen recommends the banks to stay below, or to raise the banks’ risk weights 
for  mortgages.16  Another  alternative  would  be  to  reduce  the  tax  deductions  for  interest 
payments  somewhat.  Unlike  repo-rate  increases,  these  measures  are  aimed  directly  at 
mortgages. These are of course measures that do not lie within the Riksbank’s mandate, but 
it  is  in  everyone’s  interest  to  ensure  that  the  risks  associated  with  the  Swedish  housing 
market are managed effectively. 
So  why  am  I  against  using  the  repo  rate  to  influence  housing  prices  and  household 
indebtedness? The main reason is that the costs – in the form of inflation below the target 
                                                 
15  For example, Borio and Drehmann (2009) present an indicator of financial crisis based on trend deviations for 
private loans as a percentage of GDP and property prices in the paper “Assessing the risk of banking crises – 
revisited”.  The  latter  components  are  intended  to  capture  the  likelihood  and  magnitude  of  a  fall  in  property 
prices. 
16  Finansinspektionen  has  recently  proposed  a  floor  of  15  per  cent  for  risk  weights  for  mortgages.  This  floor 
could be raised if there seems to be a need to dampen the banks’ lending for housing purposes.

and unemployment – appear to be high in relation to rather uncertain gains. Most analyses 
indicate  that  the  policy  rate  has  very  little  impact  on  housing  prices  and  thus  also  on 
household indebtedness.17 Using the repo rate would be justified if what we were seeing was 
a  credit  boom  throughout  the  Swedish  economy.  But  this  is  not  what  we  are  seeing. 
Household  indebtedness  is  increasing  at  approximately  the  same  rate  as  disposable 
incomes. The rate of growth in bank lending to companies typically varies with the business 
cycle, and at present this rate is low (see Figure 11). All in all, credit growth is relatively low 
in the Swedish economy.

 Another problem with using monetary policy to influence household indebtedness is that this 
also has an impact on the exchange rate. All else being equal, higher interest rates lead to a 
stronger currency and, again all else being equal, a stronger currency leads to lower inflation 
and lower resource utilisation. 
There are thus clear costs associated with using monetary policy in this way. The alternative 
–  and  a  better  one  –  is  to  separate  monetary  policy  from  the  policy  that  aims  to  promote 
financial  stability.  This  could  be  done  by  establishing  an  effective 
for 
macroprudential policy that is a policy that aims to counteract risks in the financial system as 
a whole.

for  cooperation  on  macroprudential  policy  between 
A separate macroprudential policy 
In January 2013, the Financial Crisis Commission presented an interim report that discusses, 
among  other  things,  how  financial  crises  can  be  prevented  in  Sweden.  The  Commission 
proposes the setting up of a council for macroprudential policy. This would entail the existing 
council 
the  Riksbank  and 
Finansinspektionen being established by law and complemented by independent experts and 
an  observer  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  council  should  also  work  to  develop 
macroprudential  policy  instruments,  analyse  risks  and  discuss  appropriate  measures.  The 
intention is that responsibility for deciding whether or not to apply a macroprudential policy 
instrument would lie with either Finansinspektionen or the Riksbank. 
The  Commission’s  proposal  is  well-reasoned  and  wise,  but,  as  I see  it,  has  one  flaw:  it  is 
unclear who is ultimately responsible for conducting macroprudential policy. As it will usually 
be a question of taking measures that are unpopular – for example limiting the possibilities of 
households to borrow money in a way that will restrict their choices about where they can 
live,  or  limiting  the  possibilities  of  financial  companies  to  earn  money  –  it  is  vital  that 
someone is made responsible for ensuring that the measures are actually taken. This may 
well be, as the Commission suggests, the Riksbank or Finansinspektionen. However, I am 
sceptical about both authorities being responsible, as it will be all too easy to blame each 
other when a crisis actually develops.18  
It  is  of  course  natural  for  the  Riksbank  to  play  a  central  role  in  macroprudential policy,  as 
financial stability is a precondition for macroeconomic stability and risks to financial stability 
are therefore analysed on an ongoing basis.19 However, a responsibility for macroprudential 
policy may potentially come into conflict with the independence the Riksbank has in the field 
of  monetary  policy.  This  is  an  independence  based  on  the  realisation  that  a  politically-
governed monetary policy tends to be inflationary, as it may be tempting for political reasons 
to renege on a promise of low inflation and to conduct a more inflationary monetary policy 
that reduces unemployment in the short-term.20 However, independence goes hand in hand 
with  a  clearly-defined  objective  for  monetary  policy  that  can  be  constantly  evaluated. 
Macroprudential  policy  is  different  in  nature,  as  the  objective  is  to  prevent  crises.  It  is  of 
course possible to constantly register whether a crisis has occurred or not, but if a crisis has 
not occurred it is difficult to determine whether the measures taken have been well-designed 
or not. As it is a case of unpopular measures, one might think that it would be an advantage 
if the decisions were made by people who in practice cannot be dismissed. But this this may 
not be a particularly good solution from a democratic point of view. 
At the same time, macroprudential policy may address the issue of macroeconomic stability 
in such a way that it comes close to what monetary policy aims to achieve. The historically-
high level of household indebtedness in Sweden does not perhaps in the first instance pose 
a  risk  of  financial  crisis  but  to  macroeconomic  development  in  the  longer  term.  A  fall  in 
housing  prices  in  connection  with  an  economic  slowdown  with  increased  unemployment 
could  lead  to  a  severe  downturn  if  the  households  reacted  by  significantly  increasing  their 
saving to compensate for declining wealth.21 This risk relates to financial and macroeconomic 
                                                 
18  Similar  criticism  was  expressed  by  my  colleague  Kerstin  af  Jochnick  in  the  speech  “Monetary  policy  and 
macroprudential policy”, 25 January 2013. 
19  The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) highlights the role of the central bank in its recommendations on 
institutional  frameworks  for  national  macroprudential  policy  (see  the  Recommendation  of  the  European 
Systemic Risk Board of 22 December 2011 on the macroprudential mandate of national authorities).

imbalances rather than to financial stability. They are also imbalances that must be viewed in 
a much longer perspective than the perspective we usually adopt when we make decisions 
about the repo rate. 
Financial and macroeconomic imbalances of this type can of course result in financial crises, 
but  do  not  do  so  automatically.  We  should  therefore  distinguish  between  avoiding  such 
imbalances and avoiding crises than threaten the financial system. In both cases I believe 
that  we  need  an  active  policy  alongside  the  standard  stabilisation  policy.  I  am  sure  that 
everyone agrees that the Riksbank has a central role to play in analysing the emergence of 
financial and macroeconomic imbalances. However, what the role of the Riksbank should be 
when  it  comes  to  deciding  on  measures  to  counteract  imbalances  in  the  longer  term  is  a 
more open question at present. In my view, it is important that macroprudential policy is put 
in place as a separate policy area. This would be good for financial stability, but also good for 
macroeconomic stabilisation. The proposal of the Financial Crisis Commission has now been 
circulated for comment and I and the other members of the Executive Board of the Riksbank 
will now formulate our joint response to the proposal during the spring. 
Conclusions 
I  thus  believe  that  there  are  many  indications  that  demand  is  too  weak  in  the  Swedish 
economy and that in principle this has been the case ever since the autumn of 2008. One 
should  not  have  exaggerated  expectations  of  what  monetary  policy  can  achieve  when  it 
comes to reducing the relatively high level of unemployment in Sweden. However, as long as 
inflation is expected to be clearly under the target of 2 per cent I believe there is scope to use 
monetary policy to try to alleviate the situation on the labour market. 
I have argued that one of the reasons why fiscal policy and monetary policy have not been 
used  more  actively  to  increase  demand  in  the  Swedish  economy  is  the  concern  about 
financial stability. The risk that public finances will be radically weakened if the government is 
forced to intervene to support banks in crisis seems to be an argument for being cautious 
with  public  finances  at  present.  The  risk  that  low  interest  rates  will  increase  household 
indebtedness  and  that  this  in  turn  will  increase  the  vulnerability  of  the  households  if,  for 
example, housing prices fall for some reason has been put forward as an argument against 
lowering the repo rate.22 Personally, I do not believe that the latter risk is particularly serious 
at present as the rate of increase in lending to households has declined significantly since 
before the financial crisis. Nevertheless, it is a risk that is taken into account in the monetary 
policy  decisions.  All  in  all,  therefore,  economic  policy  has  not  sufficiently  counteracted  the 
effects of weak development abroad and pessimistic households and companies. 
How can we establish an effective policy for business cycle stabilisation in Sweden without at 
the same time exposing the economy to considerable risks with regard to financial stability? 
One  important  step  is  to  establish  a  separate  policy  area  with  explicit  responsibility  for 
preventing financial crises. If we succeed in creating an effective framework for such a policy 
area,  monetary  policy  would  be  better  able  to  focus  on  its  main  tasks:  stabilising  inflation 
around  the  inflation  target  and  resource  utilisation  around  a  sustainable  level.  The  interim 
report  of  the  Financial  Crisis  Commission,  with  its  proposal  to  set  up  a  council  for 
macroprudential policy, is welcome in this context. However, as I have pointed out earlier, 
the division of responsibility is not set out very clearly in this proposal and it is unclear which 
authority should do what. For me it is not important that it is the Riksbank, rather than any 
other  authority,

macroprudential policy. But it is important that someone is given responsibility, otherwise we 
will have created a framework that is no clearer than the one we have today. Exactly how 
responsibility should be allocated is an issue that I am not prepared to discuss further today. 
It  is  an  issue  that  will  have  to  wait  until  the  Riksbank  submits  its  response  to  the  interim 
report of the Financial Crisis Commission later in the spring.
