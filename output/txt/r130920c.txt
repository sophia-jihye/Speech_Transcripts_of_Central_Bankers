Cecilia Skingsley: Reasonable expectations of monetary policy 
Speech  by  Ms  Cecilia  Skingsley,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  Danske 
Bank, Stockholm, 19 September 2013. 
 This is not the first time I will present my view of monetary policy in Sweden. I have done so 
in many different contexts during my 20 years as a professional economist, for instance as a 
columnist  for  “Dagens  Industri”  or,  most  recently,  as  Chief  Economist  at  Swedbank.  Now, 
however, I am here as one of the new members of the Executive Board of the Riksbank. It is 
of  course  quite  a  different  thing  to  be  one  of  the  six  people  responsible  for  the  monetary 
policy  decisions  than  to  be  an  external  analyst.  It  is  of  course  also  the  case  that  the 
experience I have gained marks my monetary policy stance and colours my view of what it is 
reasonable to expect of monetary policy in practice. Today I intend to talk about my thinking 
at  the  two  latest  monetary  policy  meetings  and  about  my  thinking  on  monetary  policy  in 
principle. 
Monetary policy through my eyes 
It  is  now  two  weeks  or  so  since  I  took  part  in  my  second  monetary  policy  meeting  as  a 
member  of  the  Executive  Board.  The  situation  prior  to  the  meetings  in  both  July  and 
September was marked by a low rate of inflation, for example CPIF inflation has been below 
two per cent since 2011, and a level of resource utilisation in the economy that was deemed 
to be lower than normal. 
The  forecasts  in  July  and  September  were  that  inflation  was  expected  to  rise  towards 
two per cent in 2015 and that resource utilisation was expected to increase as growth picked 
up. The  assessment  was  that the  expansionary  monetary  policy  would  contribute  to  this. I 
personally voted to keep the repo rate at the historically-low level of one per cent at both the 
July and September meetings.

What were the trade-offs behind my decisions? On the one hand an even  lower repo-rate 
path  could,  according  to  the  Riksbank’s  calculations,  lead  to  inflation  reaching  the  target 
somewhat sooner and to resource utilisation improving somewhat faster, while on the other 
hand  there  were  other  circumstances  to  take  into  account  that  made  the  decisions  more 
complicated. For example, there is always uncertainty about exactly how monetary policy will 
affect the economy during the forecast period. When analysing the state of the economy I 
have focused on understanding how much can be attributed to cyclical fluctuations and how 
much to structural factors. In practice it is of course difficult to precisely distinguish between 
structural  and  cyclical  factors,  but  it  is  nevertheless  important  to  analyse  this  as  monetary 
policy  can  only  affect  the  latter.  I  have  also  asked  myself  what  the  relatively  strong 
development  of  the  Swedish  household  sector  in  relation  to  the  weaker  situation  in  the 
industrial sector means for monetary policy. All in all, I thought it was reasonable to leave the 
repo rate unchanged, for two main reasons. First, I think it would be wrong to lower the repo 
rate further in a situation in which the economy is improving. Second, I believe that a lower 
repo  rate  today  could  increase  the  risks  associated  with  household  indebtedness  in  the 
longer term. 
I will now explain my thinking about monetary policy today in more detail and describe how I 
see  the  current  situation  in  the  Swedish  economy,  what  I  believe  monetary  policy  can 
achieve and how I see the situation in the period ahead. 
Divided demand – the explanation is to be found abroad 
I  would  like  to  begin  by  looking  back  in  order  to  describe  my  view  of  the  situation  today. 
Approximately five years have passed since the financial crisis began in earnest and these 
have  been  turbulent  years  for  the  global  economy.  Sweden  is  highly  affected  by  what 
happens abroad but we have coped much better than many other countries, partly because 
we  have  not  been  hit  by  problems  resulting  from  an  excessive  level  of  debt  in  either  the 
public or the private sectors.

After  the  sharp  downturn  in  2008–2009,  Swedish  GDP  growth  initially  recovered  quite 
quickly.  Unfortunately,  the  improvement  in  the  rate  of  growth  stopped  short  when  the 
financial  crisis  developed  into  a  debt  crisis  in  Europe,  and  this  has  restricted  Swedish 
exports. This has happened directly, as the euro area is Sweden’s largest export market, and 
indirectly, as the euro area affects industrial activity in other parts of Europe and Asia that in 
turn are important growth markets for the Swedish manufacturing industry. 
However,  while  indicators  have  long shown  that  the manufacturing  industry  is  in  a  weaker 
than  normal  state,  the  financial  situation  of  the  households  has  been  relatively  strong. 
Moreover, if the weak development of exports and investment during, above all, 2012 had 
not been counteracted by household consumption, then the latest slowdown in the Swedish 
economy  would  have  been  more  pronounced.  Households  have  become  more  optimistic 
over the last 12 months and this is reflected in higher housing prices, increased lending and 
increased consumption. They have been helped by the increase in their disposable incomes 
over  a  period  of  several  years.  Low  interest  rates  have  of  course  contributed  to  this 
development in the household sector. 
Turning to the labour market, employment has increased but unemployment is nevertheless 
higher  than  it  was  a  year  ago  as  the  labour  force  has  increased  relatively  quickly.  This  is 
partly  due  to  an  increase  in  those  of  working  age  in  the  population,  but  also  to  the 
government’s  labour-market  reforms,  which  are  both  factors  of  a  structural  nature.  At  the 
moment unemployment is approximately 8 per cent and with the Riksbank’s current forecast 
we are approaching the interval of 5 to 7.5 per cent within which the Riksbank believes the 
long-run sustainable rate of unemployment lies.1 If we look at the situation in different sectors 
we can see that employment has increased in the service sector while the weak demand for 
Swedish industrial products is in part responsible for the weak development of employment 
in the manufacturing industry.

The  relatively  low  level  of  economic  activity  abroad  has  also  affected  inflation  in  Sweden 
more directly. One reason for the low rate of inflation recently is namely that the prices of 
goods  have  increased  slowly.  The  strengthening  of the krona  in recent years  has  led  to  a 
further reduction in import prices. On the other hand, service prices in Sweden have helped 
to keep up the rate of inflation.

 All in all, given the relatively weak development abroad, it is thus not difficult to understand 
the division in demand that has marked the Swedish economy in recent years. 
What can monetary policy do today? 
Swedish  monetary  policy  cannot  do  anything  about  the  causes  of  the  weak  demand  from 
abroad, but it can mitigate the effects on the Swedish economy. How low the repo rate needs 
to  be,  and  how  quickly  inflation  should  rise  towards  the  target  are  ultimately  questions  of 
judgement. I believe that it is appropriate that the Riksbank has let the repo rate remain at 
one per cent since the end of last year in order to boost the Swedish economy and to get 
inflation to rise to 2 per cent. According to the forecast, the repo rate will remain at this level 
until  the  end  of  2014.  In  the  forecast,  the  real  interest  rate  will  remain  negative  until  the 
beginning of 2015, which shows that monetary policy is expansionary. 
Monetary policy can mitigate the effects of weak development abroad 
An even lower repo rate could help inflation to return to the target somewhat more quickly, as 
illustrated  in  a  monetary  policy  scenario  in  the  Monetary  Policy  Report  published  in  July. 
According  to  the  Riksbank’s  model  calculations,  a  further  repo-rate  cut  would  lead  to  a 
further  increase  in  consumption  and  increased  investment.  A  lower  repo  rate  would  also 
weaken  the  exchange  rate,  which  could  benefit  exports  while  at  the  same  time  making 
imports more expensive. All in all, this would lead to higher GDP growth and a higher level of 
resource utilisation, which  would  lead to a higher rate of price increases. According to the 
calculations in the Monetary Policy Report, a 0.25 percentage point lower repo rate for one 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
year would lead CPIF inflation to approach 2 per cent during the first half of 2015, which is 
approximately  six  months  earlier  than  in  the  Riksbank’s main  scenario.2  Thereafter,  in  this 
example, CPIF would be marginally above 2 per cent. 
Looking  at  these  calculations  it  appears  that  a  lower  repo-rate  path  would  be  the  better 
strategy  for  stabilising  CPIF  inflation  and  resource  utilisation.  However,  this  interpretation 
does  not  take  into  account  the fact  that  there  is  uncertainty  about  the  effects  of  monetary 
policy  on  the  economy.  The  quantitative  effects  in  the  scenario  are  estimated  using  the 
Riksbank’s  macro  model  for  the  Swedish  economy,  but  such  estimates  entail  a  degree  of 
uncertainty and other empirical approaches could lead to different results. A common result 
in the research literature is that if we take into account the fact that there is uncertainty about 
the impact of monetary policy then we should act more gradually over time. However, it may 
then take longer for inflation to approach the target and for resource utilisation to normalise 
than if we do not take such uncertainty into account.3 This line of reasoning may therefore 
mean that a higher repo-rate path is better balanced than the example’s lower path, despite 
the fact that it will take longer for inflation to reach the target. Put another way, if we are not 
absolutely certain about the outcome of monetary policy it is better to proceed gradually. 
Moreover, the repo rate is already low at present at the same time as we are seeing more 
and more signs that economic activity is picking up and at the same time as there are risks 
associated with household indebtedness. I would like to begin by discussing why household 
indebtedness has affected my stance on monetary policy. 
Risks and rewards must be weighed against each other 
Asset managers think in terms of risks and rewards. A strategy is evaluated using a financial 
risk calculation that is based on how much an asset portfolio can increase in value in relation 
to the risk that it will fall in value. This approach can also be applied to the world of central 
banking, although instead of being about an asset portfolio it is then about monitoring risks 
relating  to  the  development  of  the  economy  and  to  the  central  bank’s  target  variables,  for 
example  inflation.4  As  in  the  case  of  an  asset  manager,  the  time  horizon  on  which  the 
strategy is based is important. Translated to the current situation in the Swedish economy, 
this risk-reward approach could be expressed by saying that better target attainment in the 
short term must be weighed against increased risks in the longer term. 
In  other  words,  using  a  more  expansionary  policy  to  boost  a  part  of  the  economy  that  is 
already  relatively  strong,  that  is the  households,  to  counteract  weak  demand  in  the  export 
sector – which in the main is due to factors beyond the reach of Swedish monetary policy – 
risks leading to imbalances in the long term in my opinion. Of course it is true that a more 
expansionary  monetary  policy  could  weaken  the  exchange  rate,  which  would  benefit  the 
export sector, but in the monetary policy trade-off I cannot ignore the risks associated with 
the high level of household debt. 
At the same time, there is also a risk that monetary policy itself can contribute to the build-up 
of imbalances in the economy, not only by affecting various players through the well-known 
transmission channels, that is the interest rate channel, the exchange rate channel and the

If the repo rate is set 0.25 percentage points lower for four quarters, CPIF inflation in the example would reach 
1.9 per cent in the first quarter of 2015 and 2.0 per cent in the second quarter of 2015. This can be compared 
to the main scenario from July in which CPIF inflation reaches 1.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, 
1.95 per cent in the third quarter of 2015 and 1.96 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015, but does not reach 
2.0 per cent until 2016. 
3  See,  for  example,  Williams  (2013).  However,  the  insight  that  uncertainty  about  economic  relations  often 
justifies a more cautious policy goes back to Brainard (1967).

credit channel, but also through the risk-taking channel. The risk-taking channel, which was 
analysed in an article in the Riksbank’s own journal, “Sveriges Riksbank Economic Review”, 
last  year,  is  really  a  collective  term  for  several  different  mechanisms  which  mean  that 
monetary policy, by setting low policy rates, can encourage various players in the economy 
to take greater risks.5 The argument is that banks and other financial institutions take greater 
risks when the policy rate is low by increasing their level of debt or changing the maturity of 
their funding. This may be justified from the individual player’s point of view, but poses a risk 
to the economy as a whole. In the light of my experience of the financial market before and 
after the financial crisis, this theory seems intuitively correct. There is also empirical evidence 
to support the hypothesis that low interest rates lead to increased risk taking. It is not certain, 
however, that the change in the players’ risk taking is solely due to monetary policy, it may 
also  stem  from  a  generally  low  level  of  interest  rates  that  has  structural  causes.  This  is  a 
subject that I am sure we will continue to discuss, not least in terms of what it is reasonable 
to expect monetary policy can achieve. 
Monetary policy must take financial stability into account 
The risk-taking channel has been described as a possible link between monetary policy and 
the work to safeguard financial stability. My starting point is that it is reasonable for monetary 
policy  to  take  into  account  factors  that  relate  to  financial  stability.  This  is  partly  because 
financial stability is a necessary condition for an effective monetary policy, but also because 
financial instability risks leading to major fluctuations in both the real economy and inflation. 
We  should  also  take  financial  stability  into  account  because  part  of  the  Riksbank’s 
assignment is to promote a safe and efficient payment system. 
Furthermore,  in  order  to  adapt  monetary  policy  to  the  risk  of  future  crises  in  the  wake  of 
financial imbalances we do not need to know that a crisis will actually occur, or exactly when, 
but  we  do  need  to  know  through  what  mechanisms  or  under  what  circumstances  the 
probability of a crisis increases. Nor is it a case of a crisis being the most likely outcome but 
rather that the risk that something major can happen should make us focus our attention in 
that  direction.6  If  we  learned  anything  from  the  financial  crisis  it  was  that  there  is  every 
reason to take even less likely outcomes into account. The financial crisis has also reminded 
us that cleaning up after a crisis can entail huge costs and take a long time. Five years after 
the financial crisis began, for example, unemployment is still high in many of the countries 
that were hit hardest.7 
With regard to household indebtedness it is obviously the case that monetary policy cannot 
do much about a high level of debt that in turn is due to high housing prices if these have 
structural causes, such as insufficient new construction, tax regulations, building regulations 
and so on. However, the repo rate nevertheless has an impact on the situation of households 
that purchase housing. Experience from other countries shows that a high level of debt can 
pose risks to the economy, and the level of household debt in Sweden is now high in both 
historical and international terms.

An  article  in  the  Monetary  Policy  Report  published  in  July  analyses  the  potential 
consequences of this.8 One risk in this connection is that the major Swedish banks largely 
fund their operations on the international capital markets and the level of confidence in the 
banks  is  decisive  for  their  ability  to  get  funding.  A  future  economic  downturn  with  a  fall  in 
housing  prices  in  Sweden  could  therefore  in  the  worst  case  be  aggravated  if  international 
investors chose to reduce their exposure to the Swedish banking sector. The IMF recently 
repeated  its  warning  about  the  high  level  of  household  debt  in  Sweden  and  the  relatively 
large  and  concentrated  banking  sector  and  called  for  the  quick  implementation  of  the 
macroprudential policy instruments.9

clarifying the framework for financial stability. 
Macroprudential  policy  should  also  be  able  to  use  special  instruments  to  manage 
developments in that part of the economy where there is a risk of imbalances. More specific 
instruments, such as amortisation requirements and higher risk weights for mortgages, are 
also probably more precise in their effects than the repo rate when the aim is to prevent and 
the  Riksbank  should  openly  present

manage  the  risks  associated  with  household  indebtedness.  A  mortgage  cap  is  already  in 
place. But we still do not know exactly what form future instruments will take and when it will 
be possible to begin using them. Once they are in place, however, I hope that there will be 
less need to take household indebtedness into account in the decisions on the repo rate. 
The current discussion on the division of responsibility for macroprudential policy also calls to 
mind  the  relationship  between  monetary  policy  and  fiscal  policy.  Through  the  medium  of 
monetary  policy,  the  Riksbank  can  influence  the  development  of  the  real  economy  and 
thereby  the  loan  losses  of  the  financial  institutions,  the  profitability  of  the  companies  and 
assets  prices  on  the  financial  markets.  All  this  in  turn  affects  financial  stability.  And  a 
macroprudential  policy  that  aims  to  promote  financial  stability  and  comprises  risk  weights, 
capital  requirements  and  amortisation  requirements  will  affect  interest-rate  margins  and 
interest-rate differentials which in turn will have an impact on the transmission mechanism of 
monetary policy. When the new framework for macroprudential policy is eventually in place 
and  in  use,  the  Riksbank  will  need  to  consider  how  it  believes  macroprudential  policy 
measures will affect the development of the economy and financial stability in its forecasting 
work. The Riksbank should be able to take into account the effects of the macroprudential 
policy  instruments  in  roughly  the  same  way  as  it  now  takes  into  account  how  the 
government’s future budget plans will affect the economy. 
Gradual improvement in economic activity, but uncertainty remains 
I began this speech by looking back at the economic situation over the last few years. I would 
now like to spend the rest of my time looking forward. My second argument for leaving the 
repo  rate  unchanged  at  1  per  cent  in  July  and  September  was  namely  that  the  economy 
seems  to  be  taking  a  turn  for  the  better.  A  gradual  improvement  in  economic  activity  was 
indeed in line with the Riksbank’s earlier forecast, but ahead of the September meeting we 
had received additional statistics and other information that supported this assessment. For 
example, confidence indicators for Sweden and abroad had improved. Share indexes on the 
financial  markets  had  risen  thanks  to  positive  signals  about  the  recovery  of  the  global 
economy.  The  outlook  for  a  continued  recovery  in  the  United  States  was  good  and  there 
were signs that an improvement had begun in the euro area. 
Economic activity improving 
When it comes to the prospects for higher demand from the euro countries following the debt 
crisis and all the structural problems, I have become gradually less pessimistic over the last 
12  months.  This  is  for  example  because  several  highly-indebted  countries  have  made 
progress  in  reducing  their  budget  deficits.  The  Swedish  crisis  of  the  1990s  made  a  great 
impression on me as an economist and my experience from that period tells me that when 
households  and  companies  see  that  the  worst  problems  are  over  and  that  the  situation  is 
being managed then there is potential for increased confidence about the future, which we 
have also seen in recent months. This is despite the fact that unemployment is still high and 
that  the  recovery  of  economic  activity  in  these  countries  is  starting  from  a  low  level.  Of 
course a lot remains to be done and here the responsibility primarily lies with the politicians 
in the respective countries. 
The euro area’s common monetary policy is an important tool for easing the readjustment, 
but it cannot correct all the causes of the crisis. This requires decisions at the national level 
in order to come to terms with weak public finances and to change economic and political 
structures so that competitiveness is improved. It has long been the Riksbank’s assessment 
that  the  crisis  can  be  resolved  in  an  orderly  way  and  that  economic  growth  will  gradually 
improve. This assessment still applies, and it is gratifying that recent events have confirmed 
an improvement, although forecasts of the future of course remain uncertain.

 Uncertainty remains 
However,  apart  from  uncertainty  regarding  developments  in  the  euro  area  there  are,  to 
paraphrase  Donald  Rumsfeld,  the  former  Secretary  of  Defence  of  the  United  States,  also 
other “known unknowns” that may affect the short-term prospects. One example of this is if 
there  is  a  tangible  change  in  market  expectations  regarding  monetary  policy  in  the  United 
States. Ahead of yesterday’s meeting of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, long-term 
interest rates had risen in the United States and Europe, partly due to expectations that the 
Federal  Reserve  would  reduce  its  asset  purchases  and  partly  due  to  the  more  positive 
signals about the performance of the economy. Share prices have risen in parallel with the 
rise  in  interest  rates.  However,  a  side  effect  of  the  better  growth  prospects  and  the 
expectations  of  a  less  expansionary  monetary  policy  in  the  United  States  has  been  that 
several emerging economies have been hit by capital outflows. 
In the slightly longer term, questions also remain about the outlook for global trade at large, a 
factor  that  has  a  substantial  impact  on  an  export-dependent  country  such  as  Sweden. 
According to some analysts, the development of global trade is now weaker than implied by 
historical  links  with  global  growth.10  If  this  is  the  case,  is  it  because  companies  have  less 
access  to  trade  credits  in  the  wake  of  the  financial  crisis  or  because  there  has  been  a 
structural shift in the growth curve for global trade? It is perhaps not reasonable to expect the 
high  rates  of  growth  that  we  saw  in  the  early  2000s  –  and  which  were  boosted  by 
globalisation  in  the  wake  of  technological  development,  lower  transports  costs,  increased 
specialisation, China joining the WTO and so on – to continue. It is also important to monitor 
how Swedish exports develop in relation to global trade. These are complex questions that it 
is probably too soon to answer. However, there is every reason to return to these questions 
too,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  potential  consequences  for  Sweden.  All  in  all,  the 
Riksbank’s  assessment  from  the  September  Monetary  Policy  Update  is  nevertheless  that

economic  activity  abroad  will,  if  only  gradually,  make  a  positive  contribution  to  Swedish 
growth.

Manufacturing industry catching up 
It is probable that we will be able to continue to describe the Swedish economy as divided for 
a  while  longer,  even  though  confidence  indicators  suggest  that  the  situation  in  the 
manufacturing industry is returning to normal. However, given the prospects for higher global 
demand  we  should  also  expect  Swedish  exports  to  increase  in  the  years  ahead.  In 
combination  with  a  more  expansionary  fiscal  policy  in  Sweden  and  a  low  repo  rate,  GDP 
growth  can  thus  be  expected  to  pick  up  and  the  current  low  rate  of  CPIF  inflation  can  be 
expected to gradually increase. 
Some new statistics have been published since the monetary policy meeting in September 
that  shed  light  on  the  current  situation  in  the  Swedish  economy.  CPIF  inflation  was 
1.2 per cent in August, which was somewhat higher than expected. A revised version of the 
National Accounts has also been published which shows that GDP fell slightly more in the 
second quarter than indicated by the figures published earlier. The growth figures have also 
been revised down somewhat for 2011 and up somewhat for 2012. In addition, new labour 
market  statistics  show  that  seasonally-adjusted  unemployment  amounted  to  8 per cent  in 
August.  The  next  Monetary  Policy  Report  will  not  be  published  for  a  while  yet,  but  at  the 
Riksbank we are already working with new analyses and forecasts. Ahead of the monetary 
policy  meeting  on  23  October  I  will  weigh  these  factors  against  each  other,  but  also  take 
account of any additional information that becomes available before then in order to arrive at 
a new assessment.

 Good development in the short term, sustainable in the long term 
I hope that in my speech today I have been able to convey my thinking on monetary policy at 
the two latest monetary policy meetings and how I view the current situation. 
The  repo  rate  is  low  at  present.  The  Riksbank’s  forecasts  show  that  inflation  will  reach 
2 per cent  within  the  forecast  period  at  the  same  time  as  resource  utilisation  will  improve. 
Although the global economy is weak at the moment, the preconditions for a recovery are in 
place. Sweden is in a better position than many other countries, but there is work to be done 
to  put  an  effective  structure  for  macroprudential  policy  in  place.  Once  this  structure  is  in 
place, we will be more able to manage the risks associated with the high level of household 
debt. Monetary policy could of course be somewhat more expansionary in the short term but 
we must remember that monetary policy is not perfectly precise and we must have realistic 
expectations  of  what  it  can  achieve  in  relation  to  the  risks  that  exist.  As  I  see  it  we  are 
already at full stretch as far as household indebtedness is concerned. A continued low repo 
rate offers the possibility of good economic development in the short term and sustainable 
development in the long term.
