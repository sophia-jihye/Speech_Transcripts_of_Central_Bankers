Per Jansson: How do we stop the trend in household debt? Work on 
several fronts 
Speech  by  Mr  Per  Jansson,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  the  SvD  Bank 
Summit, Stockholm, 3 December 2013. 
 Accompanying figures can be found at the end of the speech. 
The original idea of the organisers was that I would talk about the current situation from a 
monetary policy perspective. However, wanting to focus instead on questions of principle, I 
was  able  to  persuade  them  to  let  me  do  so.  Now,  it  may  not  make  much  difference  in 
practice, as the current monetary policy debate in Sweden so largely concerns questions of 
principle. 
I  intend  to  start  by  looking  back  at  how  the  Swedish  economy  has  developed  since  the 
financial  crisis  broke  out  around  five  years  ago,  as  well  as  at  the  debate  about  monetary 
policy during this period. I will then look ahead and give my views on the new policy area, 
macroprudential policy, and what I believe we need to do to escape the situation that has 
arisen  with  a  high  and  increasing  level  of  debt  in  the  household  sector  and  a  persistent 
upward trend in housing prices.  
The conclusions we draw from looking back are  important, as they may affect our view of 
what  is  the  appropriate  future  course  of  action.  If,  for  instance,  the  perception  is  that 
monetary policy has been conducted in the wrong way and led to a poor economic outcome, 
this will in my view make it more difficult to deal effectively with the risks linked to household 
debt when looking ahead. The reason for this is that I believe that monetary policy must play 
at least some role in this context. 
A fairly good development since the crisis 
So, how has the Swedish economy actually developed since the financial crisis broke out just 
over five years ago? The current debate gives rather mixed impressions, ranging from things 
having gone quite well to things having gone rather badly.  
If we look at the data, however, there is no doubt that Sweden has had a relatively good real 
economic  development.  We  compare  favourably  to  the  countries  we  usually  use  as 
benchmarks (see Figure 1). Sweden is one of the relatively few countries where GDP per 
capita is higher now than it was prior to the crisis. The employment rate – the percentage of 
the working-age population in employment – has also held up well. Only few countries have 
had a better development with regard to both GDP and employment (that is, lying above and 
to the right of Sweden in Figure 1).  
Some stress that the development of unemployment has been less favourable. But here we 
must take into account that the labour force in Sweden has increased relatively substantially 
during  the  period  (see  Figure  2).  Even  if  this  has  a  negative  effect  on  the  unemployment 
figures in the short run, it is essentially positive and bodes for a future fall in unemployment.  
Countries  with  a  floating  exchange  rate  appear  on  the  whole  to  have  managed  better. 
However,  I  would  of  course  prefer  to  believe  that  the  relatively  favourable  economic 
development has been due not only to the choice of exchange rate regime, but also at least 
partly to the economic policy we have conducted. 
Expansionary monetary policy, but with an eye on debt 
During the financial crisis, the Riksbank cut the repo rate rapidly and substantially. After the 
crisis we have continued to hold the repo rate low to support the recovery. But as we have 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

made  the  assessment  that  if  the  repo  rate  is  too  low  it  will  entail  a  risk  of  exaggerated 
household  debt  and  inflated  housing  prices,  monetary  policy  has  not  been  quite  as 
expansionary  as  it  might  otherwise  have  been.  We  have  thus  held  the  repo  rate  slightly 
higher  than  we  would  have  done  otherwise,  and  have,  so  to  speak,  stepped  on  the 
accelerator just enough during the recovery phase to ensure that developments are not just 
reasonable in the short term, but also sustainable in the longer run.1 
As  I  see  it,  there  have  been  good  reasons  for  this.  Another  distinguishing  feature  of  the 
countries up on the right of Figure 1 is that they have not yet experienced any major fall in 
their housing market with an ensuing fall in aggregate demand. This is something that has 
happened  in  most  of  the  countries  down  on  the  left  of  the  figure.  One  could  say  that  the 
countries  that  have  managed  well  so  far  have  felt  the  effects  of  the  crisis  through  weaker 
development  abroad,  but  have  managed  to  avoid  major  problems  in  their  own  credit  and 
housing markets. However, not surprisingly, the risks linked to developments in household 
debt  and  the  housing  market  are  currently  high  up  on  the  policy  agenda  in  several  of  the 
countries that have managed well so far, in the same way that they are here in Sweden. 
Repo rate only marginally higher 
One thing that is worth emphasising is that when I say that the repo rate has been a little 
higher than it would otherwise have been, I do mean a little higher. It has not been a case of 
the  Riksbank  using  high  interest  rates  to  stop  an  upturn  in  lending  and  housing  prices  by 
depressing  the  whole  economy.  In  that  case,  we  would  have  had  a  much  poorer 
development than is indicated in Figures 1 and 2. When it comes down to it, the repo rate 
has not been higher than 1 per cent for around one year now. Sometimes it is claimed that 
even this is a high level. But usually one is then comparing it to countries that have been hit 
harder  by  the  crisis,  such  as  the  United  States  and  the  United  Kingdom,  where  housing 
prices have already fallen substantially and one therefore does not need to worry so much 
about a continued upturn from an already high level. Moreover, the relationship between the 
policy  rate  and  credit  growth,  which  is  of  course  important  in  this  context,  is  not 
straightforward. Figure 3 shows, for instance, that credit growth in Sweden is higher than in 
the euro area, despite the Riksbank’s policy rate being higher than the ECB’s. 
The  Riksbank’s  strategy  has  been  to  combine  a  marginally  higher  repo  rate  with 
communication that emphasises that we find the development of high credit growth worrying. 
The slightly higher interest rate does have some effect in itself, but perhaps its main function 
is as a concrete “reminder” of the risks, making it an important part of the communication. 
One may of course discuss how effective this type of policy is. However, I am fairly certain 
that,  combined  with  the  measures  taken  by  Finansinspektionen  (the  Swedish  Financial 
Supervisory  Authority),  it  has  had  at  least  some  effect  in  the  desired  direction  –  that  both 
indebtedness and housing prices in recent years would otherwise have increased more and 
faster  than  they  actually  have  done.  I  am  even  more  convinced  that  the  policy  and  the 
communication surrounding it have helped increase awareness of the problems. My view is 
that the risks linked to developments in the credit and housing markets have been given an 
increasing  amount  of  attention  in  the  media  and  in  the  general  economic  debate  recently, 
which appears to be confirmed in Figure 4. 
Despite the relatively good developments in Sweden in recent years, and the fact that the 
repo  rate  is  still  low,  the  policy  conducted  by  the  Riksbank  has  given  rise  to  considerable 
debate. Some arguments in this debate have been understandable and natural. The size of 
the risks linked to household debt and developments in the housing market is, for instance, 
one question that certainly can and should be discussed. This is something that is inherently 
                                                 
1   This was something that also affected policy to some extent before the crisis, see for instance Nyberg (2005), 
Ingves (2007) and Heikensten (2008).

difficult to quantify and the analysis and discussion of this topic needs to continue. Here I can 
fully  understand  that  the  assessments  may  differ  –  which  has  also  been  the  case  in  the 
Riksbank’s Executive Board. 
A crisis rate for four years is no realistic comparison 
However, there have been elements in the debate that I, at least, have found more difficult to 
understand.  One  such  argument  has  been  that  one  can  basically  disregard  these  risks 
altogether and that the repo rate therefore did not need to be raised at all after the crisis. 
Instead, it is claimed, it should have remained until now – and probably even longer – at the 
0.25  per  cent  to  which  it  was  cut  in  July  2009.  This  assumption  has  then  been  used  to 
calculate how much lower unemployment might have been if the Riksbank had not raised the 
repo rate.2  
Of  course,  we  can  never  know  for  certain  what  would  have  happened  if  we  had  acted 
differently. But what this argument appears to disregard is that when the Riksbank began to 
raise the repo rate in the middle of 2010, the situation was such that the Swedish economy 
had  recovered  surprisingly  quickly  from  the  crisis  (see  Figure  5).  Growth  was  very  fast, 
around 6 per cent for the first quarter when calculated as an annual rate, with a final outcome 
of more than 6 per cent for the year as a whole. Almost all indicators of economic activity 
were pointing upwards and the inflation rate was almost 2 per cent, in terms of the CPIF. The 
traditional reasons alone, without taking into account risks linked to household debt, gave a 
strong  indication  that  it  was  time  to  begin  increasing  the  repo  rate.  In  addition,  although 
lending to households had declined from double digits prior to the crisis, it was still increasing 
by 9 per cent, which was much faster than disposable incomes. 
It would have sent rather strange signals if the Riksbank had in this situation declared that 
the  repo  rate  would  not  be  raised,  but  would  remain  at  0.25  per  cent  for  several  years  to 
come. Apparently, despite the fact that Sweden recovered from the crisis fairly quickly, the 
repo rate should have been held at a crisis level. But even today, with the increases made 
since  the  crisis,  there  are  some  signs  that  households’  repo-rate  expectations  are  below 
what can be considered a reasonable long-run level for mortgage rates (see Figure 6). The 
situation  had  certainly  been  much  worse  if  the  Riksbank  had  held  on  to  a  repo  rate  of 
0.25 per  cent  for  more  than  four  years.  I  believe  that  it  would  have  been  very  difficult  to 
manage the expectations this would have created among households and on the credit and 
housing markets. In my world, such a policy is simply not realistic and must be disregarded 
as a meaningful comparison. It is therefore rather unfortunate, and somewhat surprising, that 
calculations of the number of “lost jobs” based on this assumption have had a relatively large 
impact  on  the  debate.3  As  far  as  I  know,  in  the  countries  in  similar  situation  to  ours  with 
regard to household debt and the housing market, such as Norway and Canada, there has 
been no corresponding debate about whether or not the policy rate should have remained at 
the level to which it was cut during the crisis.  
Policy clearly within our mandate 
Another argument that I think is fairly difficult to understand is that the Riksbank, because of 
the policy we have conducted, should have acted beyond our mandate and done something 
we should not have done. Sometimes it has been claimed that we have introduced a new 
target for monetary policy or that we have begun to conduct housing policy. Had we only kept 
to  our  task,  monetary  policy  would  have  been  more  expansionary,  we  would  have  come

closer to attaining the inflation target and everything would have been much better, the story 
goes. 
But as I have already said, the purpose of the policy conducted in recent years has been to 
create the conditions for a sustainable development in the Swedish economy by reducing the 
risk of excessive debt and inflated housing prices. After a number of years of rapidly-rising 
house prices and a build-up of debt among households, it became clear in many countries 
that  developments  were  based  on  overly  optimistic  calculations.  When  housing  prices  fell, 
household  assets  declined  in  value  rapidly,  but  the  size  of  the  loans  remained  the  same. 
Households in this situation have reduced their consumption and begun to save to achieve a 
better balance between assets and debts. This in turn has led to a fall in demand that has 
tended  to  be  fairly  long-lived.4  In  many  areas,  households  and  companies  have  moreover 
experienced  difficulty  in  meeting  their  loan  obligations  and  the  banks  have  suffered  loan 
losses. The much weaker economic activity and a banking system in need of support have in 
turn led to a tangible deterioration of public finances.  
The  final  result  of  the  high  indebtedness  and  overheated  housing  market  has  thus  been 
macroeconomic  instability  in  the  form  of  a  deep  and  prolonged  recession.  Moreover, 
monetary policy in many countries has become less effective as the policy rate has reached 
its  lower  bound  and  central  banks  have  had  to  turn  to  new  and  untried  methods  of 
conducting monetary policy, and also because households have reacted less than normal to 
monetary policy stimulus, as they have given priority to consolidating their balance sheets.5 
Trying to prevent this type of development with substantial macroeconomic instability must 
indeed be part of the Riksbank’s task. 
As I have already noted, one can make different assessments of how great is the risk that 
this negative scenario will occur and thus of the policy that should be conducted. But arguing 
that it is not in the Riksbank’s mandate, as a matter of principle, to take into account this type 
of  risk  and  reduce  it  to  the  best  of  our  ability  –  that  I  find  quite  difficult  to  comprehend.  It 
would have been very odd if we had ignored these risks with the justification that it is always 
more  important  to  try  to  attain  the  inflation  target  in  the  short  term  –  regardless  of  the 
consequences later on. For someone who believes that the risks linked to household debt 
are a threat to the stability of the Swedish economy, it is a little like feeling forced to step on 
the accelerator despite hearing that the engine is about to seize. 
It is not just a question of “bubbles” 
One  thing  I  consider  important  to  point  out  is  that  this  policy  does  not  necessarily  involve 
what are often called “bubbles”, although the situation may of course be particularly serious if 
households have unrealistic expectations of interest rates.6 Quite regardless of whether or 
not  an  upturn  in  housing  prices  has  natural  economic  or,  as  one  often  says,  fundamental 
explanations, it is problematic if indebtedness is increasing at a faster rate than income over 
a very long period of time, and there are few signs that the trend will be broken. Households 
will  then  become  gradually  more  vulnerable  and  liquidity  margins  will  become  smaller. 
Finally,  one  will  reach  a  point  where  even  fairly  small  shocks  to  income,  asset  prices  or 
interest  rates  can

fairly  substantial  effects  on 
trigger  adjustments 
that  have 
                                                 
4   See, for instance, Mian and Sufi (2011), Dynan (2012) and Jauch and Watzka (2013). Many say today that 
households’ debt overhang has caused as big a problem for the macroeconomy as the crisis in the banking 
system (see, for instance, Krugman, 2013).  
5   Bech,  Gambacorta  and  Kharroubi  (2012)  find  that  expansionary  monetary  policy  has  greater  difficulty 
contributing to a recovery from a financial crisis than after a normal economic downturn.

(2012).

macroeconomy.  Denmark  and  the  Netherlands  are  examples  of  otherwise  well-managed 
economies that have suffered this in recent years.7  
One risk factor that may be quite specific to Sweden is that the banks’ mortgage lending is 
largely market-funded and also to a large extent financed from abroad. If confidence were to 
be shaken for some reason, investors might choose to reduce their exposure to the Swedish 
banking sector. The banks’ access to market funding would thus decline. This could cause 
further negative developments or even be a factor that in itself triggers a downturn. 
The policy is not problem-free 
Of course, the type of policy we have conducted is not free of complications and problems. 
Although our policy has aimed to attain a good economic development and target attainment 
in  the  longer  run,  the  consequence  is  that  it  has  contributed,  at  least  on  the  margin,  to 
inflation  approaching  the  target  more  slowly  than  would  have  been  the  case  with  a  more 
expansionary  policy.  This  can  create  a  tension  between  short-term  and  long-term 
perspectives, which is not so easy to manage. 
As monetary policy-maker, one must weigh the more concrete and immediate disadvantages 
of a slightly larger deviation from the inflation target and a somewhat weaker economy in the 
short  run  against  the  more  abstract  and  uncertain,  but  potentially  much  greater  cost  of  a 
really  poor  development  further  ahead.  This  is  no  easy  assessment,  but  it  is  important  to 
realise  that  it  is  indeed  an  assessment,  where  the  answers  are  not  self-evident,  either  in 
general or from one time to another. 
A particularly difficult situation may arise if inflation is low and falling and growth is weak, at 
the same time as household debt and housing prices are rising. One might think that such a 
situation  is  not  very  common,  but  this  is  actually  to  some  extent  what  is  happening  in 
Sweden  now.  At  the  same  time  as  inflation  was  surprisingly  low  and  GDP  growth  very 
modest  according  to  the  most  recent  statistics,  more  people  are  now  expecting  housing 
prices to rise and the housing market is often being described as “red hot”.8  
Good to have clarity regarding macroprudential supervision – but no quick fix  
Given this, it is fairly obvious that it is difficult for monetary policy alone to do battle to reduce 
the risks linked to household borrowing and developments in the housing market. Support is 
both  desirable  and  necessary.  It  was  therefore  welcome  that  the  Government  put  its  foot 
down on 26 August regarding the allocation of responsibility for macroprudential policy – the 
new  policy  area  that  is  intended  to  be  the  primary  defence  against  this  type  of  problem.9 
Some details remain to be specified and it will take some time before the finished framework 
is  in  place,  but  it  is  clear  that  Finansinspektionen  will  have  the  main  responsibility  for 
macroprudential policy.  
The  fact  that  uncertainty  over  the  macroprudential  policy  framework  has  been  largely 
dispersed will improve the conditions for managing risks linked to high and rising household 
debt. The risks should decline as measures are taken and as macroprudential policy settles 
into its role and working methods. This may also be expected to ease some of the pressure

In the Netherlands, household debt as a percentage of disposable income amounted to at most approximately 
250 per cent, before a crash occurred. The corresponding figure in Denmark was around 300 per cent. 
8   For example, in November 2013, Statistics Sweden’s housing price indicator reached its highest level since 
July  2007  (SEB,  2013)  and  SKOP’s  November  survey  indicates  “new  record-high  expectations”  (SKOP, 
2013).

field  of  macroprudential  policy 
on monetary policy. However, it is difficult at present to say exactly how monetary policy will 
be affected. Time will tell.  
However, I believe there is a risk of now leaning back and assuming that all of the problems 
will  be  automatically  resolved,  or  perhaps  are  already  resolved.  This  is  not  a  quick  fix. 
Making  decisions 
task  and 
Finansinspektionen  has  a  difficult  workload  ahead.  Many  people  have  questioned  the 
efficiency  and  expediency  of  the  policy  rate  in  this  context.  But,  of  course,  there  are  a 
number of questions regarding macroprudential policy as well.  
An obvious complication is that macroprudential policy is a new field. There is rather limited 
practical experience of the effects of macroprudential policy measures and nor is academic 
research  able  to  provide  any  clear  guidance  as  yet.  This  means  that,  at  least  during  a 
transitional  period,  there  will  be  considerable  uncertainty  over  the  effects  of  the  measures 
taken.  
The objective of macroprudential policy – to prevent risks to the financial system as a whole 
– is moreover clearer on paper than in practice. It is of course not easy to know when the 
system  is  sufficiently  resilient  or  if  some  form  of  imbalance  is  building  up,  which  the  crisis 
clearly  illustrated.  There  are  no  numerical  targets  here,  and  determining  when  a  certain 
deviation has begun to be abnormal is rather difficult.10  
Finansinspektionen  will  probably  also  need  to  struggle  on  occasion  with  the  scepticism  of 
general opinion towards the need for macroprudential measures. There are different reasons 
for  this.  Let  us  assume  that  Finansinspektionen  conducts  a  wise  policy  in  the  coming 
decades and succeeds in preventing one or more financial crises that would otherwise have 
occurred.  It  would  be  very  difficult  to  actually  prove  that  this  was  due  to  successful 
macroprudential policy – the only thing that can be observed is that no crisis has occurred. I 
can  easily 
that 
Finansinspektionen  had  been  imagining  things  and  tightened  macroprudential  policy 
unnecessarily. Ironically, it may be the case that the more successful macroprudential policy 
is, the less useful it is perceived to be. Over time, this could lead to fairly strong pressure on 
Finansinspektionen not to take any action. 
In addition, there will of course also be the common criticism that one, as in monetary policy, 
is  “taking  away  the  punch  bowl  just  as  the  party  gets  going”.  Moreover,  it  is  possible  that 
macroprudential  policy  measures  will  be  perceived  as  more  dramatic  and  as  a  larger 
intervention  than  raising  the  repo  rate,  and  the  pressure  not  to  take  action  can  thus  be 
particularly great in this field.  
retrospect  would  be 
the  general 
impression 
imagine 
that 
in 
Macroprudential policy also needs support  
Just as monetary policy cannot be left alone to try to manage the risks linked to household 
debt and developments on the housing market, macroprudential policy cannot be left without 
support.  I  believe  it  is  important  that  there  is  some  degree  of  concordance  between 
macroprudential  policy  and  monetary  policy  –  so  that  they,  so  to  speak,  do  not  pull  in 
different directions, but help one another. 
There  are  several  reasons  for  this.  One  is  that  it  may  very  well  prove  difficult  to  design  a 
system  for  macroprudential  policy  that  functions  efficiently  and  which  inventive  market 
participants are not able to circumvent. The policy rate is a blunt instrument, as it has a broad 
                                                 
10   To mitigate these problems the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) recommends the EU countries to use 
a  set  of  intermediary  targets,  see  ESRB  (2013).  These  provide  some  assistance  but  do  not  solve  the 
fundamental problems.

impact  on  the  economy.  But  at  the  same  time,  this  may  be  a  strength  compared  with  the 
macroprudential tools, simply because it is difficult to avoid a policy rate increase.11 
Another reason is that if monetary policy is very expansionary over a long period of time, this 
could contributed to creating incorrect expectations in society regarding how high policy rates 
will  be  in  the  coming  period,  and  how  the  housing  market  will  develop.12  In  this  type  of 
environment it may be difficult for macroprudential policy to do the job alone. 
The assertion that policy areas need to interact and support one another – and that things 
can go badly if they don’t – is not particularly strange. A clear example from a Swedish point 
of view of diverging policies causing problems is the developments that led up to the crisis in 
the  1990s.  The  stabilisation  policy  conducted  was  on  the  whole  too  expansionary  to  be 
consistent  with  the  monetary  policy  regime  of  the  time,  the  fixed  exchange  rate,  and 
eventually the fixed exchange rate had to be abandoned. 
I would like to point out that these are not some “homemade” ideas and theories. There is an 
international  discussion,  which  does  not  seem  to  have  received  much  media  attention  in 
Sweden, that the policy rate may have a role to play even when macroprudential policy is in 
place.13 It is also worth emphasising that in several of the countries that have come through 
the crisis well – those who, like Sweden, are up in the right-hand corner of Figures 1 and 2, 
and currently facing the same problems as us with regard to debt and the housing market – 
they are quite specific about the policy rate being an important variable in this context.14 
But the supply side of the housing market is also crucial 
However,  the  question  is  whether  even  macroprudential  policy  and  monetary  policy  in 
collaboration are sufficient to achieve a long-term solution to the problems. It is likely that an 
even broader intervention is needed.  
Macroprudential policy and monetary policy focus on the demand side of the housing market 
–  by  trying  to  dampen  household  demand  for  credit  or  through  the  banks  restricting  their 
lending. However, the supply side of the housing market is also of central importance in this 
context. The large increase in household debt over the past fifteen years coincides to a large 
degree with the rise in housing prices (see Figure 7). One important reason for this is that the 
supply of housing has been small in relation to demand. After the crisis in the 1990s, housing 
construction in Sweden has been remarkably low, lower than in most comparable countries. 
The reasons are not entirely clear, but there are a number of explanations that are usually 
given, such as high construction costs, demanding regulations and regulated rents. I do not 
                                                 
11   Jeremy Stein at the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors has expressed it as the advantage of monetary 
policy being that it “gets in all of the cracks” (Stein, 2013, p. 17). The Riksbank has also raised this argument 
in various contexts, see for instance, Ingves (2010) and Nyberg (2011). 
12   In  a  study  of  18  OECD  countries  over  the  period  1921–2011,  Bordo  and  Landon-Lane  (2013)  show  that 
expansionary monetary policy has a significant effect on asset prices, particularly during periods when asset 
prices have increased rapidly, followed by a later severe downward adjustment. Maddaloni and Peydró (2013) 
find in a study of data for the euro area that banks ease their credit conditions during periods with low policy 
rates, even when the borrowers’ credit risk is held constant.  
13   See, for example, Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia and Mauro (2013), Borio (2013), Carney (2013), Smets (2013) and 
Stein (2013). 
14   Examples include Norges Bank (2013), p. 8: “Weight was also given to the fact that house prices and debt 
have risen faster than income for a long period. A lower key policy rate may increase the risk of a renewed 
acceleration in house prices and debt accumulation and of build-up of financial imbalances.”; Bank of Canada 
(2013):  “[T]he  Bank  must  also  take  into  consideration  the  risk  of  exacerbating  already-elevated  household 
imbalances.”;  and  the  Reserve  Bank  of  New  Zealand  (2012):  “In  addition,  the  PTA’s  stronger  focus  on 
financial stability makes it clearer that it may be appropriate to use monetary policy to lean against the build-up 
of  financial  imbalances,  if  the  Reserve  Bank  believes  this  could  prevent  a  sharper  economic  cycle  in  the 
future.”

intend  to  go  into  these  here,  but  merely  point  out  that  if  the  supply  had  adapted  better  to 
demand, the price increases in the housing market would have been more limited and thus 
household debt would have given less cause for concern.15 
Merely slowing down the demand side, without trying to make the supply side function better, 
is probably not sustainable – at any rate it does not appear to be a particularly wise long-run 
strategy.  Housing  policy  probably  also  needs  to  be  included  in  the  equation  for  a  lasting 
solution  to  be  achieved.  What  macroprudential  policy  can  do,  with  the  possible  support  of 
monetary policy, is to bridge over the problems – try to ensure that the situation does not 
worsen while waiting for the supply side of the housing market to begin functioning better. To 
make a slightly drastic comparison, one might say that what macroprudential policy can do is 
to give first aid on site while awaiting the ambulance. A first aid effort may be necessary to 
save the patient’s life, but without continued nursing it is still uncertain whether the patient 
will survive. 
Low housing construction is of course one of the “fundamentals” explaining why prices have 
increased so much. But this is no real comfort. A large part of the problem is, as I mentioned 
earlier, that we appear over the past couple of decades to have been in a process where 
housing  prices  and  debt  only  slow  down  slightly  during  economic  downswings  and  then 
continue  upwards  again  when  times  improve.  This  makes  households  –  and  thus  the 
economy as a whole – gradually more vulnerable, and this is simply not sustainable in the 
long run. 
Several policy areas must collaborate   
To  change  course,  or  reprogram  the  system,  I  believe  a  lot  of  helping  hands  are  needed. 
One major challenge is to take measures in a way that avoids as far as possible a rapid and 
dramatic adjustment of debt and housing prices. One could say that what we need to achieve 
is  a  “slow  puncture”,  where  we  gradually  return  to  a  more  sustainable  situation,  with  a 
considerable reduction of the risk of a household debt overhang causing problems. This is of 
course  a  substantial  challenge  and  can  hardly  be  managed  unless  several  policy  areas 
collaborate in the process.  
I have so far talked about the housing market mainly from a monetary policy perspective – 
where the main problem is that rising house prices are reflected in rising debt, which makes 
the  economy  more  vulnerable  to  shocks.  But  there  are  of  course  other,  more  structural 
reasons  why  it  is  desirable  that  the  housing  market  functions  well.  One  is  that  a  poorly-
functioning  housing  market  can  lead  to  poorer  geographical  mobility,  which  can  put  a 
spanner in the works of the labour market. This has a negative effect on the conditions for 
growth.16  Another  reason  is  that  supply  restrictions  in  the  housing  market  result  in  an 
unjustifiable redistribution of wealth from future house buyers to existing house owners. The 
problems on the Swedish housing market have been debated for decades, but I perceive that 
the  discussion  has  recently  been  particularly  intensive.17  Perhaps  the  time  is  now  ripe  for 
some substantive political action? 
                                                 
15   A  study  by  Jahnson  and  Lundberg  (2013)  estimates  that  prices  on  the  Swedish  housing  market  today  are 
roughly one third higher than if construction had developed in the same way as in Finland over the past fifteen 
years.  There  are  relatively  few  studies  using  Swedish  data  of  the  significance  of  various  regulations  for 
housing  prices.  In  a  study  of  US  data,  Paciorek  (2013)  finds  that  differences  in  the  scope  of  regulation 
between different cities explains a large proportion of the differences in fluctuations in housing prices.    
16   Another interesting hypothesis on how the conditions for growth may be affected is that rising housing prices 
can mean that banks’ lending to companies is “crowded out” by increased lending to the housing market. This 
can lead to a fall in investment. For a study on US data, see Chakraborty, Goldstein and MacKinlay (2013). 
17   For some examples, see Dagens Industri (2013), Swedbank (2013) and Lindbeck (2013).

Let me summarise, in conclusion, what have been my most important messages here today. 
Firstly, I think that the Swedish economy has managed to come through the financial crisis 
relatively  well,  in  an  international  perspective.  Secondly,  I  consider  that  the  policy  the 
Riksbank has conducted, which has aimed at reducing the risks linked to household debt and 
the housing market, is well within the mandate the Riksbank has been given. Thirdly, I think 
that  the  fact  that  macroprudential  policy  has  begun  to  take  shape  is  a  step  in  the  right 
direction,  but  not  a  quick  fix  that  will  solve  all  problems.  Finally,  and  partly  on  the  same 
theme, I consider that many policy areas must cooperate to rectify the problem of a high and 
rising  debt  in  the  household  sector.  It  is  not  enough,  for  instance,  to  focus  on  dampening 
households’ demand for housing. If the reprogramming of the system is to succeed, we will 
also need reforms that increase housing construction.
