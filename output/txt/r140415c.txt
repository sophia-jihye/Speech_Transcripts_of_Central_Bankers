Rodrigo Vergara: Chile’s March 2014 Monetary Policy Report 
Presentation by Mr Rodrigo Vergara, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, of the Monetary 
Policy  Report  before  the  Honorable  Senate  of  the  Republic,  Santiago  de  Chile,  31  March 
2014. 
 Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech. 
Mr. President of the Senate’s Finance Commission, Senator Ricardo Lagos-Weber. Senators 
members of this Commission, ladies, gentlemen, 
Thank you for your invitation to share with you the vision of the Central Bank Board about the 
recent macroeconomic developments, its outlook and implications for monetary policy. The 
detail of this vision is contained in our March 2014 Monetary Policy Report. 
A  year  ago,  when  the  Board  gathered  with  this  Commission  on  a  similar  occasion,  we 
underscored  the  importance  of  investment  in  the  Chilean  economy’s  strength  and  its 
connection  with  the  global  cycle  of  mining  investments.  We  then  stated  that  the 
implementation of a large number of projects in mining and related sectors, such as energy, 
had provided a boom in investment. This had resulted in greater domestic spending, putting 
pressure on installed capacity utilization and the labor market, as well as on imports and the 
current-account deficit of the balance of payments. 
The  Board  also  noted  that  it  foresaw  at  the  time  a  gradual  maturation  of  said  investment 
cycle and expected a normalization of economic growth during 2013, after several years of 
expanding  above  trend.  Accordingly,  an  easing  of  the  pressure  on  domestic  productive 
resources was also expected, together with a reduction in the trend current-account deficit. 
Later  on,  beginning  last  June,  we  drew  attention  to  the  international  financial  conditions 
which were beginning to normalize, after announcements by the Federal Reserve Board of 
the  United  States.  We  noted  then  that  this  process  could  create  increased  short-term 
volatility  in  the  global  economy  and  the  international  financial  markets,  as  portfolios  were 
adjusted and spending plans were reviewed, but that, at the medium term it was a healthy 
development because it would create an environment that would help prevent the incubation 
of financial vulnerabilities. At the same time, we noted that the Chilean economy was on a 
good  stand  to  address  this  transition  in  international  liquidity.  Our  inflation-targeting  and 
floating  exchange  rate  regimes,  our  sound  fiscal  accounts  and  strong  financial  system, 
together with our healthy external financial structure allowed us to confront with relative calm 
this process and help cushion its impact on our economy. 
Throughout  the  past  year,  we  have  seen  both  a  moderation  in  the  investment  impulse  in 
Chile  as  the  gradual  normalization  of  global  financial  conditions.  Investment  has  adjusted 
more sharply than anticipated, such that our economy grew less than  we projected in late 
2013, which also reflects in a downward revision of Chile’s growth forecast for 2014. Still, I 
would like to say that other mineral exporting economies have given a surprise in the same 
direction, hand in hand with the worsening of China’s economic outlook. The convergence of 
metal  prices  toward  their  production  costs  has  been  somewhat  faster  than  thought  a  year 
ago. In the case of copper, the price forecast for 2014 in this Report has been lowered by 
more than 10 percent in one year. Other demand components, such as consumption, have 
posted a more gradual deceleration, in line with still favorable, yet moderating, fundamentals. 
International financial conditions have also been normalizing, which, while positive over the 
medium  to  long  term,  has  caused  increased  volatility,  higher  risk  premiums  and  capital 
outflows in emerging markets, together with a widespread depreciation of currencies vis a vis 
the U.S. dollar.

In Chile, contrasting with past episodes, the financial effects have been bounded. The risk 
premium,  for  instance,  is  the  same  or  slightly  higher  than  previous  values.  Unlike  other 
emerging  economies,  Chile  has  seen  a  drop  in  interest  rates  in  the  recent  past,  and  the 
Central  Bank  has  not  intervened  in  the  forex  market  by  selling  reserves  as  have  other 
countries. 
Nonetheless,  consistently  with  our  macroeconomic  policy  regime,  we  have  seen  a 
substantial  impact  on  the  exchange  rate.  Actually,  the  Chilean  peso  depreciation  is  in  the 
upper half of the group of emerging economies (figure 1). The real exchange rate has also 
depreciated  significantly  and  is  above  its  averages  for  the  last  fifteen  and  twenty  years 
(figure 2).  This  depreciation  of  our  currency,  however,  is  an  optimal  response  to  the  new 
circumstances,  as  it  implies  an  adjustment  of  relative  prices  and  thus  contributes  to  the 
rebalancing  of  sources  of  growth  across  economic  sectors.  In  other  words,  it  shifts  the 
growth dynamic from domestic demand to exports. 
In this scenario, Chilean inflation has returned to the vicinity of 3 percent (bear in mind that 
last  year  it  was  most  of  the  time  in  the  lower  part  of  the  Central  Bank’s  tolerance  range: 
2 percent) (figure 3). 
So  this  big  depreciation  of  the  Chilean  peso  has  not  altered  the  forecast  that  inflation  will 
remain  in  line  with  the  target  over  the  policy  horizon.  This  reflects  that  the  pass-through 
coefficient, which measures how much of the depreciation is translated into higher prices, so 
far  has  not  created  unwanted  propagation  to  inflation.  Of  course  there  are  items  that 
immediately  reflect  any  exchange  rate  movements,  like  fuels,  for  example.  But  the  pass-
through to core inflation trends and expectations is not so mechanical. On one hand, there is 
evidence suggesting that it depends on the economy’s cyclical conditions, meaning that in 
the present circumstances, where gaps are being formed, this pass-through should be small. 
On the other hand, said coefficient has shrunk over time as the inflation targeting scheme 
has  consolidated.  Thus,  the  credibility  of  monetary  policy  also  reduces  the  coefficient, 
allowing us to project that, beyond short-term effects, inflation will stay near the target over 
the  policy  horizon.  (The  Monetary  Policy  Report  contains  a  box  with  more  details  on  the 
pass-through coefficient). 
For the same reason, monetary policy has moved to a more expansionary instance, and the 
monetary policy rate (MPR) has been lowered by 100 basis points over recent months to a 
level  of  4  percent  annually.  Furthermore,  as  we  said  in  our  last  press  release,  we  will 
consider the possibility of making additional cuts to the policy rate, in line with the evolution 
of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions and its implications on the inflationary 
outlook. 
Some  market  players  and  observers  have  suggested  that  the  current  scenario  of  slower 
growth and higher inflation poses a dilemma to monetary policy makers. This, meaning that, 
in  the  current  circumstances  of  some  deceleration  and  a  slight  rise  in  inflation,  one  must 
prioritize one or other of these variables. We believe, for the aforesaid reasons that there is 
no such dilemma. Actually, our baseline scenario assumes that, as we will see in a  while, 
inflation will rise temporarily to the upper zone of the tolerance range, but by the end of this 
year it will be close to the target. 
But if such a situation was to persist, there could be a dilemma. This is why we continually 
watch  for  the  so-called  “second-round  effects”, that  is,  if  a  change  in  the  parity  puts  more 
persistent  pressure  on  the  other  prices.  In  that  case,  the  Central  Bank  will  take  every 
measure necessary for inflation to quickly return to the target. That is our mandate. 
The way our economy has reacted to the recent changes in the terms of trade and external 
financial  conditions  is  precisely  a  reflection  of  our  policy  regime,  which  allows  for  timely 
adjustments in the real exchange rate and interest rates, letting the economy grow near its 
potential,  smooth  the  capital  account’s  adjustments  and  maintain  the  credibility  of  the 
inflation target. This marks a difference with our economic history.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
Over the years, the Central Bank has given proof of its commitment with price stability and 
the  inflation  target.  It  has  operated  with  consistency  in  order  to  build  credibility  and  trust, 
which  gives  us  the  necessary  flexibility  for  monetary  policy  and  the  real  exchange  rate  to 
work as buffers of the business cycle whenever advisable. 
In the past, when our economy’s fundamentals were not as strong, and the exchange rate 
regime was rigid and poorly suited to confront external shocks, when faced by a drop in the 
terms of trade or stringent financial conditions, in order to stop a currency depreciation the 
Bank had to sell international reserves and raise the interest rate to reduce capital outflows. 
Monetary  policy,  far  from  cushioning  the  external  cycles,  made  them  worse,  generating 
economic costs and financial risks. More often than not, these experiences ended badly. 
Overall, as usual, the present scenario has varied risks, most of them coming from emerging 
economies, because of both their importance in commodity prices and the behavior of world 
financial  markets.  Despite  the  strong  fundamentals  of  the  Chilean  economy,  we  are  not 
immune. We are a small, open economy, so external developments can and do affect us. 
Now, allow me to describe in detail the macroeconomic scenario we believe to be the most 
likely one in the coming quarters, and associated risks. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
Our  baseline  scenario  assumes  that  in  2014  the  emerging  markets  will  grow  below  their 
averages of recent years. China is a case in point, whose growth forecast has been steadily 
revised  downward  during  the  past  several  months  and  is  now  even  below  the  officially 
defined target of 7.5 percent per year (figure 4). Other Latin American economies, including 
Brazil, Mexico and Peru, have also revised downward their respective projections. This owes 
to a number of factors. On one hand, the weaker fiscal and monetary impulse in Brazil, poor 
growth  in  Mexico  and  a  slowdown  in  investment  and  exports  in  Peru.  On  the  other  hand, 
Argentina and Venezuela are making substantial corrections to their growth outlooks for the 
year, of the order of 3 percentage points down (figure 5). 
All this contrasts with the developed world, where growth forecasts for the year have been 
revised upward, although with different nuances. Worth noting is the improved performance 
of  the  United  States  and  confirmed  signals  of  recovery  in  the  Eurozone.  Taking  these 
changes  together,  that  is,  higher  expected  growth  in  the  developed  economies  and  lower 
growth  in  the  emerging  world,  considering  their  relative  weights,  drives  our  forecast  for 
Chile’s  trading  partners  marginally  up  for  2014  and  2015,  to  an  average  of  3.8  percent 
(3.7 percent in December). 
The financial conditions facing our economy have not changed materially since December, 
while the terms of trade have worsened. Overall, compared with recent years, our external 
scenario  will  be  less  favorable  this  year.  This  because,  on  the  one  hand,  foreign  interest 
rates  have  risen  as  has  risk  aversion  towards  emerging  markets.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
price of copper has been falling for some months. In fact, at the statistical close of this Report 
it had dropped past the barrier of 3 dollars per pound. Our baseline scenario foresees that 
the pound of copper will trade at an average of 3 dollars in 2014 and 2.85 dollars in 2015 
(table 1). 
As I said before, in the past few months output and demand growth fell short of our forecasts 
in  the  previous  Monetary  Policy  Report,  particularly  in  investment-related  sectors.  Output 
grew  4.1  percent  annually  in  2013,  with  a  sharp  deceleration  during  the  second  half.  One 
determinant  was  the  behavior  of  sectors  unrelated  to  natural  resources,  especially  those 
associated  with  investment  such  as  construction  and  part  of  trade  and  manufacturing. 
Among  the  components  of  demand,  gross  fixed  capital  formation  posted  the  sharpest 
downward adjustment. Machinery and equipment posted negative y-o-y growth in the third 
and  fourth  quarters  of  2013,  while  construction  and  other  works  decelerated  significantly 
during the same period (figure 6).

This  correction  to  investment  growth  owes  to  various  factors.  For  one,  there  is  the 
aforementioned  investment  cycle  of  mining  and  related  sectors,  plus  the  postponement  of 
some  investment  plans.  Although  this  was  an  expected  development,  its  magnitude  was 
unclear. Another factor is the low basis for comparison of the same months of 2012, which 
were swollen by unusual imports of transportation material, which affects the y-o-y variation 
of  capital  goods  imports.  There  is  also  the  downturn  of  expectations  reflected  in  business 
confidence  surveys  and  our  business  perception  report  Informe  de  Percepciones  de 
Negocios. Lastly, there is the drop of public investment in real terms during the last quarter of 
the year, and the depreciation of the real exchange rate, which raises the costs of foreign 
capital goods. 
Accordingly, private growth forecasts for this year have been revised downward. Our March 
Economic Expectations Survey lowered GDP growth in 2014 from 4.1 percent in November 
to  3.7  percent  in  March.  Thus,  the  baseline  scenario  of  this  Report  has  lowered  the  GDP 
growth estimate for 2014. 
The Board estimates that this year our economy will grow between 3 and 4 percent (3.75 to 
4.75 percent in December), that is, less than last year and below trend. This means that this 
year investment will fall short of projections, with an annual growth rate that is now estimated 
closer to 1 percent (4.1 percent in December). It also inputs first-quarter data available, as 
well  as  the  downward  revisions  to  investment  in  2013  and  the  turn  of  2014  shown  by  the 
latest survey of the capital goods corporation CBC. Another factor behind the lower growth 
forecast for the immediate future is the upward correction to inventory levels, meaning that 
this source of expansion will provide a smaller impulse. The baseline scenario also estimates 
that,  as  has  been  occurring  for  some  quarters,  private  consumption  will  post  a  moderate 
slowdown, grounded on a looser labor income and a stable borrowing trend. 
This year, growth will go from less to more. Such a trajectory assumes that investment will 
stabilize, due to several elements coming together. On one hand, the CBC survey shows an 
increase  in  investment  plans  in  engineering  works  in  the  second  half  of  2014  and  for  the 
period 2015–2016. On the other, there is housing construction that should continue the trend 
of last year, considering that the supply of homes is still low, housing sales are strong, and 
financial  conditions  (i.e.  credit  cost  and  volume)  remain  favorable.  Meanwhile,  the  fiscal 
budget for 2014 is expected to be more in line with historical patterns, implying greater public 
spending  with  respect  to  2013,  especially  investment.  Machinery  and  equipment  imports 
have been stable for some months. Plus, the somewhat stronger growth of trading partners 
and the depreciation of the real exchange rate should also boost non-mining exports. And 
last  but  not  least,  there  is  the  increased  monetary  impulse  that  has  been  added  to  the 
economy. 
As  for  domestic  inflation,  it  has  returned  back  to  the  Central  Bank  target  of  3  percent  in 
annual terms faster than expected. In recent months, CPI inflation has been driven by energy 
price increases that reflect both the higher dollar price of fuels and the depreciation of the 
peso. The impact of the depreciation on other prices in the CPI basket has been in line with 
expectations; Core inflation (i.e., the CPIEFE that excludes foodstuffs and energy) has also 
risen, although at a slower pace than headline CPI. Inflation expectations have remained at 
3 percent in the projection horizon, with a slight increase in the near term. 
The  baseline  scenario  assumes  that  y-o-y  CPI  inflation  will  rise  temporarily  to  the  3.5  to 
4 percent  range,  in  the  coming  months,  reflecting  the  direct  propagation  of  the  peso 
depreciation  to  the  prices  of  goods  and  services.  The  lower  use  of  installed  capacity  – 
proxied  by  the  behavior  of  output  –  should  mitigate  inflationary  pressures  and  the  direct 
effects  of  the  depreciation.  As  I  just  said,  the  credibility  and  consolidation  of  our  inflation-
targeting scheme also help. Therefore, already by the end of 2014 headline inflation should 
move closer to 3 percent, where it should stay until the end of the projection horizon, that is, 
the  first  quarter  of  2016.  Core  inflation  will  hover  around  3  percent  throughout  the  same 
horizon (figure 7).

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
The current account deficit of the balance of payments is forecast to stand at 3.6 percent of 
GDP  in  2014,  up  a  little  from  2013,  but  below  the  December  estimate.  Behind  it  is  the 
expected  decline  in  the  copper  price  this  year,  which  more  than  offsets  the  lower  growth 
foreseen in domestic demand and imports. This implies that, measured at trend prices, the 
deficit  will  narrow  further,  approaching  3  percent  of  GDP.  As  for  GDP,  the  rate  of  total 
investment  will  go  slightly  above  23  percent  in  nominal  terms  (somewhat  more  than 
25 percent in real terms), while national savings should amount to 19.5 percent (table 2). 
Aside  from  the  already  discussed  trajectories  foreseen  for  domestic  growth  and  the  world 
economy, this forecast uses as a working assumption that nominal wages will be adjusted in 
line  with  productivity  and  the  inflation  target.  It  also  uses  as  a  methodological  assumption 
that  the  real  exchange  rate  will  remain  stable,  considering  that  it  is  now  inside  the  range 
believed to be consistent with its long-term fundamentals. Finally, the baseline scenario uses 
as a working methodological assumption that the  MPR  will follow a trend comparable with 
the  one  that  can  be  derived  by  the  prices  of  financial  assets  prevailing  at  the  statistical 
closing of this Report (figure 8). 
The baseline scenario reflects those events that are believed to be the most likely to occur 
with the information at hand at the closing of this Report. There are risk scenarios, however, 
which  if  materialized,  may  reshape  the  macroeconomic  environment  and,  therefore,  may 
modify the course of monetary policy. On this opportunity, having evaluated the alternative 
scenarios,  the  Board  estimates  that  the  risk  balance  is  downward  biased  for  output  and 
unbiased for inflation. 
Abroad, one first risk has to do with the behavior of emerging economies, especially China. 
The  latter  risk  has  been  present  in  several  Reports  already  and  has  recently  been 
exacerbated  because  of  growing  doubts  posed  by  the  fragility  of  the  Chinese  financial 
system and the overall increase in the risk perception of the emerging world. In particular, 
adeterioration in the Chinese economy would have first-order effects on Chile and the group 
of  emerging  economies,  spreading  through  both  real  and  financial  channels.  Of  particular 
importance is its impact on the prices of commodities, including copper, as well as on the 
growth  of  other  important  trading  partners.  Moreover,  it  cannot  be  ruled  out  that  the 
vulnerabilities  that  some  emerging  economies  have  accumulated  may  generate  new 
episodes of volatility 
It  is  also  possible  for  the  recovery  process  in  the  U.S.  to  end  up  being  stronger  than 
expected. The timing of its effects shows different signs. In the short term, the anticipated 
normalization of the monetary stimulus could lead to a worsening of financial conditions for 
the emerging world, inducing new episodes of volatility as in recent quarters. Going forward, 
the  effect  of  increased  external  demand  and  higher  commodity  prices  would  prevail,  with 
positive  effects  on  economies  like  Chile  that  have  solid  fundamentals.  Overall,  the  risk 
associated with the complex fiscal and financial situation in the Eurozone is still present and, 
moreover, heightening of geopolitical tensions in Ukraine could affect commodity prices, as 
well as confidence in Europe. 
At the local level, an important part of the economic slowdown of recent quarters is due to a 
drop  in  investment. The  baseline  scenario  assumes that this  phenomenon  will  not  deepen 
and for some components it will even be reversed. But there are risks, particularly since the 
drop in investment in late 2013 was sharper than expected. For example, it is possible that, 
due to its natural inertia, investment may remain weak for longer than foreseen. Another risk 
is that a deterioration of the global economy may pull down the copper price below its long-
term level, deferring new projects and slowing economic growth. 
Still locally, inflation of recent months, like the projections included in the baseline scenario, 
show  limited  pass-through  of  the  peso  depreciation  to  prices,  in  line  with  economic 
fundamentals. As I said, the consolidation of the inflation-targeting regime and the economic 
slowdown restrict the degree of propagation to final prices, wages and expectations, so the 
recent rise in inflation is believed to be transitory. However, it is necessary to watch out for 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

second-round  effects  to  make  sure  they  remain  contained,  particularly  considering  that 
margins have narrowed in some sectors due to increases in costs, such as energy, and that 
the labor market remains relatively tight. 
Final remarks 
The  macroeconomic  scenario  shows  economic  slowdown  beyond  projections  of  a  few 
months back, with inflation hovering around 3%. The external short-term outlook for Chile is 
less favorable than it was a year ago. In addition, further doubts have emerged regarding the 
performance of some of the big economies, especially China. 
Just like we have done in the past few years, we are facing challenging conditions. The world 
economy is going through a new stage, where the central banks of developing economies 
are beginning to withdraw their extraordinary monetary stimulus packages, and the prices of 
our exports are returning to normal. 
Without a doubt, beyond the volatility and uncertainty that we have seen in recent quarters, 
the improved performance and recovery of developed economies is good news for everyone. 
It opens the door to markets that have been severely depressed for some years and, in the 
end,  such  unusual  and  persistent  financial  conditions  eventually  create  imbalances.  And 
imbalances are bound to become increasingly costly as time passes. 
Chile has managed to navigate this period with no accumulation of imbalances. Still, we will 
inevitably  be  affected.  The  cycle  of  high  commodity  prices  is  starting  to  reverse  and  the 
copper price will thus approach its medium-term levels. As I noted, the recent reduction in 
investment is partly associated with this factor and is also one defined risk in our baseline 
scenario. 
Thankfully,  our  policy  regime  provides  us  with  the  tools  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  a  more 
adverse scenario. Moreover, our country is well prepared to deal with future challenges. The 
depreciation  of  the  peso  has  been  a  buffer,  especially  because  it  allows  relative  prices  to 
adjust  and  thus  rebalance  resources  and  lessen  the  impact  on  output  and  employment.  It 
also  has  an  effect  on  inflation.  This  effect  has  been  limited,  in  line  with  our  economy’s 
fundamentals and the state of capacity gaps. This is also related with the credibility of our 
monetary policy’s commitment with the inflation target. 
Inasmuch  as  macroeconomic  conditions  warrant,  the  Central  Bank  has  the  room  and  the 
determination to continue contributing to mitigate the cyclical slowdown of the economy. But 
we  also  reaffirm  our  commitment  to  achieving  price  stability,  indicating  that  we  will  do 
everything  necessary  to  ensure  that  projected  inflation  is  aligned  with  the  3  percent target 
over the policy horizon. As we have said time and again, this is the main contribution that 
monetary policy can make to the development and well-being of our country. 
Thank you.
