  Mark Carney: Prospects for the UK labour market 
Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial 
Stability Board, at the 146th Annual Trades Union Congress, Liverpool, 9 September 2014. 
 President and Congress. 
It is a pleasure to be in Liverpool today to discuss the prospects for the UK labour market. 
The growth and distribution of jobs and incomes matter to everyone. 
Employment does much more than provide the means to support workers and their families; 
it is essential to personal fulfilment and human dignity. 
Part of that dignity is being paid a living wage. 
Over the past year, the Bank of England has ensured that it pays all of its 3,600 staff at least 
the living wage. 
And  we  have  recently  brought  all  our  contracted  service  staff  in  central  London  up  to  the 
London living wage. 
We are in the process of our final review. But I can announce today the Bank’s intention to 
become an accredited Living Wage employer by the time of the next TUC conference. 
Of course, the Bank of England’s responsibilities for promoting the good of the people of the 
United Kingdom go much further than being a responsible employer. 
We manage monetary policy to achieve price stability: low, stable and predictable inflation. 
And we promote financial stability by regulating and supervising financial institutions as well 
as by taking targeted actions to insure against unsustainable indebtedness, as we did earlier 
this year for the housing market. 
By maintaining price and financial stability we put in place the foundations for sustainable job 
creation and income growth. 
Stability gives workers the confidence to invest in skills or to change jobs. And it gives firms 
the confidence to hire new  workers, invest in new equipment, introduce new products and 
pursue new markets. We need workers with the right skills. And we need companies taking 
strategic  initiatives  to  grow  productivity.  That  productivity  is  needed  to  secure  real  wage 
increases over the medium term. 
And as I will explain, the labour market is central to our decisions – decisions which must 
take  into  account  both  short-term  fluctuations  and  the  profound  changes  sweeping  labour 
markets across advanced economies. 
These changes include: 
• 
Powerful  demographic  forces,  notably  the  ageing  of  the  workforce,  increases  in 
longevity and rising participation of women in the workplace; 
How  globalisation  and  new  technologies  are  splitting  production  chains  across 
companies and across borders; 
How financial risk is being steadily shifted to employees from both employers and 
the  state  through  changes  to  the  structure  of  pensions  and  benefits,  reduced  job 
security and evolving labour market institutions, including the union movement; 
  BIS central bankers’ speeches

  The  sharp  reduction  in  the  employment  share  of  middle-skilled  jobs,  relative  to 
more- and less-skilled jobs; so-called job polarisation.1 
 Collectively, these trends have affected the dynamism of labour markets and the spending 
patterns of families. 
And they have interacted with the forces unleashed by the Great Recession to challenge the 
durability of the expansion. 
The Great Recession led to enormous dislocations in advanced economy labour markets. 
In  many  economies  unemployment  and  underemployment  skyrocketed.  Youth 
unemployment reached perilous levels. 
Central banks responded with unprecedented monetary stimulus. 
That was consistent with their price stability mandates. And it recognised the threat that the 
recession might permanently scar the workforce. 
As the recovery in many advanced economies has evolved, central banks are assessing the 
extent  of  structural  changes  in  labour  markets  and  are  grappling  with  what  they  mean  for 
monetary policy. 
The answer is not uniform across major economies. This is one reason why monetary policy 
in  the  US,  euro  area  and  the  UK  can  be  expected  to  be  less  synchronised  than  in  recent 
years. 
A tale of three labour markets 
1. 
Indeed,  despite  common  underlying  influences,  differences  in  how  the  labour  markets  of 
major economies responded to the Great Recession have been striking (Chart 1). 
The US 
Take the world’s largest economy – the United States – as a benchmark. 
Unemployment there more than doubled during the recession. While that rate has recently 
fallen back, that headline is much better than the details. 
The  number  of  Americans  in  work  has  only  just  returned  to  where  it  was  before  Lehman 
failed, even though there are now 14 million more people of working age. 
Much of the fall in the unemployment rate is the result of workers in their prime leaving the 
labour force.2, 3

employment and earnings”, Handbook of Labor Economics, Volume 4b, Elsevier. 
2  See Yellen, J (2014), “Labor market dynamics and monetary policy”, Remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Kansas City Economic Symposium, Jackson Hole. In addition, Erceg and Levin (2013) show that there was a 
reduction in US participation rates of around 2½% between 2007–12. Of that, rates fell most markedly among 
the  young  (reflecting  higher  educational  enrolment)  and  ‘prime  age’  adults  25–54  years  old.  There  was  a 
sharp  up-tick  in  older  workers  claiming  forms  of  social  insurance;  but  that  was  partly  offset  by  higher 
participation  rates  among  older  workers,  perhaps  reflecting  a  need  to  offset  lost  retirement  income.  Erceg, 
C and Levin, A (2013), “Labour force participation and monetary policy in the wake of the Great Recession”, 
IMF Working Paper No. 13/245, July.  
3  The 3pp fall in the participation rate is a marked break from its stable level in the preceding decade. Overall 
participation  was  flat at  around  66%  between  2004–7.  It  had  fallen  to  below  63%  in  early  2014  (Bureau of 
Labour Statistics). By contrast, before that, and over the longer run, participation rates had been essentially 
acyclical – invariant to business cycle conditions (Erceg and Levin, 2013).

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  Far  more  vacancies  remain  unfilled  than  usual,  indicating  big  mismatches  in  the  labour 
market. And fewer people than normal are switching jobs, suggesting an ongoing reluctance 
to take risks. 
The American labour market still is not working as it once did. 
The UK 
Even though times for many families have been tough, relative to that benchmark, the UK 
labour market has performed well. 
Despite  a  recession  that  was  deeper  and  more  prolonged,  unemployment  did  not  rise  as 
much and has fallen back sharply since.4 
In  contrast  to  the  US,  this  rapid  fall  has  been  accompanied  by  significantly  higher 
participation rates. 
There are now over one million more people in work in the UK than at the start of the crisis. 
Total hours worked are some 4% above their pre-crisis level. 
That exceptional employment performance has come at a cost, however: wage growth has 
been very weak. Adjusted for inflation, wages have fallen by around a tenth since the onset 
of the crisis. 
To find such a fall in the past, you would have to look back to the early 1920s. 
The weakness of pay has, in effect, purchased more job creation. It has not resulted in an 
unusually high level of profits. 
The  burden  of  the  Great  Recession  has  been  shared  across  the  UK.  Profits  have  been 
squeezed  almost  as  much  as  labour  costs.  Employees  have  seen  their  real  incomes 
reduced, but more people are in work as a result. 
In the US, the burden has been much more concentrated on those who have lost, and not 
regained, work. And in contrast to the UK, American companies have increased their profits 
significantly as a share of national income. 
The euro area 
What makes the UK performance even more remarkable is that we have faced the added 
challenge of rebuilding competitiveness. 
In the run-up to the crisis, the UK’s economy had become increasingly imbalanced. 
When the crisis hit, sterling fell by a quarter. Prices of imported goods rose sharply and that 
fed through to higher inflation. 
The squeeze on real incomes was pronounced. And yet there were relatively few calls for 
higher wages to compensate. 
As a result of that painful adjustment, the UK is more competitive. And if the world economy 
returns  to  a  surer  footing,  there  is  a  real  prospect  that  the  UK  can  properly  rebalance  its 
economy.5 
                                                
4  Outturns for unemployment have remained some way below what would have been expected given the past 
relationship  between  changes  in  unemployment  and  growth  (Okun’s  law).  Year-on-year  increases  in 
unemployment during 2008-9, for example, remained around 1ppt below a simple Okun relationship based on 
data  since  the  early  1970s.  That  is  in  stark  contrast  to  the  experience  of  the  US  in  that  period,  where 
unemployment outturns were some way above past Okun’s law relationships.

growth”, Speech at the London School of Economics, January.

  Euro-area  countries  have  needed  to  make  similar  –  if  larger  –  adjustments  to  restore 
competitiveness  but  with  less  flexible  labour  markets  and  without  a  flexible  currency 
(Charts 2–4). 
The results have been dire. Euro-area unemployment has risen sharply over two successive 
recessions to its current rate of over 11%. It stands at over 14% in Portugal, 20% in Spain, 
and 25% in Greece. 
Over  6%  of  the  euro-area  labour  force  is  now  long-term  unemployed  and  in  danger  of 
becoming  detached  from  the  labour  market.6  And  despite  high  unemployment,  there  is 
evidence of labour shortages.7 
There is a clear danger of a misplaced if not lost generation of workers in the euro area and 
in the US. Britain’s labour force and trade unions deserve great credit for ensuring that this 
risk is much lower in the UK. By sharing the burden, our economy is better positioned for the 
future. The question is whether we will seize the opportunity. 
Why the UK labour market outperformed: a labour supply shock 
2. 
Before considering how we can, it is helpful to understand just why the UK labour market has 
outperformed. 
When  the  recession  hit,  the  demand  for  labour  naturally  fell.  But  surprisingly  the  potential 
supply  of  labour  appears  to  have  increased  as  well  with  an  estimated  1.5  million  people 
entering the labour force. 
The  number  of  additional  people  wanting  to  work  overwhelmed  the  longer-term  effects  of 
population ageing, which, all else equal, would have been expected to have removed around 
half a million people from the labour force (Chart 10). 
This expansion of the workforce is being driven mainly by women and older workers. Before 
the Great Recession, between 46% and 83% of those in the 50- to 64-year-old age cohort 
were active. Now it is between 60% and 89% (Table 1). In part this reflects a continuation of 
past trends within age cohorts, but it goes much further.8 
The greater risks and financial burdens that many are now facing are likely to be important 
drivers of the recent increase in the labour force. 
Changes to pension arrangements have encouraged people to work longer.9 State pension 
ages are rising, and the default retirement age has been abolished.10 
                                                
6  The average of European Commission, OECD and IMF estimates of structural unemployment have increased 
from 8.8% in 2008 to 10.3% in 2013, reported in Draghi, M (2014), “Unemployment in the euro area”, Speech 
at the annual central bank symposium in Jackson Hole, August. 
7  There is evidence of there having been an increase in skills mismatch both in the rightward shift of the euro-
area Beveridge curve and as indicated by skills mismatch indices. See Draghi (ibid.). 
8   Since 2007, annual average growth in participation rates has increased by 3 basis points for those between 
50 and  59  years  old  to  between  10  and  15  basis  points  (Table  1).  For  those  over  65,  the  increase  in 
participation  growth  rates  has  been  around  6  basis  points.  Growth  in  participation  rates  also  increased  by 
around 5 basis points for those in age cohorts between 35 and 49 since 2007.  
9  Banks  et  al  (2005)  find  that  those  in  (predominantly  final-salary)  employer  defined  benefit  plans  report 
chances of working at age 60 that are, on average, 3 percentage points lower than those of individuals in the 
State  Earnings-Related  Pension  Scheme  (SERPS),  an  average-earnings-based  defined  benefit  scheme. 
Those  with  defined contribution  pension  arrangements  report  probabilities  up  to  7 percentage points  higher 
than those in SERPSs. See Banks, J, Emmerson, C and Blundell, R (2005), “The balance between defined 
benefit,  defined  contribution,  and  state  provision”,  Journal  of  the  European  Economic  Association,  3(2–3): 
466–76.  
10  Cribb et al (2014) find that women’s employment rates at age 60 increased by around 7 percentage points 
when the state pension age was increased to 61. Male partners’ employment rates also increased – by around

  Reforms  to  the  UK’s  welfare  system,  including  attaching  job-search  conditions  to  welfare 
payments, could have prompted those affected to seek work.11 
Sharp falls in wealth and increased uncertainty about future incomes following the financial 
crisis have undoubtedly changed many people’s retirement plans, making them work longer 
and retire later in order to compensate.12 
And the scale of the debt accumulated by Britain’s households in the run-up to the recession 
has  encouraged  more  people  to  work,  and  to  work  longer.13  Around  40%  of  households 
reported being concerned about their levels of debt in 2013.14 Almost a tenth of households 
in a recent Bank of England survey said they were working more because of concerns about 
repaying their debt. 
So the strong performance of the UK labour market reflects in part people feeling compelled 
to work for financial or other reasons. 
When  British  workers  have  been  challenged,  they  have  not  given  up  (Charts  5–8).  Some 
have taken less productive or lower-skilled jobs. Others are working part-time. Some have 
become self-employed. Others are prepared to do the same work for less than they would 
have done. 
Wage pressures are, on past relationships, as low as if the unemployment rate were around 
10%, not the 6.4% it is today (Chart 9).15 
With more workers at competitive wages, companies have been encouraged to hire. They 
already had reason to favour labour over new capital investment given the higher cost and 
lower availability of credit following the financial crisis.16 
                                                                                                                                                   
4 percentage points – perhaps indicating a desire by couples to coordinate their retirement planning. Cribb, J, 
Emmerson,  C  and  Tetlow,  G  (2014),  “Incentives,  shocks  or  signals: labour  supply  effects  of  increasing  the 
female state pension age in the UK”, IFS Working Paper No. 13/03.  
11  For example, out-of-work lone parents with older children must now claim Job Seekers Allowance, a benefit 
with job search conditions attached, unlike previous Income Support. Consistent with these changes, Blundell 
et al (2014) find that participation and employment rates appear to have increased strongly (by 8–9%) among 
lone mothers who were affected by the 2010 changes. Blundell, R, Crawford, C and Jin, W (2014), “What can 
wages and employment tell us about the UK’s productivity puzzle?”, The Economic Journal, 124 (May). See 
also  Avram,  S,  Brewer,  M  and  Salvatori,  A  (2013),  “Lone  parent  obligations:  an  impact  assessment”, 
Department of Work and Pensions Research Report No. 845. 
12  Blundell et al (2014) examine the effects of the peak-to-trough wealth shocks implied by the financial crisis on 
older workers’ labour supply. They focus on individuals aged 55–74, and examine whether changes in wealth 
help  to  predict  future  employment  patterns  in  2010–11  given  employment  status  in  2006–7.  They  find 
evidence that shocks to housing wealth helped to predict employment status. For example, compared to the 
least affected 20% of men, the worst affected 20% of men were 14% more likely to be in work in 2010–1. The 
authors caution against taking too strong an interpretation of their results, however. For example, the regional 
house price indices used to calculate changes in housing wealth may be capturing wider regional variation in 
labour demand.  
13  Eggertson  and  Krugman  (2012)  illustrate  how  increased  labour  supply  is  one  margin  through  which 
households that need to de-lever can do so. Eggertson, G and Krugman, P, (2012), “Debt, deleveraging and

  This substitution of labour for capital across the economy has continued to lower productivity 
per hour worked. 
That weak productivity growth is not the result of laziness on anyone’s  part. It is a natural 
consequence of so many people wanting to work and companies employing them in place of 
capital. 
Since the typical economist asks whether what they have observed can work in theory, the 
annex  shows  how  a  “labour  supply  shock”  results  in  a  lower  path  for  real  wages  and 
productivity,  higher  employment,  and  greater  downward  pressure  on  wage  growth  at  any 
particular rate of unemployment. 
Although the adjustment has been painful, trading off lower productivity and wages for much 
higher employment, on balance it provides a solid foundation for a durable expansion. That is 
because keeping people in work through a recession maximises the prospects for individuals 
and the economy. 
By  staying  in  work,  individuals  retain  and  learn  new  skills.  And  they  are  better  placed  to 
participate in the expansion when it gathers force. This can make a material difference to an 
individual’s lifetime earnings.17 
For the economy, maintaining workforce attachment is the best way to ensure that cyclical 
downturns  in  aggregate  demand  for  goods  and  services  do  not  translate  into  permanent 
reductions in our economy’s potential to supply them. 
As a result, Britain has an opportunity, not often seen after a deep recession, to reach and 
sustain a higher level of employment than in the past. And workers can maximise their pay 
prospects. 
But, you rightly ask, when will this start? When will Britain get a pay rise? 
The expansion of labour supply does not mean permanently weak growth of real incomes. 
As employment approaches its new higher level, wage pressures should increase and capital 
investment  should  continue  to  recover.  Productivity  growth  should  pick  up  bringing  the 
higher, sustainable pay rises that British workers deserve.18 
Specifically,  the  Bank’s  latest  forecast  expects  real  wage  growth  to  resume  around  the 
middle  of  next  year  and  then  to  accelerate  as  the  unemployment  rate  continues  to  fall  to 
around 5½% over the next three years. 
By the end of our forecast, we see 4% nominal pay growth on average across the economy. 
This is consistent with our inflation target and the economy’s potential. I will touch at the end 
of my remarks on how workers and employers can raise that potential. 
But first let me turn to the implications of all these labour market developments for monetary 
policy. 
                                                
17  Oreopoulos et al (2012) estimate that a rise in unemployment by 5 percentage points implies an average initial 
loss of earnings for new college graduates of around 9 per cent, an effect which fades only after a decade. 
The persistent effects from adverse labour market conditions are much larger for individuals in the first year of 
their  careers  than  for  those  with  a  few  years  of  experience.  And  losses  are  magnified  for  those  whose 
earnings  are  predicted  to  be  lower,  based  on  their  college  major.  See  Oreopoulos,  P,  von Wachter,  T  and 
Heisz, A (2012), “The short- and long-term career effects of graduating in a recession”, American Economic 
Journal: Applied Economics, 4(1), pages 1–29. 
18  See Barnett, A, Batten, S, Chiu, A, Franklin, J, and Sebastia-Barriel, M (2014), “The UK productivity puzzle”, 
Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Q2, for an analysis of the UK’s “productivity puzzle”. The standard view 
has been that the UK has suffered from a collapse in the underlying growth rate of productivity. On that basis, 
we  would not expect there to be significant scope in future for either productivity or real wage growth.  The 
interpretation  of  the  recent  behaviour  of  the  labour  market  as  a  labour  supply  shock  has  more  positive 
implications for the future.

  Monetary policy implications 
3. 
One of our roles at the Bank of England is to deliver price stability in a way that supports jobs 
and growth. 
Our price stability objective is clear: the inflation target of 2% CPI inflation. 
Supporting  jobs  means  helping  the  economy  reach  the  maximum  sustainable  level  of 
employment. That level changes as the economy changes. 
That is why, a little more than a year ago, even though inflation had been above the target for 
most of the past five years and economic growth was poised to accelerate, we did not raise 
interest rates from their historic low level of ½%. 
We  did  not  because  we  recognised  that  the  UK  had  a  huge  number  of  unemployed  and 
under-employed  workers  and  that  the  economy  was  running  below  full  capacity.  We 
expected  inflation  to  fall  back.  We  saw  that  confidence  might  have  been  returning,  but  it 
remained fragile. We knew the nascent recovery was not yet secure. 
So  we  used  the  flexibility  in  our  remit,  given  to  us  by  Parliament,  to  return  inflation  to  the 
target over a longer period than usual in order to support sustainable jobs and growth. 
To  make  our  intentions  clear,  the  Bank  committed  not  to  even  think  about  raising  interest 
rates from historic lows at least until unemployment fell back to 7%. 
That guidance gave businesses the confidence to hire and invest. It reassured households 
that the  costs  of  servicing their  debts  were  not about  to rise  abruptly  at  a  time  when  they 
remained particularly sensitive to interest rates. And it evolved with the economy. 
The  effectiveness  of that  policy  has  been  reinforced  by  the  healing  of  the financial  sector. 
Prompted by the Bank of England, British banks have raised over £140 billion in new capital 
in  the  past  few  years.  They  are  right-sizing  their  balance  sheets  and  re-focussing  their 
businesses. 
The recovery has exceeded all expectations. It has momentum. There has been a sustained 
and sharp fall in the unemployment rate to 6.4%. Over 800,000 jobs have been created in 
the past year alone. We expect robust growth of 3½% this year and 3% in 2015. 
The challenge now is to secure a durable expansion; to make sure the economy realises its 
full potential. 
What does that mean for interest rates? 
With  many  of  the  conditions  for  the  economy  to  normalise  now  met,  the  point  at  which 
interest rates also begin to normalise is getting closer. In recent months the judgement about 
precisely when to raise Bank Rate has become more balanced. 
We have no pre-set course, however; the timing will depend on the data. 
Moreover, the precise timing of the first rate rise is less important than our expectation that, 
when rates do begin to rise, those increases are likely to be gradual and limited. Rates will 
go  up  only  as  far  and  as  fast  as  is  consistent  with  price  stability  as  part  of  a  durable 
expansion, with the maximum sustainable level of employment. 
For a variety of reasons ranging from the weakness in the euro area, to ongoing repair of 
household  balance  sheets,  we  are  not  expecting  interest  rates  to  head  back  to  the  levels 
seen before the Great Recession.19 
The  actual  path  of  interest  rates  will  be  determined  by  the  evolution  of  the  balance  of 
aggregate demand and aggregate supply.

  Before  the  crisis,  monetary  policy  largely  tracked  developments  in  aggregate  demand 
because  the  structural  dynamics  of  labour  supply  and  productivity  growth  were  relatively 
consistent.20 But in the wake of the crisis, the supply side of the economy has been anything 
but predictable. 
Originally, we thought the major uncertainties were centred on productivity growth. 
But  as  the  Bank’s  Monetary  Policy  Committee  (MPC)  has  seen  wages,  employment  and 
productivity  evolve,  we  are  increasingly  of  the  view  that  there  has  been  a  material  labour 
supply shock for the reasons that I have discussed. 
So we have been paying increasingly close attention to developments in the labour market. 
Our forecasts for the next three years, and hence our interest rate decisions, are based on 
key judgements that: 
• 
the number of people participating in the labour force will continue to rise, reaching 
64% of the population later in the year and continuing its upward trend of the past 
decade; 
the  unemployment  rate 
the  economy  can  sustain  without  generating 
accelerating inflation will return to where it was before the Great Recession (around 
5%), and, at around 5½% now, is currently only a little above that; and 
there is scope for the average hours people work to increase further, reducing by 
about half the current gap between actual and reported desired hours. 
  that 
In short, and unlike the US and euro area, the economy is likely to be able to sustain a higher 
level  of  employment  than  in  the  past.  The  uncertainty  is  less  the  direction  of  that 
development and more its magnitude. 
To  assess  that  magnitude  and  its  implications  for  inflation,  we  are  tracking  a  range  of 
indicators, including those of the prospective paths for wages and unit labour costs. 
Actual  wage  growth,  at  just  0.6%  since  a  year  ago  excluding  bonuses,  is  currently  very 
weak.21  However,  there  are  some  leading  indicators  that  point  to  a  modest  pick  up  over 
coming quarters. 
For  example,  job-to-job  flows  have  been  increasing  (Chart  11)  and  some  surveys  of  pay 
growth have picked up more sharply in the last year. Although the relationship between these 
surveys and average wage growth has become less robust in recent years (Chart 12), they 
do offer encouraging evidence of better wage prospects for those changing or finding new 
jobs. 
Of course, the pay of existing employees needs to pick up as well. After all, what matters for 
economy-wide inflation is the average wage relative to economy-wide productivity.22 To that 
end, we will be closely monitoring pay settlements that are bunched around the turn of the 
year and taking a steer from the pay of new hires as a potential leading indicator of broader 
pay pressures. 
Some observers have discounted the implications for inflation of the recent weakness of pay 
growth  because  it  stems  from  the  types  of  jobs  being  filled  –  a  “compositional  effect”. 
However,  these  are  real  jobs  being  performed  by  real  people,  and  an  increase  in  lower-
skilled lower-wage jobs is one consequence of working-off the labour supply shock. We also 
                                                
20  See Broadbent (2014). 
21  According to the ONS AWE measure, pay excluding bonuses for employees in the economy as a whole was 
0.6%  higher  than  a  year  earlier.  Including  bonuses,  pay  growth  was  –0.2%.  In  the  private  sector,  the 
equivalent figures were 0.9% (excluding bonuses) and –0.1% (including bonuses). 
22  It is the average of real unit labour costs across firms in the economy that matters for inflation.

  need to be mindful of the possibility that it represents part of a longer-term trend towards job 
polarisation. 
What  matters  for  inflationary  pressures,  irrespective  of  the  type  of  job,  is  the  relationship 
between  wages  and  productivity,  as  captured  by  unit  labour  costs.  Across  the  economy, 
wage growth is barely above productivity growth. Unit labour costs are currently soft (growing 
at only around 1% in the economy as a whole), are below the growth rate necessary to meet 
the  inflation  target,  and  indicate  that  there  is  further  to  go  before  we  reach  the  new 
sustainable level of employment. 
In other words, there is still slack in the labour market that must be used up, and the recent 
revisions  to  the  profile  of  UK  output  up  to  2012  seem  unlikely  to  change  that  assessment 
materially. That slack is wasteful. And if it were to remain, inflation would remain below the 
2% target. 
The MPC’s current best collective judgement is that, while it has narrowed rapidly, this slack 
is broadly in the region of 1% of GDP. As this margin of slack continues to narrow, we expect 
wages  to  pick  up  slightly  faster  than  productivity,  and  unit  labour  cost  growth  should 
increase, consistent with meeting the inflation target. 
However, the MPC expects it will take the better part of three years for this to happen. 
With inflation at 1.6%, continuing downward pressure from the appreciation of sterling, and 
with slack remaining, the current inflation environment is benign. But it will not remain benign 
if  we  do  not  increase  interest  rates  prudently  as  the  expansion  progresses.  Our  latest 
forecasts show that, if interest rates were to follow the path expected by markets – that is, 
beginning  to  increase  by  the  spring  and  thereafter  rising  very  gradually  –  inflation  would 
settle at around 2% by the end of the forecast and a further 1.2 million jobs would have been 
created. 
In other words, we would achieve our mandate. 
There is, as always, uncertainty about the future. 
But uncertainty does not mean stasis. You can expect interest rates to begin to increase. 
The exact path will depend on the economy. Our assessment will undoubtedly change as the 
economy evolves and policy will of course be adjusted if geopolitical events have a material 
impact on the outlook. 
If  indicators  suggest  the  economy  is  moving  more  slowly  towards  our  goals,  we  will  have 
learned that we are further from sustainable capacity. Prospective wage and unit labour cost 
growth will be weaker. Rates will go up later and more gradually. 
And  should  we  see  faster  progress,  prospective  wage  and  unit  labour  cost  growth  will  be 
stronger, which will suggest we are closer to maximum capacity and that the economy can 
sustain higher rates sooner. 
In  all  events,  rate  rises  can  be  expected  to  be  gradual  and  limited  compared  to  the 
experience of the UK in the past. 
Conclusion 
4. 
We  are  under  no  illusions.  The  Great  Recession  was  a  calamity.  Britain’s  workers  have 
borne many of the consequences. 
Our job is to ensure the economy achieves its potential and to maintain price and financial 
stability, for sustainable growth in jobs and incomes. 
But monetary policy cannot do it alone. 
Others – including trade unions, government and businesses – will determine the potential of 
this economy. You will ultimately determine the size of Britain’s pay rise.

  Those in work need to be able to seize new job opportunities in a world where technology 
and globalisation cause labour markets to shift rapidly. 
Skill  levels  need  to  be  raised  continually.  That  is  of  course  first  and  foremost  about 
education.  But  crucially  it  also  means  access  to  lifelong  learning,  both  on  and  off  the  job, 
available to all. 
The TUC’s engagement with the UK’s skills agenda is a major contribution to realising that 
imperative. In the past year alone, unionlearn, has supported over 200,000 people to invest 
in their skills. 
Such investments are crucial for the durability of this economic expansion and for Britain’s 
future. They will help to deliver long-term productivity – so that the British people get the pay 
rise they deserve.

Appendix: stylised description of labour market dynamics 
This appendix sets out a stylized description of recent labour market dynamics derived from 
a simple model. 
First, suppose firms employ labour 𝑁 to produce output 𝑌=𝑁1−𝛼, where 1−𝛼 is the labour 
share of income. Firms pay a real wage of 𝑊. As a result, they demand labour up to the point 
𝑤=𝑦−𝑛 
Equation (LD) is the labour demand curve. For given final demand, 𝑦, labour demand is a 
decreasing function of the real wage, 𝑤. 
𝑤=𝜑𝑛 
governed by the (inverse) Frisch elasticity 𝜑. 
Second,  households  supply  labour,  trading  off  the  disutility  of  working  more  with  the  extra 
consumption higher wage income brings. The simplest resulting labour supply curve is: 
The  two  curves  LS  and  LD  deliver  labour  market  equilibrium  real  wage  and  employment. 
That is illustrated in Figure 1. 
This  condition  says  that  households  supply  more  labour  when  the  real  wage  is  high,

   can be derived: 
𝜋𝑤−𝛽𝐸𝜋+1𝑤 =−𝜆𝜑(𝑢−𝑢�) 
Weak wage growth 
With  some  additional  structure,  the  simple  model  above  can  be  used  to  understand 
unemployment and wage inflation.23 If wages are adjusted infrequently (ie there is nominal 
wage stickiness), then the following relation between wage inflation, 𝜋𝑤, and unemployment 
where 𝛽𝐸𝜋+1𝑤  captures expected inflation, 𝑢� is the ‘natural’ rate of unemployment (which can 
vary  over  time)  and 𝜆  is  a  parameter  capturing  the  degree  of  wage  stickiness.  Equation 
(WPC) is the Wage Phillips Curve. For a given natural rate of unemployment, WPC traces 
out the relationship between wage growth and unemployment. Chart 9 contains a reduced-
form representation of the WPC, taken from Broadbent (2014). 
As that chart shows, outturns for wages in 2013 and 2014 were considerably below the past 
relationship,  which  would  otherwise  suggest  that  unemployment  would  be  expected  to  be 
around  10% given  the  observed  decline  in  wages.  In  light  of  equation  (WPC),  one  way  to 
interpret this is as there having been a decline in 𝑢�, the natural rate, such that a given rate of 
unemployment  puts  greater  downward  pressure  on  wages.  Broadbent  (2014)  discusses 
Chart 9 further.
