  Rodrigo Vergara: Chile’s September 2014 Monetary Policy Report 
Presentation by Mr Rodrigo Vergara, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, of the Monetary 
Policy Report before the Honorable Senate of the Republic, Santiago de Chile, 3 September 
2014.

 Introduction 
Mr.  Vice-president  of  the  Senate,  Senator  Eugenio  Tuma,  honorable  senators,  ladies, 
gentlemen, 
Thank  you  for  your  invitation  to  the  Board  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile  to  present  our 
Monetary  Policy  Report.  As  is  the  norm  each  September,  this  Report  coincides  with  the 
annual report from the Central Bank Board to the Senate, where we share our vision on the 
recent  macroeconomic  and  financial  developments  in  Chile  and  abroad,  as  well  as  their 
prospects and implications for monetary policy conduct. 
Chile’s  economic  outlook  has  seen  important  changes  over  the  past  few  months.  In 
particular,  the  slowdown  in  output  has  been  more  pronounced  than  anticipated  and  is 
expected to be also more persistent. A year ago, when we came to the Senate to present our 
vision of what would be the economy in 2014, we projected that it would expand in the 4 to 
5 percent range. Today, as I will detail in a moment, we estimate that growth will be between 
1.75 and 2.25 percent this year and between 3 and 4 percent in 2015, that is, less than our 
estimate for medium-term growth in our economy. 
This sharp deceleration is certainly worrying news, that should move us all, from political and 
economic  venues,  to  combine  our  best  efforts  to  restore  the  dynamism  of  the  Chilean 
economy, especially considering that, as is our conviction, Chile has all the necessary tools 
at hand to ensure higher growth and thus improve the welfare of its inhabitants. 
In this context, the Central Bank has used monetary policy decisively and consistently with its 
mandate,  always  directing  its  efforts  to  achieving  the  price  stability  objective. We  are  also 
aware that monetary policy tools, however powerful, can smooth, but never flatten out, the 
economy’s cyclical fluctuations. 
What  are  the  elements  behind  this  weak  economic  growth?  Our  research  identifies  some 
factors that to some degree were expected – we have mentioned them in earlier Reports – 
and some unexpected ones, with effects that are yet to be assessed with accuracy. 
The expected factors include external developments. Chile is a small, open economy and, as 
such, is affected by the vagaries of the world economy. In this sense, and beyond the severe 
negative effects of the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, we must recognize that during the 
past  decade  the  Chilean  economy  was  blessed  with  a  benign  international  scenario,  with 
extraordinarily advantageous commodity prices and financial conditions. 
Notwithstanding,  lately  the  high  commodity  price  cycle  has  come  to  an  end,  hitting 
commodity-exporting  countries  including  Chile.  Meanwhile,  although  international  financial 
conditions  are  still  good,  the  process  of  monetary  policy  normalization  in  some  large 
developed economies is expected to begin soon. 
We must not forget that copper, our main export, traded at nearly 4 dollars per pound for an 
extended  period,  and  now  it  is  closer  to  3  dollars  and  may  fall  further  in  the  long  term. 
Moreover,  during  the  last  decade,  coincidentally  with  higher  prices  and  supply  shortages, 
investments in mining have increased significantly around the world. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

  Chile was no exception. During the 1990s and early 2000s, mining investment averaged 2 to 
3 points of the country’s GDP. Between 2006 and 2013, this figure rose to 5 points of GDP, 
peaking in 2012 at 6.5 percent of GDP. This phenomenon not only allowed the country to 
enlarge its mining capacity, but also created major productive linkages toward other sectors, 
including construction, trade, and manufacturing industries. 
The north of our country, especially cities such as Iquique, Antofagasta, and La Serena, has 
seen  strong  development  and  growth  thanks  to  the  positive  impact  of  this  phenomenon. 
However, this investment cycle, as has been noted on numerous occasions, has entered a 
matured stage, resulting in a decline in the number of projects under way. This is also true of 
other metal-exporting economies like Australia and Peru, although differing in intensity and 
timing, and is symptomatic of this phenomenon. 
However, the aforementioned maturation of the global cycle of copper investment is not the 
only  reason  behind  the  slowdown  in  mining  investment.  Delays,  postponements  and 
cancellations have also been attributed by industry participants to domestic problems related 
to water shortages and high energy costs, to excessive delay in the definition of projects and 
legal  issues  with  some  of  them,  as  well  as  to  problems  with  communities  and  increased 
costs. 
Among the factors behind the deceleration, there is also the fact that reconstruction works 
after  the  earthquake  and  tsunami  of  February  2010,  including  the  associated  fiscal  boost, 
have  tended  to  recede  as  the  process  is  completed,  explaining  also  part  of  the  economic 
slowdown. Last, but not least, in the past few years, these and other factors have pushed 
economic  growth  above  its  potential.  This  made  it  necessary  and  appropriate  to  pursue  a 
slower pace of growth, more sustainable over time. 
Overall,  output  and  expenditure  have  weakened  beyond  expectations,  taking  us  and  all 
economic agents by surprise for the intensity and persistence of the slowdown. Already in 
last June’s Report we said that part of the drop in investment could not be attributed to the 
variables that traditionally determine this component of domestic demand. 
The negative surprise in output has to do with some of the developments that we envisioned 
a  few  months  ago  contributing  less  to  growth  than  we  thought  then.  For  example,  the 
economic recovery of our main trading partners has been somewhat slower than expected, 
especially in Latin America. Downward corrections to mining and energy investment projects 
planned for 2014 have been sharper than estimated, as reflected in the latest survey of the 
Capital Goods Corporation. In addition, the depreciation of our peso, although an important 
incentive  for  the  export  sector,  in  the  short  term  has  negatively  affected  the  imported 
components of domestic expenditure. 
Along  with  this,  it  is  worth  noting  the  decline  in  economic  expectations  in  recent  months, 
which, on one hand, are a reflection of this scenario of slower growth, but on the other, may 
end up negatively affecting domestic demand. Expectations for investment and consumption 
have been falling for quite some time already, and more sharply in the most recent past. The 
Economic Perceptions Index (IPEC) and the Monthly Business Confidence Indicator (IMCE) 
have posted continuous declines this year. As of July, the two are below their neutral levels 
(figure 1). 
Besides,  they  show  significant  deterioration  in  some  specific  items,  most  notably  those 
related with the convenience of buying durable goods, the perception about employment and 
the appropriate level of inventories. Meanwhile, the Business Perceptions Report published 
by  the  Bank  in  August  revealed  that  firms  perceive  an  increase  in  uncertainty,  which  has 
influenced both their own and their customers’ investment and spending decisions. Increased 
uncertainty  naturally  results  in  investment  projects  being  pushed  back  (the  “wait-and-see” 
option in specialized jargon), which could partly explain the reduction in investment. 
As  I  said,  monetary  policy  has  responded  strongly  and  decisively  to  the  worsening  of  our 
domestic scenario, generating significant monetary impulse. By mid-2013 we expressed the 
2 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  need to adopt a more expansionary monetary stance that would ensure that inflation would 
converge to the target. Accordingly, since October last year we have lowered the monetary 
policy rate (MPR) by 150 basis points, keeping an expansionary bias for monetary policy. 
This, together with the performance of the internal and external macroeconomic scenarios, 
has heavily affected the structure of market interest rates. In particular, long-term rates are in 
or close to their all-time lows (figure 2). I must stress this because long-term interest rates 
are the ones that most influence investment. What is remarkable is that today they are even 
below the rates prevailing in 2008–2009, that is, even lower than they were at the height of 
the  global  financial  crisis,  when  the  MPR  was  down  to  0.5  percent  and  unconventional 
monetary stimulus had to be added to the economy. Mortgage lending interest rates are also 
below where they were at the time and very close to their historic lows. 
At the same time, the lower cost of bank funding has been transmitted to the lending rates 
faced  by  firms  and  households.  These  rates  have  fallen  by  as  much  as  140  basis  points 
since October last year. However, adjusted for inflation, lending has decelerated, particularly 
in  commercial  and  consumer  loans,  influenced  by  the  more  cautious  behavior  of  both 
suppliers and demanders of credit, as is apparent in our June Bank Lending Survey (BLS) 
and our August’s Business Perceptions Report (IPN). 
The cuts we have already made to the MPR have helped to smooth the business cycle, and, 
as we have mentioned before and now again in the Report I am presenting, a still stronger 
monetary  impulse  will  likely  be  necessary  in  order  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  inflation 
target. In particular, given the present conditions, and barring a big change in the economic 
scenario,  we  believe  that  the  monetary  policy  adjustments  the  market  expects,  which  are 
implicit in the various expectations indicators at the closing of this Report – end of August – , 
will suffice to achieve the inflation target and help revive our economy. 
Monetary policy is an important and significant tool to tone down the cyclical fluctuations of 
the economy. Its countercyclical use is a privilege that we have earned after years of policy 
conduct that has strengthened the credibility of the Central Bank. But it is also important to 
note  that  powerful  does  not  mean  almighty.  It  allows  to  mitigate,  but  not  fully  offset,  the 
natural  fluctuations  of  a  small,  open  economy  like  Chile.  More  importantly,  if  we  wish  the 
Chilean economy to attain higher growth rates in the medium term, it will be necessary to 
implement  measures  to  encourage  investment  in  both  physical  and  human  capital  and 
promote  productivity  growth,  all  elements  which,  incidentally,  are  beyond  the  scope  of 
monetary policy. 
This  Monetary  Policy  Report  contains  a  revision  by  the  Board  to  its  medium-term  growth 
assumption for Chile over the coming years. This assumption is important from the point of 
view  of  monetary  policy  because,  combined  with  other  elements,  it  allows  to  estimate  the 
size of capacity gaps and the resulting inflationary pressures. After assessing all the data at 
hand, we estimate that Chile’s medium-term growth is in the 4 to 4.5 percent range, less than 
we previously thought. The slower growth foreseen in investment and total factor productivity 
explain a large part of this revision. 
Medium-term growth declines are a natural process as the economy attains higher per capita 
income levels. Still, we believe that Chile has available some measures that could moderate 
this  phenomenon.  As I said,  part  of the  revision  has  to  do  with  the  expected  slowdown  in 
investment. One argument that is usually put forward to explain the lower investment is rising 
energy costs and difficulties to materialize investments, despite having all permits required 
by the relevant institutions. 
From the Central Bank we have stressed time and again how important it is for the country’s 
development to have well-defined policies that will allow over time to cut down the cost of 
such an important input. The Government recently launched an energy agenda with certainly 
ambitious goals, and hopefully we will see advances in that direction, which should translate 
into  further  development  of  our  country.  Another  way  to  raise  our  potential  output  is  by 
investing in infrastructure works. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

  In the past few years, our economy has shown a decline in total factor productivity. The two 
policies  I  just  mentioned  –  energy  and  infrastructure  –  ,  aside  from  their  incidence  in 
investment, could also result in higher productivity. 
Regarding  employment,  a  recurrent  topic  in  our  country’s  policy  debates  is  female 
participation  in  the  workforce.  Despite  some  increases  in  recent  years,  it  is  still  below  the 
average of OECD economies (figure 3). As our population ages and grows at a slower pace, 
the  larger  female  labor  force  participation  can  be  a  significant  ingredient  to  boost  our 
medium-term  growth.  Another  ingredient  could  be  extending  the  working  life  span  of 
individuals, a trend that is gaining importance in many countries as the fraction of population 
over 65 is growing rapidly and is still able to contribute their bit to the economy. Finally, the 
challenges relating to increasing labor productivity that everybody recognizes are mainly to 
improve our educational and training systems. 
Now,  let  me  describe  the  macroeconomic  scenario  that  we  see  as  the  most  likely  for  the 
coming quarters, and its associated risks. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
Annual headline inflation has remained above 4 percent, but with moderate variations in the 
past few months. This was more visible in the evolution of the CPIEFE – the CPI excluding 
food goods and energy prices – reflecting, on one hand, that the pass-through of the peso 
depreciation to inflation has been a significant development, but declining in intensity as time 
passes and, on the other, that the weak performance of the economy is already easing the 
pressure  on  prices.  Accordingly,  we  continue  to  estimate  that  the  current  high  level  of 
inflation will be temporary, a vision that is shared by market agents, as inflation expectations 
one and two years ahead have remained around 3 percent (figure 4). 
As I said at the beginning, the biggest news in several months comes from domestic demand 
and  output,  which  posted  a  quite  weaker  performance  than  our  forecasts.  In  the  second 
quarter  GDP  grew  1.9  percent  while  domestic  demand  dropped  0.9  percent  annually 
(figure 5).  Expenditure’s  poor  performance  permeated  its  every  component,  where  worth 
noting  was  the  fast  deterioration  of  the  most  persistent  ones,  such  as  non-durable 
consumption  and  investment  in  construction  and  engineering  works.  By  sectors,  trade, 
especially wholesale, fell in annual terms, while a large number of manufacturing branches 
posted  meager  results.  Only  those  most  linked to  the  export  sector  show  marginally  more 
favorable figures. 
The  evolution  of  expenditure  has  also  driven  a  reduction  in  imports,  causing  a  sharper 
adjustment to the current account (figure 6). In fact, while a year ago the annual deficit of the 
current account amounted to 4 percent of GDP and was expected to increase further, at the 
end of the second quarter it was at 2.4 percent of GDP and is now expected to end the year 
at 1.8 percent of GDP. This level, plus the peso depreciation and its effects on exports, mean 
that we can look at this variable’s future behavior with ease. 
Early third-quarter partial indicators show a still weak economy, but we must not overreact to 
monthly data, which tends to be very volatile (figure 7). Thus, we must not be surprised if our 
growth  figures  remain  low  because,  as  I  said,  we  are  experiencing  a  process  of  sharper, 
more persistent economic slowdown. In this sense, our growth forecast revision for this year 
takes  this  into  account and  assumes  that,  towards  the  end  of this  year,  we  will  see  some 
recovery, though small and gradual. 
Turning to the labor market, the unemployment rate is slightly higher than early in the year, 
but still low by historic standards. Total employment continues to rise in annual terms, but at 
a  slower  pace,  and  the  salaried  component  has  been  stagnant  for  some  months.  Other 
indicators,  such  as  available  job  vacancies,  have  dropped  and  unemployment  insurance 
claims have increased (figure 8). Thus, it is natural to expect a rise in the unemployment rate 
in  the  coming  months.  Still,  nominal  wages  continue  to  grow,  which  could  delay  the 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  convergence of inflation and hinder the adjustment of the labor market to the current cyclical 
conditions of our economy. 
As I mentioned, the worsening of our domestic economy has occurred within a context where 
the monetary impulse has increased substantially. We have cut 150 basis points off the MPR 
in the past year and the market interest rate structure has diminished accordingly. 
The change in the macroeconomic scenario has also reflected in exchange rate movements, 
in  both  nominal  and  real  terms.  The  CLP  posted  a  5.8  percent  depreciation  between  the 
close  of  this  Report  and  last,  mostly  during  the  past  few  weeks.  Although  part  of  this 
depreciation  responded  to  the  global  strengthening  of  the  dollar,  the  rise  in  the  CLP/USD 
parity  exceeded  that  of  other  emerging  market  currencies.  This  obeyed  to  less  favorable 
cyclical conditions and a more expansionary monetary policy in the country. It must be noted 
that  Chile’s  macroeconomic  policy  framework  includes,  among  other  features,  a  monetary 
policy  based  on  inflation  targeting  and  exchange  rate  flexibility.  Thus,  during  slowdown 
periods,  when  the  pressure  on  prices  diminishes,  policy  becomes  more  expansionary  in 
order to achieve the inflation target, that is, for the inflation rate not to fall below the target 
range. 
This boost to monetary policy results in a higher exchange rate, which permits the economy 
to have a faster, optimal adjustment via the expansion of tradable sectors. In other words, 
the exchange rate increases are a natural, desired response to the business cycle, lending a 
helping  hand  in  the  economic  adjustment.  We  have  been  faithful  to  this  predicament,  as 
reflected in the significant depreciation of our currency in recent times. We do not view this 
as a problem, because despite some unwanted effects in the short term – including higher 
inflation – it is part of the solution to have the economy reactivate more rapidly and efficiently. 
We have stressed, also, how Chile’s interest rates have adjusted significantly downward in 
this scenario. This contrasts sharply with what would occur in other times or today in other 
emerging  economies,  where  exchange  rate  pressures  would  rapidly  translate  into  higher 
interest rates. 
External  credit  conditions,  aside from temporary  ups  and  downs,  have  remained favorable 
from  a  historic  perspective,  although  the  risk  of  a  reversal  is  still  present.  Lately,  Chile’s 
sovereign and corporate risk premiums have increased somewhat, but are still below their 
year-ago  levels.  The  situation  is  similar  in  other  emerging  economies.  Long-term  interest 
rates have receded in the developed world since June, with unprecedented performance in 
the case of the U.S. given its stronger economy and expectations that the benchmark rate 
will begin to rise by the middle of next year. 
The terms of trade have also been favorable since June, and they even increased marginally 
with  respect to  June’s forecasts, mainly  owing  to  a  higher  copper  price  because  of  tighter 
supply.  The  baseline  scenario  works  with  a  copper  price  forecast  of  315  dollar  cents  per 
pound in 2014 and 305 in 2015. 
The growth outlook of our trading partners lost some strength since June, and we continue to 
expect higher growth in 2015 than in 2014. In the developed economies, growth has been 
slightly  revised  downward  for  this  year.  The  worsened  figures  in  Japan  combined  with  a 
slower  recovery  in  the  Eurozone,  Germany  included,  where  consumer  and  business 
confidence has declined, partly because of the geopolitical conflicts in the region. The United 
States regained strength in the second quarter, thanks to the good performance of private 
consumption and investment, and better expectations. In Latin America, the growth forecast 
has been lowered for this year and next in most countries, although with some heterogeneity. 
In  China,  government  policies  have  managed  to  stabilize  growth.  Our  baseline  scenario 
assumes that our trading partners will grow an average 3.6 percent in 2014 and 2015, two 
tenths of a point less than foreseen in June (table 1). 
The  baseline  scenario  assumes  that  the  slowdown  in  the  domestic  economy  will  be  more 
persistent than previously expected. Thus, as anticipated, the GDP growth forecast for this 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 5 
  year  is  adjusted  to  between  1.75  and  2.25  percent,  below  the  June  estimate.  In  2015, 
consistently  with  the  low  basis  of  comparison  and  limited  economic  dynamism,  we  expect 
GDP  to  grow  between  3.0  and  4.0  percent  annually.  The  recovery,  though  moderate,  is 
based  on  a  greater  monetary  stimulus  and  lower  market  interest  rates;  stronger  fiscal 
stimulus; increased trading partners’ growth; a real depreciation of the peso; and improved 
private  expectations.  As  already  noted,  for  this  projection,  the  Board  assumes  that  the 
medium-term growth of the Chilean economy is between 4 and 4.5 percent. 
The  domestic  demand  growth  forecast  for  2014  has  also  been  corrected  downward, 
particularly for investment. This change responds to actual second-quarter indicators that fell 
short of the forecast, and to the Capital Goods Corporation’s investment projects that were 
revised downward in the last survey. In contrast, a stronger impulse from public expenditure 
is expected, particularly from investment. On the private consumption side, we expect it to 
keep growing for the rest of the year at a slower pace than was forecast in June (table 2). 
Annual CPI inflation, still affected by high monthly variations early in the year and the direct 
effects  of  the  recent  depreciation  of  the  peso  will  remain  above  4  percent  throughout  the 
remainder  of  2014.  By  2015,  in  line  with  the  lower  inflationary  pressures  that  are  inferred 
from the cyclic evolution of the economy and the high basis of comparison, annual inflation of 
both  the  CPI  and  the  CPIEFE  will  have  a  quick  descent  to  3  percent.  Then  it  will  hover 
around  3  percent  until  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon,  this  time  the  third  quarter  of  2016 
(figure 9). 
This  inflation trajectory  is  based  on the  assumption  that the  indirect  effects  of  the  nominal 
and  real  depreciation  of  our  currency  will  be  more  than  offset  by  the  state  of  the  capacity 
gaps over the projection horizon. The Board’s assessment yields that the current level of the 
real exchange rate (RER) is consistent with the cyclical state of the economy and the internal 
and external financial conditions, although it is slightly above the range of its estimated long-
term values. As a methodological assumption, it considers that the exchange rate will have a 
slight appreciation in real terms over the long run, as the cyclical conditions of our economy 
normalize. 
About  the  MPR,  the  changes  in  the  domestic  macroeconomic  scenario  have  lowered  its 
expected level compared with June. As a working assumption, we estimate that the MPR will 
follow  a  path  comparable  with  what  can  be  inferred  with  different  expectations  measures 
available  at  the  closing  of  this  Report.  These  measures  suggest  that  the  MPR  will  see 
additional cuts going forward, that will take it to the vicinity of 3 percent before the end of the 
year (figure 10). 
The baseline scenario reflects those events that are estimated to be the most likely to occur 
with the information at hand at the closing of this Report. There are risk scenarios, however, 
which  if  materialized,  may  reshape  the  macroeconomic  environment  and,  therefore,  may 
modify the course of monetary policy. On this opportunity, having evaluated the alternative 
scenarios, the Board estimates that the risk balance for inflation is unbiased, and for output it 
is unbiased in 2014 and downward biased in 2015. 
Abroad, the risks foreseen in earlier Reports remain. Although the growth outlook in China 
has stabilized lately, its future performance continues to pose a risk, particularly relating to 
the  Chinese  financial  system  and  real  estate  sector.  Moreover,  we  cannot  rule  out  that 
vulnerabilities in other emerging economies may originate new episodes of volatility. In the 
Eurozone,  the macrofinancial  situation  continues  to  create  uncertainty, which  compounded 
with  geopolitical  tensions  in  the  continent  aggravates  the  risk  of  a  slower  recovery  in  the 
region. 
In  the  United  States,  the  tapering  of  unconventional  monetary  stimulus  has  proceeded  as 
expected,  but  the financial  markets  could  suffer significant  stress  episodes  if  events  occur 
that  might  anticipate  the  timing  of  the  announced  increases  in  the  Fed  funds  rate.  In 
particular,  in  the  present  context  of  low  long-term  interest  rates  and  limited  sovereign 
premiums,  there  could  be  a  drastic  reversal  causing  important  tension.  This  could  have 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  effects  on  external  funding  costs  and  currency  parities,  with  a  heavy  impact  on  emerging 
economies. Overall, the most likely scenario continues to assume that the US economy will 
bring a new boost from abroad and a more favorable scenario in the medium term. 
At home, one risk is domestic output and demand growing less than expected. As noted, the 
two  have  weakened  beyond  projections,  coinciding  with  a  widespread  worsening  of 
expectations.  The  baseline  scenario  estimates  that  this  worsening  will  reverse  gradually, 
which partly explains the growth forecast for consumption and investment in 2015. However, 
if such reversal does not occur, there may be a sharper and stronger adjustment in the labor 
market, which would negatively affect consumption and output. Furthermore, a worsening of 
business expectations could intensify the investment adjustment. 
Such  a  setting  could  also  trigger  a  more  intense  rebalancing  towards  the  tradable  sector, 
thus moderating the domestic slowdown. Meanwhile, although a weaker domestic economy 
could  amplify  capacity  gaps  and  ease  inflationary  pressures,  we  cannot  rule  out  that  its 
effects on the exchange rate may offset the price effects, at least temporarily, thus delaying 
the convergence of inflation. 
Let me now share with you some concluding thoughts. 
Final thoughts 
Domestic  output  and  demand  have  been  weaker,  and  more  persistently  so,  than  we 
expected  a  few  months  back.  The  sharper  fall  in  investment  coupled  with  a  more  marked 
deceleration of private consumption, so we lowered our growth forecast for this year below 
the  range  we  projected  in  June.  Annual  inflation,  on  the  contrary,  has  been  in  line  with 
expectations and we continue to see its present high level as temporary. As from June, the 
Bank has cut the monetary policy rate by 50 basis points, taking it to 3.5 percent, and has 
reiterated that it will consider the possibility of making further reductions to the MPR in line 
with the evolution of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions and its implications on 
the inflationary outlook. 
No  doubt  the  results  and  projections  presented  today  show  a  weak  performance  of  the 
Chilean economy. We have made significant corrections to our output forecast that respond 
to  the  combination  of  external  and  internal  factors,  some  of  them  foreseen,  some 
unexpected. Within the latter, it is obvious that the widespread deterioration of private sector 
expectations  has  played  a  major  role.  The  true  magnitude  of  such  role  is  difficult  to 
determine, but it is certainly big, particularly when it comes to projections. 
Monetary policy has played its part and it will continue to do so, by adding momentum, but it 
cannot be expected to solve every problem of our economy by itself. As I said, the medium-
term  growth  we  see  today  as  the  most  likely  is  less  than  what  we  thought  a  while  ago. 
Factors  like  the  reduction  in  investment  projects,  the  decline  in  productivity,  some 
demographic  issues  and  the  convergence  to  higher  per  capita  income  are  behind  this 
change. And there are structural factors that we could potentiate in order to sustain higher 
medium-term growth in the country. 
Chile’s advances in the last thirty years are huge. Poverty indexes have dropped dramatically 
and we have improved our living conditions remarkably. The key to our success has been 
the solid base that we have built with the combined efforts of each and every Chilean citizen. 
But there is still a lot to be done. Alongside our development over these three decades stand 
die-hard inequalities that we have failed to resolve as a society. In a way, this is one of the 
problems that come with our very success. The society – notably our growing middle class – 
demands ever more and better services, along with more opportunities. As a rule, these are 
legitimate  demands,  which  must  be  met  with  policies  that  prevent  losing  what  we  have 
gained and entangling us in a dead end situation. This is called the “middle-income trap” in 
the literature.

  I am an optimist, and I am convinced that our country has the right institutions to help us out 
of these challenging times. Over the years we have combined our efforts to make reforms, 
that  are  deep  and  long-lasting.  Actually,  our  country  is  recognized  around  the  world, 
precisely for its strong institutions. The capacity of our leaders to reach agreements is proof 
of  such  strength  and,  therefore,  we  have  appreciated  the  agreement  led  by  the  Finance 
minister, Congress representatives and political leaders around the tax reform. 
The question we must ask ourselves, putting aside our individual positions, is how we can all 
move forward to create a better country. Naturally, discrepancies will arise about the reasons 
for the slowdown. We believe, however, that a fruitful use for our time is to think about ways 
to reactivate our economy and, more importantly, how to boost growth into the medium to 
long term. 
Beware also with being over-optimistic or over-pessimistic. When things go well we see no 
limit  and  indulge  in  the  we-are-so-good  fantasy.  But  when  the  table  turns  we  become 
pessimistic and see no possible solution. It’s neither this nor that. The country we have built, 
though not perfect, is an example among emerging economies. There is a long way ahead, 
but let us not underestimate what we have achieved. 
Mistrust will not bring the solution. The only way is to work hand in hand, which is what has 
brought us so many good results as a society. Aside from cyclical factors, where there are 
elements  beyond  our  control,  attaining  higher  stages  of  development  in  a  broad  sense, 
depends  upon  us.  Among  the  many  challenges  noted  by  numerous  studies  are  to  reduce 
energy costs, improve infrastructure and provide quality education. Our objective is not only 
to boost growth; it must also guarantee that the benefits are felt by every individual. 
We, as the Central Bank, have reiterated our commitment with price stability, stating that we 
will take every step necessary for the inflation forecast over the policy horizon to be aligned 
with the 3 percent target. As we have said time and again, that is the main contribution that 
monetary  policy  can  make  to  the  country’s  development  and  welfare.  Without  a  good 
macroeconomic  framework,  development  in  other  areas  becomes  elusive.  Of  course,  in 
macroeconomic stability, the Central Bank plays an essential role. 
Thank you very much.
