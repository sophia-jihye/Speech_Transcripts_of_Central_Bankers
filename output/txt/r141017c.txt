Andrew G Haldane: Twin peaks 
Speech  by  Mr  Andrew  G  Haldane,  Executive  Director  of  the  Bank  of  England,  at  the 
Kenilworth Chamber of Trade Business breakfast, Kenilworth, 17 October 2014. 
 The views are not necessarily those of the Bank of England or the Monetary Policy Committee. I would like to 
thank  Maria  Barriel, Jeremy  Franklin,  Clare  Macallan  and  Brad  Speigner  for  assistance  in  preparing  the  text.  I 
would also like to thank John Barrdear, Lucy Canham, Rob Elder, David Latto, Richard Harrison, Jeremy Harrison 
and Martin Weale for their comments and contributions.  
Back in June, with the cricket season in full swing, my views on the appropriate stance for 
UK monetary policy were evenly-weighted between the front foot (moving rates sooner) and 
the back foot (moving them later). With the sun shining, meteorologically and economically, 
the evidence leaned slightly towards a front foot stance (Haldane (2014)). 
Underpinning that judgement was the UK’s increasingly well-established and broadly-based 
economic recovery. Moving in a timely fashion to normalise rates helped avoid the risk of a 
hastier reaction later. In other words, it supported a limited and gradual subsequent path for 
interest rate rises.   
Three  months  on,  with  temperatures  falling  and  the  football  season  in  full  swing,  how  do 
economic prospects now look? Has the financial weather changed? How have the economic 
batting averages evolved? And how has the appropriate monetary stance, back or front foot, 
been affected? 
Reasons to the cheerful  
In many respects, the UK’s recovery remains both strong and well-balanced. There are still 
plenty of reasons to be cheerful: 
• 
Growth is running at an annual rate of over 3%, above its historical trend and at the 
top of the G7 league table. Growth in the UK will probably exceed global growth this 
year, for the first time in over a decade. According to outside and MPC forecasts, 
UK growth is expected to remain at or above trend for the next few years. 
Recent  revisions  to  GDP  suggest  that  the  UK  experienced  both  a  shallower 
recession, and a somewhat stronger recovery, than previously believed. As a result, 
the level of GDP reached its pre-crisis peak in the middle of last year, three quarters 
sooner than earlier estimates suggested. 
UK  growth  is  reasonably  well-balanced  between  consumption  and  investment, 
although  net  trade  continues  to  disappoint.  Business  investment  is  growing  at 
double-digit rates and has contributed fully a third to economy-wide growth since its 
trough.  According  to  the  MPC’s  forecasts,  investment  will  continue  to  grow  at 
double-digit rates in the period ahead. 
Consumer  price  inflation,  at  1.2%,  has  fallen  below  the  Bank  of  England’s  2% 
inflation  target,  reducing  the  squeeze  on  households’  real  disposable  incomes. 
According to financial markets, inflation is expected to return and stay close to target 
over the medium term. 
Borrowing  costs  remain  at  exceptionally  low  levels.  Secured  borrowing  costs  for 
households  and  large  companies  are  in  the  range  3%–6%,  around  3  percentage 
points  lower  than  in  2007.  Measures  of  credit  conditions  have  continued  to  ease. 
According to the August Inflation Report forecasts, they will continue to ease in the 
period ahead.

  Asset  prices  have  risen  significantly,  boosting  economy-wide  wealth.  Since  2009, 
UK equity prices have risen by over 50%, UK ten-year government bond prices by 
around 15% and UK house prices by around 20%.1  
Perhaps most striking of all, employment in the UK has risen by almost 1.8 million 
since its trough and by around 750,000 in the past year alone. The unemployment 
rate has fallen from a peak of 8.4% to 6%. According to the August Inflation Report 
forecasts, it is expected to fall further in the period ahead, to close to 5%.  
Economists since Arthur Okun have often combined macro-economic measures into a single 
index.2  It  speaks  volumes  for  economists’  psychological  state  that  they  tend  to  call  these 
“misery indices”. Although something of a dog’s breakfast, misery indices provide a simple 
summary statistic of macro-economic health.  
I  have  constructed  an  index  of  unemployment,  inflation  and  GDP  growth  in  the  UK.  The 
higher GDP growth, and the lower unemployment and inflation, the higher is the index and 
the  healthier  is  assumed  to  be  the  economy.  The  choice  of  these  measures,  and  their 
weighting, is rather arbitrary.3 To buck Thomas Carlyle’s image of the economist as dismal 
scientist, let’s call this an “ecstasy index”.  
Chart  1  plots  the  ecstasy  index  for  the  UK  since  1970.  The  index  is  currently  about 
6 percentage  points  above  its  average  value  over  the  period  1970–2014.4  As  recently  as 
2009, it was around 2 percentage points below. The index has been above current levels in 
only 5 of the past 44 years. On this measure, the UK economy is in fine fettle.  
The current reading of the index chimes pretty well with survey measures of confidence, for 
both households and firms. Measures of business confidence picked up during 2013 and the 
first half of 2014 to reach series highs, while measures of consumer confidence rose above 
their long-run average levels at the start of 2014.  
Chart  2  constructs  the  same  ecstasy  index  back  to  1870.  It  suggests  that,  while  current 
levels of the index are less unusual, they are edging up towards historic highs. In only 42 of 
the past 144 years has the index been above current levels.   
So far, then, so good. The UK economy appears to be healthier than on average in the past, 
if perhaps not quite yet ecstatic. Certainly, it appears to be firmly on the front foot. 
Reasons to be fearful  
In  keeping  with  Thomas  Carlyle’s  stereotype,  let  me  now  add  three  flies  to  the  ointment. 
These are features of the UK economy which paint a more sobering picture. In particular, let 
me offer three reasons to be fearful:  
• 
Annual real wage growth in the UK – average weekly earnings growth adjusted for 
consumer price inflation – is currently running at close to minus 1%. Growth in real 
wages has been negative for all bar three of the past 74 months. The cumulative fall 
in real wages since their pre-recession peak is around 10%. As best we can tell, the 
length and depth of this fall is unprecedented since at least the mid-1800s (Table 1).  
Productivity – GDP per hour worked – was broadly unchanged in the year to 2014 
Q2, leaving it around 15% below its pre-crisis trend level. The level of productivity is 
no  higher  than  it  was  six  years  ago.  This  is  the  so-called  “productivity  puzzle”. 
                                                 
1  House prices are measured using the average of the Halifax and Nationwide indices. 
2  Okun’s original misery index, which was also referred to as the “discomfort factor”, comprised unemployment and inflation.   
3  Adding real wealth and/or real borrowing costs to the index does not alter the underlying trends. 
4  The value for 2014 is an estimate based on projections consistent with the August 2014 Inflation Report.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 Productivity has not flat-lined for that long in any period since the 1880s, other than 
following demobilisation after the World Wars.  
Annual  real  interest  rates  –  for  example,  rates  earned  by  households  on  time 
deposits adjusted for consumer price inflation – are around zero. They have been 
near-zero for close to four years. Real deposit rates have not been that low since 
the 1970s, when inflation was in double digits.   
These  indicators  clearly  have  an  important  bearing  on  macro-economic  health:  among 
workers  whose  disposable  incomes  have  fallen  materially  below  their  pre-crisis  levels; 
among  savers,  the rates  of return  on  whose  assets  have  fallen  materially  below  their  pre-
crisis  levels  and  are  near-zero  in  inflation-adjusted  terms;  and  among  companies,  whose 
underlying efficiency has flat-lined since the crisis.   
These  trends  are  also  closely  linked.  Weak  productivity  has  constrained  UK  companies’ 
ability  to  pay  higher  wages,  such  that  productivity  and  real  wages  have  fallen  in  lockstep 
since 2008 (Chart 3). And this combination of a weak supply side and weak pricing pressures 
has in turn generated the need for low or negative real interest rates.  
To  give  these  developments  some  context,  consider  a  simple  index  of  real  wages,  real 
interest rates and productivity growth. Given their recent trends, and with an eye to semantic 
symmetry, let’s call this an “agony index”. Charts 4 and 5 plot this agony index from 1970 
and back to 1870.  
The agony index is currently at painfully low levels.5 It has been around 5 percentage points 
below  its  1970–2014  average  since  2008.  Such  an  extended  period  of  agony  is  virtually 
unprecedented going back to the late 1800s, with the exception of the aftermath of the World 
Wars and the early 1970s.  
So far, then, so bad. On this evidence, the UK economy is as weak as at any time in the 
recent  or  distant  past.  It  is  firmly  on  the  back  foot.  Rather  peculiarly,  the  UK  economy 
appears to be writhing in both agony and ecstasy. It is twin-peaked.  
Short-lived or secular?  
So which of these twin forces is likely to win out? This is an issue on which a global debate is 
currently raging. For some, the world is experiencing a fairly conventional recovery – perhaps 
slower  and  lower  than  usual,  but  with  normal  service  resuming.  For  others,  the  world  is 
instead facing a more protracted period of sub-par growth – an era of “secular stagnation” 
(Summers (2014)).   
The MPC’s central view, as contained in its August Inflation Report, is a mix of the two views, 
but with a stronger flavour of the first. It envisages a slower and lower recovery than in the 
past, but which builds in momentum over time. For example, according to the Inflation Report 
projections, productivity and real wage growth are expected to enter positive territory during 
the first half of next year and real interest rates by 2016 (Chart 6).   
Thereafter, all three are forecast to continue rising. By the end of 2017, productivity growth 
and real wage growth are back to around 2% and real household deposit rates are in positive 
territory (Chart 6). The agony index would then be back in line with its historical average. In 
other words, on the MPC’s central view the sun will come out tomorrow.  
The experience of past recessions supports this weather forecast. Chart 7 plots the path of 
real GDP following five UK recessions and subsequent recoveries: the 1930s, the 1970s, the 
1980s, the 1990s and currently. The fall in GDP during this time’s crisis is little different than 
in the 1970s and 1980s and smaller than in the Great Depression.   
                                                
5  Again, the value for 2014 is an estimate based on projections consistent with the August 2014 Inflation Report.

The subsequent recovery in output has been materially slower than in the 1970s, 1980s and 
1990s – and slower even than in the 1930s. As a result, the cumulative loss of output from 
this time’s crisis will very likely be larger than followed the Great Depression.  
Nonetheless, once you allow for the longer lags, the growth in GDP over the past two years 
has not been greatly dissimilar to previous recoveries. And if you believe the MPC’s growth 
forecasts, that recovery is set to continue in the period ahead.  
At a global level, the IMF’s recent World Economic Outlook paints a not dissimilar picture. 
Although global growth was revised down, it is expected to pick up from 3.3% this year to 
3.8% next and 4.0% the year after. In other words, the IMF also foresees a slow march back 
to growth normality, albeit at potentially somewhat lower trend rates.  
So why might this time be different? One illuminating piece of evidence comes from looking 
at how forecasts for real wages, productivity and real interest rates have evolved during the 
recovery. As one illustration, Charts 8 to 10 show Inflation Report forecast profiles for these 
three variables since 2008.  
These suggest that the MPC, in common with every other mainstream forecaster, has been 
forecasting  sunshine  tomorrow  in  every  year  since  2008  –  that  is,  rising  real  wages, 
productivity and real interest rates. The heat-wave has failed to materialise. The timing of the 
upturn has been repeatedly put back. Downside surprises have been correlated.  
What is true in the UK is also true globally. In their most recent World Economic Outlook, the 
IMF  evaluated  their  forecast  performance  since  the  crisis.  This  too  points  towards 
systematic, serially correlated, downside surprises to global growth since 2008.   
Of course, this is evidence from the past not the future. Are there reasons to believe these 
surprises might persist into the future? Financial market prices can provide some guide, in 
particular about the likely future path of real interest rates.  
Chart 11 plots how global real interest rates have evolved since 1970. It exhibits a secular 
downward  trend  which  long  precedes  the  crisis,  suggesting  global  desired  savings  rates 
outstripped global desired investment rates. Pre-crisis explanations for this trend included a 
“glut” of savings in the East and “excess” consumption in the West (King (2011)).   
Whatever  the  cause,  the  crisis  resulted  in  a  further  lurch  down  in  global  real  rates,  with 
precautionary savings rising and investment intentions falling. More strikingly still, there has 
been the further marked fall in global real rates during the course of this year. Five-year real 
interest rates expected in five years’ time have fallen by over 100 basis points in the United 
Kingdom, the euro area and the United States (Chart 12).  
The upshot is a fascinating pattern of real interest rates along the yield curve (Chart 13). In 
the UK, real interest rates are now expected to remain negative for at least the next 40 years. 
The  pattern  is  less  dramatic  in  the  US  and  euro-area,  but  even  there  real  rates remain at 
exceptionally low levels as far as the eye can see.6 
That is truly extra-ordinary and naturally begs the question – why? One hypothesis is that it 
simply  reflects  a  portfolio  shift  by  investors  towards  government  assets  –  if  you  like,  a 
“search  for  safety”  in  the  face  of  heightened  geo-political  risks.  The  implications  for  future 
growth might then be relatively benign, either because these risks are short-lived or because 
they  do  not  affect  companies’  investment  plans.  In  other  words,  the  pattern  of  real  rates 
might still be consistent with a recovery.  
                                                
6  The levels of these international series are not entirely comparable, as UK real rates are indexed to RPI, whereas US and 
European are indexed to CPI.

 An alternative hypothesis is that these developments reflect pessimistic expectations about 
future growth prospects, which are mirrored in expected policy rates needing to remain lower 
for  much  longer.  This  would  carry  more  far-reaching  and  negative  implications  for  the 
economy, more in line with the secular stagnation hypothesis.   
A tale of two workers  
So which of the twin-peaked outcomes facing the economy is most likely? An imminent burst 
of macro-economic sunshine? Or leaden-grey skies as far as the eye can see?   
Several  factors  have  been  put  forward  to  support  the  secular  stagnation  hypothesis.  They 
include rising levels of inequality, worsening levels of educational attainment, a rising debt 
overhang, lower prices for investment goods, rising levels of youth unemployment and lower 
levels of innovation (Gordon (2012), VoxEU (2014)). None should be dismissed lightly.  
But  nor  do  these factors  necessarily  contradict the  possibility  of  recovery  in  at  least  some 
parts  of  the  economy.  It  is  entirely  possible  that  both  poles  may  be  in  play  –  if  you  like, 
sunshine with showers – pulling the economy in opposing directions. Those polarising forces 
are well illustrated by developments in the labour market.   
Polarisation in the labour market has been a phenomenon since at least the 1980s, with a 
“hollowing out” of employment across the skill-distribution (Goos and Manning (2007) Goos 
et al (2009), Autor et al (2003, 2006, 2010), Sissons (2011), McIntosh (2013), Plunkett and 
Pessoa  (2013)).  Employment  growth  has  been  strongest  among  the  highest  and  lowest-
skilled. But the casualty has been the mid-skilled, where employment has fallen.  
This structural shift is usually attributed to technological displacement of mid-skill jobs – for 
example,  because  of  the  automation  and  digitisation  of  certain  tasks.  For  that  reason,  a 
“smiley face” employment pattern has been found across a wide number of countries when 
looked at in skills space. This is shown for the UK in Chart 14.   
The crisis has tended to reinforce these trends. Unemployment among the highly-skilled rose 
less during the crisis (Chart 15). With employment growth strong (Chart 14), unemployment 
within the highly-skilled sectors has returned to close to pre-crisis levels.   
By  contrast,  unemployment  rates  among  the  mid-skilled  rose  by  more  during  the  crisis 
(Chart 15).  In  keeping  with  pre-crisis  trends,  employment  has  contracted  (Chart  14). 
Meanwhile, for the lowest skilled the picture is more nuanced. While suffering most during 
the  crisis,  they  have  also  benefitted  from  rapid  rises  in  employment  during  the  recovery 
(Chart 14).  
In principle, these patterns of employment ought to have been reflected in real wages. We 
might expect wages to have risen at either end of the skill distribution, but potentially to have 
stalled  for  the  mid-skilled.  There  would  have  been  a  “hollowing  out”  of  wages,  but  the 
aggregate wage distribution ought to have been relatively static.   
In  practice,  the  distribution  of  wages  has  not  been  static;  it  has  widened  over  the  past 
20 years  (Chart  16).  In  the  late  1990s,  wages  for  the  top  10%  of  earners  were  around 
6.5 times higher than the bottom 10%. Today, the figure is closer to eight. Or, put differently, 
in the decade prior to the recession, real wages for the top decile rose on average by 3% per 
year, while for the bottom decile they rose by around half that.  
Since  the  crisis,  there  has  been  an  across-the-board  squeeze  on  real  wages  (Gregg  et  al 
(2014)).  Those  distributional  differences  have,  however,  persisted  and  have  if  anything 
widened further. Despite having fallen by almost 10% since the crisis, real wages among the 
top 10% are still over 20% higher than in 1997. But wages for the bottom 20% have fallen by 
almost 20% since 2007 and are essentially back to where they were in 1997.  
These polarising forces in the labour market are also evident across industries (Chart 17).  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 5 
Between  2001  and  2007,  median  annual  wage  growth  across  industries  was  4%  with  a 
standard  deviation  of  1  percentage  point.  During  2014,  average  real  wage  growth  has 
averaged 1% with a standard deviation of 2.5 percentage points (Chart 18). Wage dispersion 
has risen markedly. In some sectors wages are growing faster than before the crisis, while in 
others they are falling in both real and nominal terms.  
So while strong employment demand has helped sustain wages among the highly-skilled, it 
has  not  worked  the  same  magic for  the  lower  skilled. That  begs  the question  –  why?  The 
most  likely  explanation  is  that  rising  demand  has  been  more  than  offset  by  the  rise  in  the 
supply of labour for these services. Several factors are likely to have been at play.  
First, displaced mid-skilled workers may have sought jobs for which they are over-qualified in 
order  to  stay  in  employment.  In  other  words,  they  have  moved  down  the  skill  distribution, 
placing downward pressure on wages. The crisis is likely to have reinforced these trends.  
Second, participation rates within the labour force have increased significantly, both prior to 
the crisis and over the past couple of years, especially among women and older age cohorts. 
This reflects a range of factors including the abolition of the default retirement age, concerns 
about the adequacy of pension and saving income and changes to the benefits regime.   
Third,  levels  of  immigration  have  increased  significantly  over  the  past  20  years,  boosting 
labour supply. There is an active debate on its effects on the wage distribution. For example, 
Dustmann et al (2013) find that each 1% increase in the share of migrants in the working age 
population  leads  to  a  0.6%  decline  in  the  wages  of  the  5%  lowest-paid  workers.  Several 
studies report similar results (Migration Advisory Committee (2012)).  
At  a  headline  level,  these  polarising  patterns  are  also  clear  in  aggregate  wage  data. 
According  to  contacts  of  the  Bank’s  Agents,  staff  shortages  are  rising  in  highly-skilled 
professions  such  as  IT,  engineering  and  construction.  Furthermore,  the  Recruitment  & 
Employment Confederation (REC) survey suggests that the annual rate of wage inflation for 
new hires is now above 4% (Chart 19).   
But measures of economy-wide average weekly earnings (AWE) paint an altogether different 
picture. Annual rates of wage inflation are currently around 0.7%, below the rate of inflation. 
Put  differently,  the  jaws  between  the  wage  growth  of  the  highly-skilled  and  the  rest  of  the 
economy  are  wide  and  have  widened.  If  the  self-employed  were  added  to  the  mix,  whose 
wage levels are on average lower, those jaws would be wider still (Gardiner (2014)).  
Taken together, this paints a picture of a widening distribution of fortunes across the labour 
market – a tale of two workers. The upper peak of the labour market is clearly thriving in both 
employment and wage terms. The mid-tier is languishing in both employment and real wage 
terms.  And for the  lower  skilled,  employment  is up  at the  cost  of  lower  real  wages for  the 
group as a whole. This has been a jobs-rich, but pay-poor, recovery.  
What is true among workers is also evident among companies (Barnett et al (2014a, 2014b)). 
There is evidence of a widening distribution of performance across companies and sectors. 
Since  the  crisis,  the  distribution  of  productivity  across  sectors  has  widened  more  than 
fourfold (Chart 20). And while productivity among the best-performing firms has held up, for 
others it has fallen like a stone (Chart 21). 
If  this  story  of  a  growing,  but  diverging,  economy  is  right,  then  the  message  is  clear. 
Forecasts of both macro-economic sunshine and showers, tales of both agony and ecstasy, 
sightings of both the upper and lower peaks, may be here for some time to come.   
Monetary policy implications  
A bi-modal distribution for the economy poses a particular challenge for monetary policy. It 
can  only  affect  average  outcomes  in  the  economy.  Should  policy  tighten  in  anticipation  of 
tomorrow’s sunshine for some? Or remain loose fearing tomorrow’s rain for others?   
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
To  illustrate  those  dilemmas,  consider  some  very  simple  and  mechanical  settings  for 
monetary policy as given by a Taylor rule (Taylor (1993)). The simplest of the Taylor rules 
takes the form:  
𝑖𝑡−𝜋𝑡=𝑟𝑡∗+𝜃𝜋(𝜋𝑡−𝜋∗)+𝜃𝑦�𝑦𝑡−𝑦�𝑡� 
In other words, the real policy rate (it – πt) deviates from its equilibrium rate (r*t) to the extent 
that inflation (πt) deviates from its target (π*) and output (yt) from its trend (ŷt). In Taylor’s 
original work, the feedback parameters, 𝜃𝜋 and 𝜃𝑦, were both set at 0.5 and r* at 2%, in line 
with its historic average.  
If we plug measures of inflation and the output gap into equation (1), both historically and 
using the MPC’s forecasts for the future, we generate the Taylor-rule implied paths shown in 
Chart  22.  Also  shown  is  the  path  of  actual  and  (looking  forward)  market-implied  policy 
interest rates at the time of the August 2014 Inflation Report.  
Both in the years running up to the crisis, and in the initial crisis stages, these paths roughly 
coincided. Policy was broadly on its Taylor rule-implied path. Since around 2010, however, 
the two paths have parted company. On the Taylor rule path, monetary policy  would have 
begun tightening at the end of 2009 and interest rates would be fully 2½ percentage points 
higher today.   
Taken at face value, this implied trajectory poses a challenge to current policy settings. If this 
was a business-as-usual recovery,  with equilibrium real rates close to historical levels, the 
Taylor-rule would suggest a considerably more aggressive monetary policy response, and a 
tighter stance, than has been the case in practice.7   
Of  course,  there  are  good  reasons  for  believing  this  may  not  be  a  business-as-usual 
recovery. For one thing, medium-term real rates of interest are materially lower than in the 
past (Chart 12). If these expectations were to be mirrored in persistently lower growth rates 
in the economy, then that would imply a lower equilibrium real rate of interest.8  
Assume that equilibrium real interest rates are not fixed at 2%, but move in line with the real 
forward rate curve shown in Chart 13. That would give the Taylor rule path shown in Chart 
23.  This  is  now  consistently  below  the  actual  and  market-implied  path.  In  other  words,  if 
secular  stagnation  is  the  name  of  the  game,  the  Taylor  rule  suggests  interest  rates  could 
remain lower for longer than markets currently expect.  
So  how  should  a  policy-maker  choose  between  these twin  peaks  and  their  implied  paths? 
The optimal response could be to probability-weight the two peaks, updating the probabilities 
as  new  data  arrives.  Financial  markets  may  be  doing  just  that.  Implied  interest  rates  lie 
between the upper peak recovery of Chart 22 and the lower peak of Chart 23. Markets rates 
have coursed a path in the valley between the twin peaks.  
But this path is also shifting towards the lower peak. Over the past few months, the implied 
path for interest rates in the UK and globally has shifted down. In the UK, forward interest 
rates at the end of 2017 have shifted down by 80bp since the middle of the year, to stand 
below  1.7%.  One  interpretation  of  that  move  is  the  market  is  now  assigning  a  somewhat 
higher probability to the lower peak.  
                                                
7  An important reason why the Taylor rule points to tighter policy over this period is that the United Kingdom was hit by a 
series of large relative price shocks – increases in import prices (stemming from both the depreciation of sterling and rises in 
commodity and world export prices), increases in energy price, and changes to the rate of VAT – that raised CPI inflation. It 
is not obvious that tightening monetary policy in line with the prescription from the Taylor rule in order to offset these shocks 
would have been desirable.  
8  By contrast, if the effect on supply capacity was only temporary, lowering the measured output gap, that could imply the 
need for tighter policy.

Whether  this  is  the  optimal  –  or  indeed  even  the  most  likely  –  path  for  interest  rates  is  a 
different issue. For example, if there is genuine uncertainty about the path of the economy, 
the  optimal  policy  response  may  be  to  avoid  the  worst  outcomes  –  in  other  words,  to  set 
policy to avoid the lower peak. That might imply a path for rates closer to Chart 23.  
Conclusion  
In June, when evaluating the UK’s monetary stance, I used the metaphor of a batsmen in 
cricket deciding whether to play off the front foot (raise rates) or the back foot (hold rates). 
And I compared the averages of two English batsmen, one who played from the front foot 
(Ian Bell), the other from the back (Joe Root), to illustrate the dilemma.   
At the time, Ian Bell averaged 45 to Joe Root’s 43. In other words, while it was a close run 
thing, the data narrowly favoured the front foot. Cricketing statistics are not the sole basis for 
my views on the appropriate stance for UK monetary policy. Nonetheless, on balance, I felt 
the same front-foot judgement was appropriate for UK interest rates at the time.  
Three months  on,  it  is time to  update  the  batting  averages. Ian  Bell’s  batting  average  has 
remained at 45 – the front foot recovery has remained on track. But over the same period, 
Joe Root’s has risen to 51. Cricket statisticians and financial markets are agreed. While still a 
close run thing, the statistics now appear to favour the back foot.  
On balance, my judgement on the macro-economy has shifted the same way. I have tended 
to view the economy through a bi-modal lens. And recent evidence, in the UK and globally, 
has shifted my probability distribution towards the lower tail. Put in rather plainer English, I 
am gloomier.  
That reflects the mark-down in global growth, heightened geo-political and financial risks and 
the  weak  pipeline  of  inflationary  pressures  from  wages  internally  and  commodity  prices 
externally. Taken together, this implies interest rates could remain lower for longer, certainly 
than I had expected three months ago, without endangering the inflation target. 
Thank you.
