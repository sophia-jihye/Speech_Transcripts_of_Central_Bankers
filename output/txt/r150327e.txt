 Andrew G Haldane: Drag and drop 
 Speech by Mr Andrew G Haldane, Executive Director and Chief Economist of the Bank of 
England, at BizClub lunch, Rutland, 19 March 2015. 
 The views are not necessarily those of the Bank of England or the Monetary Policy Committee. I would like to 
thank Gareth Anderson, Jeremy Franklin, Richard Harrison, Riccardo Masolo, Becky Maule, Roland Meeks and 
especially  Tom  Smith  for  their  assistance  in  preparing  the  text.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  Rebecca  Burnham, 
Rupert de Vincent-Humphreys, Will Dison, Fernando Eguren Martin, David Elliott, Nicholas Fawcett, Bob Gilhooly, 
Jeremy  Harrison,  Simon  Hayes,  Chris  Jackson,  Phil  King,  Jenny  Lam,  David  Miles,  Francesca  Monti,  Liam 
Parker,  Kate  Reinold,  Gareth  Ramsey,  Matt  Roberts-Sklar,  Magda  Rutkowska,  Ali  Schomberg,  Kate  Stratford, 
Rahul Thakrar, Ryland Thomas, Dan Wales and Madeleine Warwick for their comments and contributions. 
In March 2009 the Bank of England cut official UK interest rates to 0.5%, their lowest-ever 
level. Financial markets did not expect this low level of interest rates to persist, with the first 
rise expected nine months later in December 2009. Yet six years on, official UK interest rates 
remain  at  0.5%.  The  first  rise  in  UK  interest  rates  is  still  expected  around  a  year  hence 
(Chart 1). Like a bad flight, the take-off time for interest rates has been repeatedly put back. 
That  pattern  has  been  mirrored  internationally.  In  March  2009  US  policy  rates  were  in  a 
range of 0–0.25%, their lowest-ever level. Markets expected them to rise within a year. In the 
euro-area, policy rates were also at all-time lows, but were expected to rise within 18 months 
or  so.  Six  years  on,  US  policy  rates  remain  between  0–0.25%,  while  euro-area  rates  are 
150 basis points lower. The first rise in US policy rates is still expected within a year, while 
the first rise in euro-area rates is now not expected for over four years (Chart 2).

Looking beyond lift-off, the expected pace of interest rate ascent is also remarkably gradual 
by historical comparison. Chart 3 shows the paths of short-term forward interest rates in the 
UK,  US,  euro-area  and  Japan  for  the  next  30  years.  They  imply  that  rates  will  rise,  on

average,  by  only  10  basis  points  per  year  in  the  US,  7  basis  points  per  year  in  the  UK, 
6 basis points per year  in Japan and 5 basis points per year in the euro-area. That is the 
most gradual of interest rate glide-paths. 
The  eventual  cruising  altitude  for  interest  rates  expected  by  financial  markets  is  also 
remarkably low by historical comparison. The level of forward interest rates 30 years hence 
is around 3% in the US, 2.5% in the UK, 2% in Japan and 1.2% in the euro-area. Up until the 
crisis, the average level of policy rates in these countries in the post-war period was 3%, 7%, 
4%  and  3%  respectively  –  for  most,  roughly  double  the  levels  currently  expected.  Interest 
rate end-points are also remarkably low. 
In  a  growing  number  of  countries,  interest  rates  are  not  just  low  but  have  recently  turned 
negative.  At  last  count,  eleven  countries  had  negative  shorter-term  bond  yields,  including 
nine within the euro-area. In part, that reflects the effects of a recent further round of policy 
loosening  by  central  banks.  At  present,  two-thirds  of  countries  globally  have  policy  rates 
below 3% (Chart 4).

Of  course,  what  goes  down  can  also  bounce  back  up.  Recently,  there  has  been  some 
upwards movement in UK and US yield curves. But yields elsewhere, especially in Europe, 
have  continued  to  fall.  And  the  longer-term  trend  is  clear:  a  persistent  ratcheting-down  in 
interest rates across all maturities and virtually all countries, to reach unprecedentedly low 
levels. As a recent example of that, Chart 5 plots the UK forward curve at monthly intervals 
over the past 9 months.

The drop 
A  significant  part  of  the  explanation  for 
low  interest  rates,  at  least  in  the  years 
immediately  after  the  crisis,  was  the 
weakness  of  demand.  Chart  6  looks  at 
the  path  for  UK  output  growth  expected 
in 
Inflation  Report  each 
February  since  2009.  Up  until  around 
2012, growth significantly and repeatedly disappointed to the downside. 
The  same  was  true  internationally,  with  IMF  forecasts  significantly  and  repeatedly  revised 
down. With recovery weaker and taking longer than expected, the expected date of interest 
rate rises was repeatedly put back, and the expected level of future rates was lowered, in the 
UK (Chart 1) and globally (Chart 2). 
Over the past two years, this story has subtly changed. UK growth has, if anything, surprised 
to  the  upside  over  this  period.  UK  growth  in  2013  and  2014  averaged  over  2%.  And  the 
MPC’s February Inflation Report forecasts the UK growing above its historic trend over the 
next two years. 
Yet despite this, the expected path of UK interest rates has continued to drift down. That is 
because macro-economic surprises have continued, but have switched from the real to the 
nominal  side,  from  stalling  growth  to  falling  inflation.  Inflation  has  consistently  and 
significantly undershot the Bank’s forecasts since 2012, in particular over the past 12 months 
(Chart 7).

This pattern has been mirrored internationally. Global consumer price index (CPI) inflation, 
on a PPP-weighted basis, currently stands at 1.2%, having fallen 1.8 percentage points over 
the past two years (Chart 8). Around 40 countries internationally are currently experiencing 
deflation (Chart 9). At a global level, inflation was undershooting national inflation targets by 
almost 2 percentage points in January 2015.1

UK CPI inflation has closely followed global CPI trends since the crisis, with their correlation 
strikingly  high  at  0.8  –  double  its  level  pre-crisis.  UK  inflation  currently  stands  at  0.3%,  its 
lowest-ever  recorded level. According to the MPC’s latest  Inflation Report, it is more likely 
than not the UK will join those countries facing temporary deflation this year. 
These global disinflationary forces are, in large part, the result of shocks to world prices. Oil 
prices have fallen by over 50% since the middle of last year. By itself, this would be expected 
to lower temporarily UK CPI inflation by around ¾ percentage points. Beyond oil, agricultural 
commodity  prices  have  fallen  by  25%  in  the  past  two  years  due  to  good  harvests.  Global 
non-fuel export prices, on a UK trade-weighted basis, have fallen 2%. 
These weak external price pressures go a long way towards explaining the fall in global CPI 
inflation over the past two years. They also account for around two-thirds of the fall in UK CPI 
inflation over the same period. If these are one-off shocks to the price level, their impact on 
annual inflation measures should drop out after a year. Such temporary deviations of inflation 
from target should be “looked through” in setting monetary policy.2 
This is not, however, the whole inflation story. The weakness of global prices is not wholly 
the result of one-off shifts in global supply. For example, although supply news is likely to 
have  been  the  biggest driver  of  the  recent  fall  in  oil  prices,  a  weakening  outlook  for  world 
demand is also likely to have played a material role. 
Moreover, perhaps between a quarter and a third of the fall in inflation, globally and in the 
UK, is not explained by weak external prices. Another source of “drag” has been at work.3 
Identifying those drag factors is important when accounting for disinflationary trends in the 
past, but also when assessing whether these trends will persistent in the future. 
The drag 
If  you  consider  the  traditional  determinants  of  inflation,  there  are  at  least  three  plausible 
sources of disinflationary “drag”: slack in the economy, a weaker relationship between slack 
and wages and lower levels of inflation expectations. 
These  explanations  are  not  mutually  exclusive.  Higher  levels  of  slack,  or  a  weaker 
relationship  between  slack  and  wages,  could  lower  inflation  expectations  –  for  example,  if 
demand  is  weak  today,  people  may  expect  lower  inflation  tomorrow.  And  lower  wage  and 
inflation expectations could themselves depress demand – for example, by raising levels of 
real interest rates. Nonetheless, it is worth considering these explanations in turn. 
Slack and the Phillips Curve 
(a) 
The short-term relationship between unemployment or the output gap and wage growth or 
inflation – the Phillips curve – is one of the most intensively studied in macro-economics.4 
Despite  that,  empirical  estimates  of  the  Phillips  curve  have  tended  to  be  poorly-identified. 
That may reflect the effects of structural and behavioural shifts, which have the potential to 
alter historically-estimated Phillips curve relationships. 
For example, changes in the credibility of the monetary policy regime can cause inflation and 
wage expectations to alter, causing the Phillips curve to shift around over time for a given 
level of slack. And changes in the competitive structure of labour and product markets can 
influence  the  impact  of  slack  on  wage  and  price  pressures,  causing  the  Phillips  curve  to 
change slope over time.

Chart 10 plots the historical relationship between wage growth and unemployment in the UK 
over the period since 1856. Although noisy, it suggests a negative relationship between the 
two, with an average slope of just under ½. In others words, a 1 percentage point increase in 
the unemployment rate has, on average in the past, lowered wage growth by around half a 
percentage point. 
A somewhat clearer window on this long-run Phillips curve relationship is provided by looking 
at  distinct  monetary  regimes:  exchange  rate  targeting  regimes  under  the  Gold  and  dollar 
standards  (1856–1970);  discretionary  monetary  policy  regimes  without  central  bank 
independence (1970–1997); and inflation-targeting regimes with independently-set monetary 
policies (1997 onwards). 
Chart  11  plots  the  Phillips  curve  relationship  over  these  windows.  The  introduction  of 
discretionary monetary policy regimes, without independence, caused an outward shift in the 
Phillips curve and a shift up in wage and inflation expectations. That is consistent with a loss 
of  monetary  credibility.  Since  1997,  however,  inflation  expectations  having  shifted  back 
inwards, restoring the Phillips curve to something closer to its position prior to 1970.5

If we look more closely at the most recent period, a second feature stands out (Chart 12). UK 
wage  growth  has  been  puzzlingly  weak  over  the  past  few  years,  lying  below  the  Phillips 
curve  estimated  since  1997.  While  UK  unemployment  has  fallen  more  than  2  percentage 
points since 2013, wage growth has remained in the range 1–2% per year. 
This is, to a degree, a global phenomenon. For example, the US Phillips curve also shifted 
inward after the Volcker disinflation of the early 1980s (Chart 13). And US wage growth has

Even after making these adjustments, however, the wage puzzle has persisted. This can be 
seen by comparing the actual and estimated paths of wages from the Bank’s suite of wage 
equations, using as inputs the Bank’s estimates of “slack” in the labour market, as well as 
productivity and other wage determinants.  
Wage  growth  has  consistently  and 
significantly  undershot  its  expected 
path,  even  after  controlling  for  slack 
and  other  shocks.  Cumulatively,  this 
undershoot  is  large,  with  the  level  of 
wages more than 2% below predicted 
estimates  over  the  past  two  years. 
There  are  a  number  of  possible 
explanations  for  this  wage  puzzle. 
These  have  potentially  quite  different 
implications  for  future  wage  growth 
and hence policy.  
The  first  is  simply  that  the  lags  from 
lower  unemployment  to  wage  growth 
are a little longer than in the past. That 
might  be  the  case  because  job-to-job 
flows in the labour market have been 
low  by  historical  standards,  only 
towards  pre-
recently  picking  up 
recession 
If  so,  we  might 
expect 
in 
wages to course-correct in the period 
ahead, as labour market activity picks up. 
In  essence,  this  is  the  judgement  underpinning  the  MPC’s  central  view  of  wages  in  the 
February Inflation Report. Wage growth is projected to rise, reaching 3.4% by end-2015. In 
effect, wages error-correct. There is some tentative evidence of wage growth picking up over 
the  past  few  months,  although  yesterday’s  wage  data  were  notably  weaker.  If  this  pick-up 
were to continue, the wage puzzle would have been benign. Indeed, with slack eroding, we 
might  then  be  concerned  that  wage  pressures  could  overshoot,  posing  upside  risks  to  the 
inflation target.7 
But there are other explanations of the wage puzzle which pose downside inflation risks. One 
is that the Phillips curve has become less steep than in the past. This would mean that a fall 
in unemployment might have a lower impact on wage pressures than in the past. This might 
arise because the pool of workers willing to enter the labour force at the existing wage rate 
has increased – for example, older workers prepared to work longer than they had planned 
or workers from overseas moving into the UK labour force.  
There is evidence of many of these trends intensifying over the past few years. For example, 
the unemployment rate among 18-to-24 year olds has fallen by almost 4 percentage points 
over  the  past  year.  The  trend  in  labour  force  participation  rate  has  picked  up  significantly 
among  women  and  older  cohorts  over  the  same  period.  And  net  migration  to  the  UK  was 
estimated to be almost 300,000 in the year to September 2014, almost double the level two 
years earlier.

There  is  evidence,  in  the  UK  and 
internationally,  to  support  the  Phillips 
curve  having  flattened  over  time.  For 
example,  cross-country  evidence  from 
the IMF suggests that the slope of the

around  one  in  the  1970s  to  0.1–0.2 
today (Chart 16). That could reflect the 
effects  of  globalisation,  enhancing 
competition  in  domestic  labour  and

curve  for  future  wage  growth  and 
inflation  can  be  assessed  by  re-
running the projections from the MPC’s 
February  Inflation  Report.  Specifically, 
assume a halving of the Phillips curve 
slope  used  in  the  model  of  Chart  15, 
from  1  to  0.5.9  That  slope  is  still  well 
above the levels in Chart 16. 
Chart  17  shows  the  results  from  this  exercise.  Wages  and  prices  are  both  weaker 
throughout: at the two-year horizon, wage growth is 0.6 percentage points lower than in the 
February  Inflation  Report,  while  inflation  is  0.2  percentage  points  lower.  In  other  words,  a 
flatter  Phillips  curve  would  generate  a  downside  risk  to  the  inflation  outlook  at  the  policy 
horizon. 
A final explanation for the wage puzzle is 
that  weak  wages  are  signalling  that  the 
output  or  unemployment  gap  is  larger 
than  currently  estimated.  There  are  a 
number  of  potential  sources  of  such 
additional  slack,  including  greater  spare 
capacity  in  firms,  a  greater  willingness 
among workers to increase their average 
hours,  or  a  lower  long-term  rate  of 
unemployment 
currently 
estimated by the Bank.10  
How much additional slack? Imagine you 
asked yourself how much slack would be 
needed to resolve the wage puzzle of the 
few  years.  Even  with  a  very 
past 
conservative  estimate  of 
the  Phillips 
curve slope, the implied degree of slack 
could  be  somewhere  close 
to  4%, 
materially  above 
the  MPC’s  current 
central view of slack of around ½%.

 the 
horizon, 
To  give  a  sense  of  its  implications, 
imagine the level of slack were currently 
around  2%  and  was  only  gradually 
eroded  over 
forecast.  Chart  18 
shows the resulting path of inflation and 
wage growth. Inflation and wage growth 
are  both  materially  weaker:  at  the  two-
year 
around 
0.2 percentage  points  lower  than  in  the 
MPC’s February Inflation Report.   
Each  of  these  three  explanations  of  the 
wage  puzzle  is  empirically  plausible.  If 
some  weight  is  given  to  the  final  two 
explanations,  the  risks  to  future  wage 
growth and inflation would be skewed to 
the downside, not only in the short-term 
but at longer horizons too.11

(b) 
A  complementary  explanation  for  the 
wage  puzzle,  which  goes  in  the  same 
direction,  is  that  inflation  expectations 
have  shifted  downwards.  To  the  extent  these  weaker  expectations  shape  firms’  wage-
bargaining and price-setting behaviour, this would impart downwards persistence into wage 
and inflation dynamics.  
There is an array of inflation expectations measures covering different sectors – households, 
companies, financial markets – and horizons – short and longer term. All of these measures 
have fallen over the course of the past two years, as actual inflation has fallen, though often 
by differing amounts. 
Among  households,  one-year-ahead  inflation  expectations,  as  reported  by  Citigroup,  have 
fallen by 120bp over the past year. At the five to ten year horizon, they have fallen by around 
30bp  (Chart  19).  Shorter-term  expectations  are  around  1.5  percentage  points,  and  longer-
term expectations around 1 percentage point, below their pre-crisis averages. Over the same 
period,  households’  inflation  expectations  from  the  Bank/NOP  survey  have  fallen  by  90bp, 
60bp and 50bp respectively at the one, two and five year horizons. 
Chart 20 looks at the term structure of expected inflation by households from the Bank/NOP 
survey,  relative  to  the  past  and  the  Bank’s  forecasts.12  The  term  structure  of  expected 
inflation is currently lower than at any stage since the crisis. Moreover, household inflation 
expectations  are  significantly  below  2%  at  the  two-year  horizon  and,  to  a  lesser  extent, 
thereafter. That means it is unclear, at present, whether household inflation expectations are 
consistent with the Bank hitting the inflation target. 
                                                 
11  The MPC’s February Inflation Report included a small downside skew to the inflation fan chart, but this did not 
extend to two years.  
12  These have been adjusted to take into account the average difference between perceptions of the level of 
current inflation and actual inflation.

Turning  to  financial  market  measures  of  inflation  expectations,  two-year  ahead  forward 
inflation rates have fallen by around 40bp over the past year and 5-year ahead expectations 
by the same amount. This appears to have been, to a degree, a global phenomenon, with 
forward inflation rates also falling in the US and euro-area (Chart 21).  
Chart 22 looks at the term structure of RPI inflation implied by inflation swap rates. Inflation is 
near the bottom of its distribution over the period 2009–2013. Financial markets appear to 
expect inflation to remain lower for longer than in the recent past. Because the period 2009–
2013  was  associated  with  higher  than  target  levels  of  inflation,  financial  market  inflation 
expectations may still be broadly consistent with the Bank’s inflation target.

Unconditional distribution from a parametric factor model using

January 2013 are excluded due to uncertainty about proposed

expectations of the RPI-CPI wedge. 
On either measure, inflation expectations have fallen over the past year at all horizons. At 
longer-term  horizons,  that  is  difficult  to  reconcile  with  global  disinflationary  trends  having 
been  the  result  of  one-off  falls  in  global  prices.  Measured  expectations  suggest  that  lower 
inflation  is  expected  to  persist.  To  the  extent  this  affected  wage  and  price-setting,  those 
expectations could become self-fulfilling. 
A  number  of  plausible  explanations  for  a  shift  in  longer-horizon  inflation  expectations  are 
possible. One is greater slack in the economy than is currently assumed in the MPC’s central 
projections. A second is doubt about the ability of monetary policymakers to boost inflation – 
for example, because of the constraint of the zero lower bound on interest rates. 
A third explanation is greater expected persistence in low global price pressures. One factor 
that  could  potentially  depress  global  prices  on  a  persistent  basis  is  a  shortfall  in  global 
demand  relative  to  supply.  As  Chart  23  shows,  the  IMF  estimates  the  global  output  gap 
currently to be around 2%. It is only forecast to close by 2019. This might be expected to 
exert global disinflationary pressure for the foreseeable future.13 
A final factor, with particular relevance to the UK over the past two years, is the exchange 
rate. Sterling’s effective exchange rate has appreciated by around 15% over that period and 
by around 3% since the start of the year. A mechanical model treatment of the appreciation 
this  year  would  imply  inflation  in  the  UK,  at  a  two  year  horizon,  would  be  around 
0.2 percentage points lower. What explains sterling’s appreciation and might it continue?  
Over the past few years, there has been a positive relationship between countries’ effective 
exchange  rates  and  news  about  demand  relative  to  overseas  competitors  (Chart  24). 
Positive  output  surprises  have  increased  the  attraction  of  a  currency  relative  to  its 
competitors, including by increasing the chances of a rise in relative interest rates.

This  is  a  plausible  explanation  for  the  recent  appreciation  of  sterling  and  the  dollar,  with 
positive demand and interest rate surprises in the UK and US relative to the euro-area and 
Japan.  Indeed,  those  latter  countries  have  in  addition  embarked  on  programmes  of  asset 
purchase which might have intensified downward pressures on euro and yen assets. 
This decoupling of the relative demand and monetary policy positions of the UK and US on 
the one hand, and the euro-area and Japan on the other, might have on-going implications 
for exchange rate movements. If these trends continued, they could result in some further 
appreciation  of  sterling  and  the  dollar  relative  to  the  euro  and  yen,  which  would  tend  to 
increase disinflationary pressures in the UK and US.

With  inflation  expectations  having  adjusted,  how  might  this  affect  wage  and  inflation 
behaviour?  Table  1  shows  estimates  of  two  estimated  Phillips  curves,  which  include  the 
typical  wage-determinants,  such  as  productivity,  but  also  include  (lagged)  measures  of 
inflation expectations for households (at a 2-year horizon) and financial markets (at a 5-year 
horizon). 
Both expectations measures are statistically significant in explaining wage growth. Every one 
percentage point fall in inflation expectations results in a similarly-sized fall in wage growth 
the  next  period.  With  household  expectations  having  fallen  90bp,  and  financial  market 
expectations  by  40bp  over  the  past  year,  this  implies  they  would  be  exerting  a  significant 
drag  on  wage  growth  at  present.  That  is  consistent  with  survey  evidence  from  the  Bank’s 
agents,  whose  contacts  cite  falling  inflation  expectations  as  the  most  important  factor 
currently holding back wage settlements.14

question is what, if any, monetary policy response might be appropriate as insurance against 
those downside risks. 
One insurance device comes from the specification of the inflation target itself. Even if the 
risks  to  inflation  are  asymmetric,  central  banks’  inflation  targets  typically  are  not.  This 
reduces the risk of monetary policy imparting a “deflationary bias”. The MPC’s own mandate 
is  crystal  clear:  deviations  above  and  below  the  2%  inflation  target  are  to  be  treated 
symmetrically. In its Open Letter to the Chancellor earlier this year, the MPC made clear it 
would act symmetrically to meet the inflation target.15 
A second insurance policy against downside inflation risk comes from clearly specifying the 
horizon over which inflation is expected to return to target following a deviation. Provided that 
horizon is credible, this reduces the risk of inflationary expectations becoming dislodged from 
the target on a persistent basis.  
In the UK, the inflation-targeting regime requires the MPC to specify the horizon over which it 
expects inflation to return to target if it deviates by more than one percentage point. In its 
Open Letter earlier this year, the MPC stated that it judged it appropriate to set policy so that 
inflation would likely return to target within two years. That was intended to provide a clear 
horizon for the MPC’s actions and as an anchor for inflation expectations.16 
A third potential source of policy insurance comes from making clear that, were it necessary 
on  inflationary  grounds  at  the  two-year  horizon,  monetary  policy  could be  eased  further.  If 
monetary policy were perceived to be constrained to the downside – for example, because of 
the  zero  lower  bound  on  interest  rates  –  that  could  affect  agents’  perceptions  of  the 
distribution of inflation risk, which would be skewed to the downside.  
At the time of its Open Letter, the MPC stated that it had a variety of tools available to ease 
policy, should that prove necessary. That included re-starting asset purchases (Quantitative 
Easing or QE) and cutting interest rates from their current level of 0.5% towards zero. The 
latter reflected a re-assessment by the MPC of the relative costs and benefits of a rate cut.  
Back in 2009, the MPC’s judgement was that the benefits of cutting rates below 0.5% were 
probably  outweighed  by  their  costs,  in  terms  of  the  negative  impact  on  financial  sector 
resilience and lending. With the financial sector now stronger, the MPC judges there may be 
greater scope to cut rates below 0.5%. 
This change in assessment could itself have had some impact in reducing the downside risks 
to inflation expectations. To see that, consider two inflation fan charts based on simulations 
from the Bank’s macro-economic model.17 Monetary policy is set according to a policy rule, 
which weights deviations of inflation from target and output from trend. These rules only differ 
in their assumed lower interest rate bound.18  
Chart  26  shows  the  inflation  fan  chart  assuming  an  effective  lower  interest  rate  bound  of 
0.5%, whereas Chart 27 shows it with an effective lower interest rate bound of zero. Both 
these  fan  charts  are  negatively  skewed.  But  by  reducing  the  lower  bound,  this  skew  is 
reduced  significantly.  For  example,  at  a  two-year  horizon  the  probability  of  deflation  is 
reduced from around 20% to around 10%. 
                                                 
15  Bank of England (2015b). 
16  Bank of England (2015b). 
17  Because these fan charts are based on stochastic simulations, they do not match precisely the fan charts in 
the Inflation Report, which are based on the MPC’s best collective judgement of the balance of risks. 
18  To keep things simple, the simulation does not consider the effects of QE, though in principle this could also 
be used to boost demand and inflation expectations.

Essentially, a lower effective bound gives the central bank more room for manoeuvre when 
responding  to  downside  inflation  news.  Indeed,  if  this  cushion  gets  internalised  in 
expectations,  it  reduces  the  probability  of  disinflationary  dynamics  taking  hold  in  the  first 
place.

A final, and the most conservative, insurance policy against disinflationary risks would be to 
ease monetary policy pre-emptively. Even if the modal view of expected inflation is for it to 
return to target over the planned horizon, mean expected inflation will be lower if risks are 
skewed to the downside. Provided policymakers care about these risks, there is then a case 
for setting policy in response to mean, rather than modal, inflation expectations.19  
This option is not a hypothetical one. Already during the course of less than three months 
this  year,  more  than  25  central  banks  internationally  have  eased  policy  through  a 
combination of lower interest rates, currency adjustments or unconventional methods.  
Here in the UK the situation is somewhat different, with activity growing pretty strongly and 
slack being eroded. The MPC’s best collective judgement is that interest rates are more likely 
than not to rise over the forecast horizon. Recent surveys of professional forecasters suggest 
they believe, unanimously, that the next rise in UK rates is likely to be upwards. 
                                                 
19  For example, a simple approximation to the assumption that policymakers care about the risks to the inflation 
outlook is the use of a “quadratic loss function” to characterise preferences over alternative outcomes. One 
implication  of  that  approximation  is  that  policymakers  should  care  about  the  mean  path  of  inflation  (see 
Svensson (2002)). Policymakers who take into account the risks associated with uncertainty over the structure 
of the economy (such as those discussed earlier in this speech) should care about the entire distribution of 
inflation (Svensson and Williams (2005)).

But 
have  a  more  nuanced  view.  They 
currently  assign  a  roughly  15%

interest  rates 
being cut over the next 12 months, 
versus  a  40%  probability  of  a  rise 
(Chart  28).  The  most 
likely 
outcome, in their view, is that rates 
will not change over the next year. 
I do not currently see an immediate 
case  for  a  policy  change  in  either 
direction. 
If  one  were  required, 
given  the  asymmetry  of  inflation 
risks,  I  think  the  chances  of  a  rate 
rise  or  cut  are  broadly  evenly 
balanced.  In  other  words,  my  view 
would  be  that  policy  may  need  to 
in 
move  off  either 
the 
immediate 
ahead, 
depending  on  which  way  risks 
break.  
As  a  thought  experiment,  imagine 
policy were not set by the MPC but 
instead  by  algorithm.    Specifically, 
this  algorithm 
to 
minimise deviations of inflation from 
target and output from trend, using 
the Bank’s forecasting model, COMPASS, to simulate the effect of alternative policy paths.20 
What  would  it  suggest  was  the  optimal  policy  path  given  these  preferences  and  the 
projections in the February Inflation Report? 
This  is  shown  in  Chart  29.  With  the  lower  bound  set  at  zero,  the  optimal  path  for  interest 
rates would involve them being cut in the short-run towards zero for around a year, before 
then roughly following the market yield curve. This results in inflation and output returning to 
target  sooner  than  in  the  February  Inflation  Report,  at  the  cost  of  a  slight  over-shoot 
thereafter. Even without any asymmetry in risks to the inflation outlook, a case can be made 
for policy easing today.

Were downside risks to inflation to materialise, this case is strengthened. Chart 30 shows the 
optimal policy paths if we assume the starting level of slack is larger in line with Chart 18. 
The interest rate path now implies that rates should be cut and held at their lower bound for 
longer. This alternative policy path returns output and inflation to target sooner, at the cost of 
a more significant over-shoot.

Of  course,  there  are  good  reasons  why  monetary  policy  is  not  set  by  algorithm.  These 
simulations ignore a number of important practical uncertainties. For example, they assume 
that  this  policy  path  is  fully  credible  and  effective  in  stimulating  demand  and  inflation 
expectations. In practice, the effects of a policy easing cannot be known with certainty and

policy credibility cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, there are upside as well as downside risks 
to  the  inflation  outlook.  Nonetheless,  these  experiments  are  in  my  view  the  right  baseline 
when assessing the appropriate policy stance today. 
Conclusion 
Inflation has dropped like a stone over the past year, to close to zero. This largely, but not 
wholly, reflects external forces. On the MPC’s central view, inflation will remain close to zero 
in the near-term, before rising to reach the inflation target over a two-year horizon. The risks 
to inflation at that horizon are plainly two-sided. But my personal view is that these risks are 
skewed to the downside. In my  view, that means policy needs to stand ready to  move off 
either foot in the period ahead to meet the symmetric inflation target. 
Thank you.
