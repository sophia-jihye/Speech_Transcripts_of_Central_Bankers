Introduction 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you all today. It’s wonderful to be back at the 
Australia National University (ANU) and an honour to give this lecture that promotes 
discussion between academics and policy practitioners.  
 
Today, I would like to explore how changes in household behaviour– in particular saving1 
and debt dynamics – are influencing inflationary pressures. 
 
Nearly ten years on from the start of the global financial crisis (GFC), some advanced 
economies are still struggling to reach the “escape velocity” needed to ensure that the 
economy grows above trend and generates a path of inflation that is consistent with central 
bank inflation targets.  Despite extraordinary monetary accommodation in these advanced 
economies, economic growth remains disappointingly weak.   
 
Something seems to be different on the demand side of the economy since the GFC, and is 
challenging inflation modelling and inflation targeting frameworks.  Estimates of the real 
neutral interest rate – that is the real interest rate consistent with the economy growing at full 
employment and achieving price stability over the medium term – have declined materially.2 
Some commentators suggest that nominal interest rates will remain low for years to come. 
 
Views vary as to the nature of the changing dynamics of aggregate demand. Some 
economists posit that we are now in an era of “secular stagnation”, with a persistent 
deficiency in aggregate demand.3  Others point to an overhang from earlier excessive debt 
accumulation and suggest that demand is being depressed by a lengthy period of 
deleveraging.4  Irrespective of the reasons for the weak demand, several supply-side 
arguments point to lower rates of growth in the labour force, innovation, and productivity, and 
consequently investment and output growth. In my address, however, I will focus solely on 
the demand side of the economy. 
 
While there are many common features to the international picture, there are also notable 
differences.  In advanced economies, investment has generally been weak at a time when 
the household sector’s consumption-saving balance has not materially altered.   
 
    3 
 A different picture, however, emerges in Australasia.  As in other advanced economies, 
private debt levels rose rapidly in the early part of the twenty-first century, due to strong 
household credit growth.  But, since the GFC, private debt levels have tended to stabilise 
and the household saving rate has increased.  This is despite a large increase in wealth 
associated with rising house and equity prices. 
  
The path of consumption and the relationship between consumption and wealth is crucial to 
the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s (RBNZ) 
assessment of business cycle dynamics and inflation prospects.  Indeed, weaker spending 
out of wealth than expected is part of the reason why inflation has been lower than forecast 
in New Zealand.  To what extent heightened saving preferences represent a permanent shift 
or a prolonged deleveraging adjustment is uncertain, though some indicators provide 
tentative support to the view that it represents a prolonged cyclical correction. 
 
In this address, I will briefly review international demand dynamics, before drawing a New 
Zealand and Australian perspective.  I will then examine the changes in New Zealand’s 
saving behaviour and debt dynamics since the GFC, before turning to the implications for the 
RBNZ’s inflation modelling and forecasting. 
 
Increased saving or lower investment? 
 
Since 2008, OECD economies have grown more slowly relative to previous expansions 
(figure 1).  Over the past seven years, growth has averaged 1.2 percent compared to 2.6 
percent in the decade preceding the GFC. A similar picture emerges when comparing 
relative rates of consumption growth. Lower economic growth has been associated with 
lower neutral interest rates.  The extent to which this reflects lower growth in aggregate 
demand or higher saving is unclear, as is the extent to whether it is a prolonged cyclical 
phenomenon or a permanent shift in growth rates.5 Summers (2016) believes that long-term 
secular forces are at play that raise desired saving and reduce the propensity to invest, 
thereby driving down long-run equilibrium interest rates.

An increased propensity to save could reflect many factors.  For example, stronger 
precautionary motives in light of the severe global recession (due to upgraded assessments 
of financial and employment risk); demographic shifts towards higher saving households; 
greater saving related to population ageing and longer lives; more-binding credit constraints 
associated with higher debt levels; rising income inequality; and potentially a downgrading of 
future prospects for investment returns and growth. 
 
A lower propensity to invest might reflect lower rates of innovation and productivity growth, 
lower expected investment returns,7 less capital-intensive technologies, and structural 
change towards less capital-intensive service industries.  
 
An alternative explanation proffered by Rogoff (amongst others) is that our economies are 
experiencing a prolonged period of deleveraging (in the public and private sectors), aimed at 
winding back excessive debt accumulation from the period preceding the GFC.  In this 
scenario, national saving would be higher and growth in investment lower (or at least credit-
financed investment) for many years.  
 
What does the evidence suggest?8  For advanced economies as a whole, national saving 
has not altered significantly over the last 25 years and, if anything, have declined slightly 
    5 
(figure 2). The savings-glut hypothesis proposed by Bernanke and others was associated 
with the large build-up of savings from China in the mid-2000s, much of which ended up 
financing higher United States (US) spending.  However, more recently, China’s national 
saving rate has moderated, while in advanced economies saving rates have recovered 
towards pre-GFC levels.

The US personal saving data illustrates these developments. Between 1991 and the onset of 
the GFC in 2008, the personal saving rate as a share of household disposable income fell by 
5.4 percentage points.9 This trend decline coincided with a large rise in house prices and 
build-up in household debt. Debt ratios deteriorated due to increased access to new financial 
products, the baby-boom generation transitioning towards middle age, and educational 
attainment for the population was rising (Dynan and Kohn, 2007).  Following the GFC, the 
large decline in house prices led to a reassessment of household balance sheets and an 
associated cutback in consumption.10 
 
While national saving in the advanced economies has broadly recovered since the crisis, the 
weakness in investment has been striking.  After being relatively stable as a share of GDP 
through the 1990s and early 2000s, the investment ratio tumbled in the GFC and has risen 
only marginally since (figure 3).  The US investment ratio has recovered only modestly 
despite low financing costs, and as at 2016 remains 1.4 percentage points lower than its pre-
crisis average level between 1990 and 2005. 
 
    6 
 On the face of this data, the reduced propensity to invest appears to have more power than 
heightened saving behaviour in explaining the weak aggregate demand story, at least for the 
advanced economies grouping.

Household and government sector debt has risen significantly as a share of GDP since 
1990.  A reasonably sharp deleveraging in household debt has been observed in the US 
since the GFC, followed by modest deleveraging in the UK and Germany, but this appears to 
be an exception to the general pattern observed for advanced economies where debt-to-
GDP has been broadly flat (figure 4). These trends are broadly consistent with slow credit 
growth, in part due to tighter financial regulation and the diminished appetite for debt in the 
private sector.  Bank credit in the private non-financial sector for advanced economies has 
barely expanded since 2008, while it grew at an annual rate of 8 percent in the eight years 
preceding the crisis.11 Elevated debt levels may have inhibited credit, investment and 
consumption growth, but significant deleveraging is not yet apparent in the aggregate data 
(Buttliglione, Lane, Reichin and Reinhart, 2014).

Australasian trends 
 
In contrast to some other advanced economies, New Zealand and Australia have 
experienced fairly stable investment-to-GDP ratios and uplift in saving, especially by the 
household sector. 
 
Relative to international trends, the Australasian investment story has been stronger with 
investment ratios now close to their pre-crisis average (figure 5).  Both countries benefitted 
from large commodity price gains, and Australia experienced an extraordinary mining 
investment boom. New Zealand also experienced a surge in residential investment following 
the Canterbury earthquake and in response to the acute shortage of housing in Auckland.13 
But even beyond these sectoral shocks there are no obvious signs that the propensity to 
invest has weakened.

In Australia and New Zealand, weaker-than-expected demand has come via lower-than-
expected consumption growth relative to income and, in particular, relative to wealth.  
Notwithstanding a smaller financial crisis than experienced in many advanced economies, 
Australasian households appear to have adopted a new-found prudence. 
 
One indicator of this is the net foreign liability position, which for New Zealand has fallen 
from a peak of 84 percent of GDP in March 2009 to around 65 percent of GDP in the 2016 
June quarter. This reflects a narrowing current account deficit over the period resulting from 
higher national saving. In addition, there was a sharp narrowing in the investment income 
deficit (from 6.3 percent to 3.7 percent of GDP) as interest on foreign debt declined. In 
Australia, national saving began rising in 2004 and eventually peaked at 24.8 percent of 
GDP in 2011, contributing to a narrowing in the current account deficit since the mid-2000s. 
National saving has eased slightly in recent years, but the current account deficit and net 
foreign liability position have remained broadly stable.  
 
Turning more directly to the household sector, Australia’s household saving rate increased 
from around zero in 2003 to an average of about 7 percent of disposable income thereafter 
(figure 6). New Zealand also saw a recovery in the household saving rate from a trough of    
-6.8 percent in 2003 to 2.4 percent in 2012.  
     9 
Over a longer-term context it is striking that the 1990s and early 2000s were an exceptional 
period of low or negative saving. For example, in Australia, the personal saving rate has 
averaged about 10 percent since 1960 and was as high as 19 percent in 1973. In New 
Zealand, household saving averaged 4 percent of household disposable income from 1987 
to 1994, and was then negative for most years until 2010.

Decomposing changes in household saving  
 
Why has household saving increased?  A number of explanations are plausible as I 
highlighted earlier. It is not my intention to examine these hypotheses comprehensively 
today.  But I will point to some promising lines of inquiry by reviewing how different 
household groups have behaved before and after the GFC.   
  
The RBA recently examined the rise in the Australian household saving ratio between 2003-
04 and 2009-10 by examining saving behaviour for different household groupings (Finlay 
and Price, 2014). They found that the propensity to save rose most for households reliant on 
less secure sources of income, or who are more vulnerable to asset price shocks, indicating 
a greater degree of risk aversion and thus heightened precautionary motives. University 
educated households also increased their propensity to save relative to high school 
educated households, which the authors suggested could reflect a downward reassessment 
of future income prospects by higher-educated households. Wealthy households and those 
with high debt levels displayed an increased propensity to save, reflecting a desire to rebuild 
    10 
 wealth following the asset price shock during the crisis, and a more prudent attitude towards 
debt.  
 
We have recently undertaken similar analysis for New Zealand using Household Economic 
Survey (HES) data that compares consumption and saving across households at the peak of 
the last cycle (2007) and some five years after the recession (2013).15 Whilst the HES 
provides a flawed estimate of aggregate household saving relative to national accounts 
data,16 it is reasonably consistent in its methodology over time, affording a useful 
decomposition of changes in saving patterns.   
 
The HES data shows a smaller increase in the median saving ratio relative to the rise in the 
overall level of saving (or the aggregate saving ratio). This appears to be explained by much 
lower dissaving among individuals below the median as opposed to higher saving among 
those above the median.  The saving ratios at the top end of the saving distribution are 
largely unchanged (figure 7).

Similar to Australia, saving rose much more sharply for higher educated households (those 
holding a degree), suggesting a downward assessment of future income prospects, such 
that much of the income growth over the period was saved.17 Another parallel with the 
    11 
 Australian study is the significant reduction in dissaving amongst those with the highest debt-
to-income (DTI) ratio (figure 8), supporting the notion of a debt overhang and a desire 
amongst such households to lower their debt ratios, or a reduced supply of lending to such 
households. 
 
These studies suggest there is tentative evidence of a recent shift in saving behaviour in 
Australasia owing to pessimism around income growth and the negative shock to wealth 
emanating from the GFC.  The former would suggest a more enduring change, while the 
latter is more consistent with a prolonged cyclical adjustment.  
 
In both countries, there is no obvious sign that ageing demographics (i.e. an increasing 
concentration of middle-aged households with higher saving rates) had a strong influence 
over the change in saving behaviour during the period.  When adjusted for changes in the 
age composition of households, the aggregate saving ratio in 2013 was only marginally 
lower than the unadjusted rate, implying that most of the (large increase) was due to 
economic factors.18 Correspondingly, the increase in the saving rate was smaller amongst 
the 50-64 year old age cohort than it was for the 30-49 cohort or the 65+ group.

Consumption and wealth 
 
In absolute terms, real consumption growth has not been noticeably weak since the crisis, 
with annual real consumption growth in both countries similar to its long-term average of 
around 2.5 percent.  However, population growth has been rapid and thus real consumption 
per capita has grown by only 1.2 percent and 0.8 percent per annum on average since 2008 
in New Zealand and Australia respectively (figure 9), well below its long-term average.  
Moreover, this modest per capita consumption growth has occurred when wealth, namely 
housing wealth, has been rising rapidly.

In the early 2000s, rapid increases in housing wealth were associated with strong growth in 
credit and consumption.  A number of analyses focused on the mechanism of “housing 
equity withdrawal” whereby households either borrowed against rising housing wealth or 
sold down to realise the gains and potentially to finance general consumption.21 Equity 
withdrawal represents one mechanism for dissaving and, for New Zealand, this dynamic can 
be observed in figure 10.  
 
It is clear that net equity withdrawal from housing wealth has so far been confined to the 
early to mid-2000s, which coincided with strong household consumption growth and a fall in 
the household saving rate. Although there has been a large rise in housing wealth in New 
Zealand and associated credit expansion since 2013, equity withdrawal has not eventuated 
according to our measure. The introduction of loan-to-value restrictions for housing loans 
    13 
 since 2013 has likely played a part in offsetting credit growth related to the resurgence in 
housing market activity. Likewise in Australia, housing equity withdrawal was only a 
phenomenon that occurred in the early to mid-2000s (Kent, 2015).

The reduced tendency to take on debt secured against the rise in the value of housing 
wealth has meant that we have not witnessed a rise in household indebtedness to quite the 
same extent that occurred prior to the crisis – at least not until very recently. New Zealand 
household debt rose from 60 percent of household disposable income in 1990 to 100 
percent in 2000 and 160 percent in 2008 (figure 11).  Post GFC, it then declined modestly in 
relation to income but has risen again recently, reaching 165 percent of household income in 
June 2016. Australia has exhibited a similar but slightly higher household debt track. In both 
countries, the ratios to income have been affected by commodity price movements, initially 
favourably and then negatively by lowering entrepreneurial incomes. The ratios to wealth are 
less affected.

What might we infer from this broad stabilisation in debt levels for consumption and 
aggregate demand relative to the period leading up to the GFC?  On its own, it doesn’t 
portend a significant tendency towards deleveraging. On the other hand, given the very large 
house price and wealth movements observed, the increase in household debt appears more 
modest relative to the previous cycle.  This is consistent with the observed increase in 
saving, in part indicating greater caution on the behalf of households. Even when compared 
with financial wealth alone, household debt declined after the GFC, only increasing very 
recently.   
 
Undoubtedly, financial liberalisation and persistently lower nominal interest rates have 
supported greater debt accumulation, and this appears a marked phenomenon of the  
1990s-2000s.  The trend in debt levels appears to have plateaued, although the very recent 
observations make this less clear (household credit growth ran at 8.5 percent annually in the 
three months to August 2016). 
 
Nevertheless, the concern from a financial stability viewpoint is a high concentration of debt 
in the housing market, particularly when house prices are significantly over-stretched against 
conventional metrics, such as income. High and rising debt levels amongst households 
leave them increasingly vulnerable to a deterioration in economic conditions or normalisation 
of currently-low mortgage rates. 
 
To assess more rigorously whether the household sector has exhibited lower consumption 
out of wealth than it did during the “excessive” 2000s, we have undertaken some updated 
    15 
 econometric modelling.23  The new work includes improved measures of household wealth 
and data since the GFC.  We estimate the long-run per-capita relationship between the level 
of consumption and the levels of housing and financial wealth and income from 1986 to 
2016, and then examine the estimates for stability (or structural change).24  
 
The relationship is estimated using a split sample before and after 2005 where the housing 
market and housing equity withdrawal was near its peak. The parameter on income and 
housing fell by 32 percent and 50 percent respectively since 2005, while the parameter on 
financial wealth increased25. This implies that for any given increase in income or housing 
wealth, consumption increases by less, indicating more cautious consumer behaviour since 
the mid-2000s.26 The change in behaviour may reflect a reassessment of expected future 
capital gains from different forms of wealth following the crisis, particularly given heightened 
uncertainty in the housing market, and greater precaution about the stability or durability of 
income growth. 
 
How has the increase in saving affected inflation and monetary policy? 
 
In the standard New Keynesian model, monetary policy responds to shocks that affect 
inflation by setting interest rates to influence the gap between actual economic activity and 
its long run, sustainable level. When the level of output is below potential and inflation is 
falling, as it is currently for most advanced economies,27 a reduction in interest rates 
accelerates investment and consumption, bringing forward spending from future periods to 
raise output. 
 
This orthodoxy assumes that current demand conditions and real interest rates are low for 
temporary reasons rather than reflecting any long-term structural shift in demand or 
productivity growth that would deter consumers and investors from responding to lower 
policy-induced interest rates. Strong forms of the secular stagnation hypothesis would argue 
that an interest rate adjustment is ineffective in inducing an inter-temporal shift in demand 
when consumers and investors anticipate, let alone experience, near-zero long-run interest 
rates.  A weaker form would acknowledge that the neutral real interest rate has fallen 
transitorily, requiring a lower policy rate than previously - a complication for economies close 
to or at the zero lower bound. 
 
In New Zealand, there are a couple of reasons why the secular stagnation hypothesis 
appears unsupported.  Potential output growth has substantially recovered from cyclical lows 
and has not inhibited actual GDP growth to the extent that it has in many other advanced 
    16 
economies. In saying that, potential output growth has still been slower in the current cycle 
relative to the previous two (figure 12), consistent with some reduction in the neutral interest 
rate. This is largely due to a much weaker contribution from total factor productivity and 
growth in the capital stock relative to the past two cycles.  Much of the improvement in 
potential GDP in the current cycle is accounted for by the growth in labour supply owing to 
greater labour force participation and high net immigration. New Zealand is not currently 
exhibiting signs of a demographic slowdown that is besetting many advanced economies 
(population growth in the year to June 2016 was 2.1 percent).

Secondly, there is no strong evidence to suggest that aggregate demand growth is less 
responsive to interest rate adjustments.28 The stimulus from low interest rates appears to be 
supporting house prices and construction sector activity via residential investment in line with 
previous cycles (even after accounting for the Canterbury earthquake 
reconstruction).29  Construction sector activity continues to have a strong influence on the 
output gap. Although consumption growth per capita has been weaker than projected since 
2013, this is partly explained by exaggerated expectations rooted in the housing cycle of the 
early 2000s. We have observed a lower propensity to consume out of housing wealth and an 
increase in household saving to more moderate levels since the GFC. With hindsight, it 
    17 
appears over-optmistic to have extrapolated the experience of the 1990s and early 2000s 
when debt accumulation and consumption out of wealth was exorbitant. 
 
As we have explained elsewhere (McDermott, 2016), New Zealand’s very low inflation has 
reflected negative traded goods inflation over the past 5 years.  Non-tradables inflation has 
been slightly lower than expected, largely due to more rapid growth in supply capacity (and 
especially labour supply) than projected. That said, projections of demand arising from 
historical estimates of consumption from wealth have been over-optimistic, contributing to 
downward revisions to forecasts of the output gap. Weaker spending than expected out of 
wealth is part of the reason why inflation has been lower than forecast. We have been 
gradually incorporating the weaker relationship between consumption and housing wealth in 
our projections in recent Monetary Policy Statements, as our understanding of household 
behaviour has improved.  
 
Conclusion 
 
A number of hypotheses are available to help explain the persistently low economic growth 
in the advanced economies since the GFC. Secular stagnation in aggregate demand 
associated with excess saving and a long-term decline in the real neutral rate of interest is 
favoured by some.  Prolonged – but nonetheless temporary – adjustment to debt overhang 
is an alternative proposition.   
 
In my speech today, I’ve contrasted Australian and New Zealand debt and household 
dynamics with those observed in other advanced economies. Since the GFC, Australasia 
has witnessed a moderation in debt accumulation, a return to historical (pre-2000) saving 
behaviour, and steady output growth. Saving appears to have risen more sharply amongst 
the most heavily-indebted households.  While house price inflation has been strong and 
housing credit growth robust, this appears to reflect portfolio adjustment – an asset price 
response to low interest rates – and rapid population growth.  This cycle has not seen the 
pattern of equity withdrawal that characterised the excessive growth in leverage of the early 
2000s. Modelling suggests that the elasticity of household spending in response to housing 
wealth has moderated since 2005.    
 
Overall, the developments in Australia and New Zealand are more consistent with a debt 
overhang hypothesis, a la Rogoff, than secular stagnation, a la Summers.  Moreover, rather 
than indicating a new low-growth paradigm, they tend to imply that extrapolations of high 
growth expectations from the 2000s were misplaced.  High investment and consumption 
     18 
 growth rooted in low world interest rates generated by increased savings primarily from 
Asian countries, and especially China, temporarily boosted growth and asset markets. In 
Australasia, the current outlook looks a lot like that which prevailed before the 2000s. In 
other advanced economies, weak investment growth coupled with a disappointing expansion 
in the supply side of the economy points to a world more consistent with lower long-term 
growth expectations.    
 
We have been taking into account the change in household behaviour in our modelling of 
inflation and our policy settings.  Allowing for the increase we have seen, the links between 
interest rates, output and inflation appear stable. Nonetheless we will be attentive that such 
developments are not foreshadowing any greater or longer term change in household 
preferences. Currently, we are projecting per-capita consumption growth to improve and 
provide an impetus to output growth. The acceleration is modest compared to the previous 
cycle as household saving is expected to remain positive over the forecast horizon.  Despite 
robust domestic growth, slow growth in many other advanced economies suggests that 
global disinflationary pressures will continue to act as a headwind as we endeavour to 
deliver domestic inflationary outcomes consistent with the midpoint of our target band.

5 Estimates for potential growth in advanced economies for the period 2016-2021 have fallen by 0.4 percentage 
points over the past two years, reflecting both lower factor growth and lower total factor productivity growth (IMF, 
2016).  
6 The expansions correspond to periods following global recessions, as identified by IMF (2009), while also 
including the dot-com crash of 2001 that coincided with mild recessions in many advanced economies.  
7 Investment profitability appears to have declined since the crisis and the spread between equity and sovereign 
bond returns has widened, implying rising risk premia (IMF, 2014). 
8 Rachel and Smith (2015) provide a comprehensive exposition of the multiple hypotheses for the decline in the 
global long-run real interest rate through shifts in the saving and investment schedules, generally treating the 
changes as enduring.  They evaluate the estimated 450 basis point fall in the long-run real rate of interest since 
the 1980s with 100 basis points due to lower trend growth, 140 basis points through reduced investment demand 
and 160 basis points through shifts towards higher saving.  They observe that in advanced economies lower 
investment demand appears to play a larger role, while in emerging market economies the shift upwards in 
saving preferences is larger.

10 Kaplan, Mitman and Violante (2016) estimates that a 30 percent decline in house prices was reflected in a 3.1 
percent decline in nondurables consumption from 2007 to 2011. Kaplan et al. (2016) find no effect of initial debt 
levels on consumption.

12 We focus on changes in the household debt-to-GDP ratio rather than the level given measurement and 
institutional differences as discussed in Hunt (2014). 
13 The share of construction investment relative to potential output in New Zealand has increased by 3 
percentage points since the crisis. 
14 Other advanced economies include: Australia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hong Kong (SAR), Iceland, Israel, 
Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, San Marino, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan (Province of China). The 
pre-crisis period is 1990 to 2005.

study are the work of the author, not Statistics New Zealand. 
16 For example the aggregate household saving rate in the HES was 14 percent in 2007 and 26 percent in 2013, 
compared with national accounts estimates of -4 percent and 2 percent. 
17 The analysis did not identify education-related debt. It is unclear whether this is a factor in this result. 
18 A New Zealand study by Vink (2016) found that the rise in the proportion of the population in prime-saving age 
groups contributed only one quarter to the overall trend increase in the aggregate HES saving rate between 1984 
and 2010. The remaining three quarters of the aggregate trend increase is attributable to the rise in average 
saving rates of successive cohorts born since 1930.

22 We follow the methodology in Smith (2006) where housing equity withdrawal is defined as the change in 
mortgage lending plus capital grants minus housing investment. Housing investment includes residential 
investment in dwellings, household transfer costs, transfers of dwellings to the household sector, and net 
transfers of land to the household sector. Capital grants include Kiwisaver first home withdrawals and Home Start 
grants since their introduction in 2011. Estimated residential investment and residential insurance pay-outs 
relating to the Canterbury rebuild have been excluded, as the related fluctuations in equity may not represent 
changes in household behaviour.

24 For details of the cointegration estimation framework, see De Veirman & Dunstan (2008).  The full-period 
analysis suggests that a 1 percent increase in real per-capita housing wealth is associated with a 0.20 percent 
increase in real per-capita consumption on average, while the long-run income elasticity is 0.47 percent. The 
marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth is almost twice that of financial wealth (0.12 percent), 
although this difference in magnitude was much lower than that found in De Veirman & Dunstan (2008). 
    20 
                                                                                                                                                   
25 The increase in the coefficient on financial wealth is difficult to interpret as it was not well defined (statistically 
significant) in the pre-2005 sample.  In other results, excluding farm income that is highly variable, the parameter 
on financial wealth is more stable and statistically significant across the split samples.  
26 Given potential instability in the long-run relationship, which may undermine the cointegration approach, the 
wealth effects are also estimated using an alternative approach developed by Carroll, Otsuka, and Slacalek 
(2011). The result is similar to the baseline in that the marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth has 
fallen in the split sample post-2005, while it increased for financial wealth.  
27 The IMF (2016) estimated an output gap of -0.8 percent (as a percentage of potential GDP) for advanced 
economies in 2016, improving from a trough of -3.8 percent in 2009. 
28 Modelling work in the RBNZ has found the response of the output gap to an interest rate shock since the GFC 
is not statistically different from the pre-GFC period.   
29 Similar results for Australia were reported by Kent (2015).
