Real incomes falling for a decade. 
The legacy of a searing financial crisis weighing on confidence and growth. 
The very nature of work disrupted by a technological revolution. 
This was the middle of the 19th century. 
Liverpool was in the midst of a golden age; its Custom House was the national Exchequer’s biggest source 
of revenue.  
And Karl Marx was scribbling in the British Library, warning of a spectre haunting Europe, the spectre of 
communism.  
We meet today during the first lost decade since the 1860s. 
In the wake of a global financial crisis.  
And in the midst of a technological revolution that is once again changing the nature of work. 
Substitute Northern Rock for Overend Gurney; Uber and machine learning for the Spinning Jenny and the 
steam engine; and Twitter for the telegraph; and you have dynamics that echo those of 150 years ago. 
Then the villains were the capitalists.  Should they today be the central bankers?  Are their flights of fancy 
promoting stagnation and inequality?  Does the spectre of monetarism haunt our economies?i   
These are serious charges, based on real anxieties.  They merit sober, objective assessment. 
This evening I want to discuss the role of monetary policy in this time of great disruption. But first I will focus 
on the underlying causes and consequences of weak real income growth and inequality across the 
advanced world. 
That’s because any doctor knows that the importance of diagnosing the underlying causes of the patient’s 
symptoms before administering the cure.  Monetary policy has been keeping the patient alive, creating the 
possibility of a lasting cure through fiscal and structural operations.  It has averted depression and helped 
advanced economies live to fight another day, so that measures to restore vitality can be taken.  
II. The Great Disruption 
During the last quarter century there have been a series of profound disruptions to the way we work, trade, 
consume and live.  The fall of the Berlin Wall and the reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping led to the 
integration of a third of humankind into the global labour force.  Those workers are increasingly linked by 
global supply chains that have spread from goods to services.  In parallel, an explosion of technological 
innovations has brought access, at the click of a virtual button, to the sum of human knowledge to three-and-
a-half billion people (Chart 1).

global poverty line. 
 Globally, since 1960, real per capita GDP has risen more than two-and-a-half times (Chart 3), average 
incomes have begun to converge, ii and life expectancy has increased by nearly two decades (Chart 4).  
Despite such immense progress, many citizens in advanced economies are facing heightened uncertainty, 
lamenting a loss of control and losing trust in the system. To them, measures of aggregate progress bear 
little relation to their own experience. Rather than a new golden era, globalisation is associated with low 
wages, insecure employment, stateless corporations and striking inequalities.   
These anxieties have been compounded by the twin crises of solvency and integrity at the heart of finance.  
When the financial crisis hit, the world’s largest banks were shown to be operating in a “heads-I-win-tails-
you-lose” bubble; widespread rigging of some core markets was exposed; and masters of the universe 
became minions.  Few in positions of responsibility took theirs.  Shareholders, taxpayers and citizens paid 
the heavy price. 
As a consequence of all these developments, public support for open markets is under threat.  
Turning our backs on open markets would be a tragedy, but it is a possibility.  It can only be averted by 
confronting the underlying reasons for this risk upfront.

 Real income growth has been meagre, compounding unequal distribution.  
The cry for more inclusive growth starts with a crisis of growth itself.  To put it mildly, the performance of the 
advanced economies over the past ten years has consistently disappointed (Chart 5).

History tells us that recoveries from financial crisis are weak, with a typical hit of around 1 percentage point 
off per capita GDP growth each year for a decade.iii Globally, we are tracking that pattern, with overall activity 
9% below its pre-crisis trend nine years on. 
Even by these standards, however, advanced economy recoveries have been unusually tepid, with their 
current level of activity around 13% lower than the pre-crisis trend. 
In the UK the shortfall, at 16%, is even worse.  Over the past decade real earnings have grown at the 
slowest rate since the mid-19th Century (Chart 6). 
Weak income growth has focused growing attention on its distribution.  Inequalities which might have been 
tolerated during generalised prosperity are felt more acutely when economies stagnate.   
In recent decades, as global inequality has fallen markedly, it has edged ever higher in most advanced 
economies. In Anglo-Saxon countries, the income share of the top 1% has risen notably since 1980. Today, 
in the US, the richest 1% of households receive 20% of all income.iv

 Such high income inequalities are dwarfed by staggering wealth inequalities. The proportion of the wealth 
held by the richest 1% of Americans increased from 25% in 1990 to 40% in 2012.v Globally, the share of 
wealth held by the richest 1% in the world rose from one-third in 2000 to one-half in 2010.vi 
The picture in the UK is complex but in general suggests relatively stable but high levels of overall inequality, 
with sharper disparities emerging in recent times for the top 1%. When combined with low growth of incomes 
and entrenched intergenerational inequity, it is no wonder that many question their prospects.

For example, a common measure of the distribution of income, the Gini coefficient, shows that inequality 
rose sharply during the 1980s and has more or less plateaued ever since (Chart 7). That suggests a large 
structural shift during the Thatcher era, followed by a more modest series of adjustments thereafter. 
However, possibly because of the effects of globalisation, the income share of the top 1% tripled from 5% in 
the early 1980s to 15% by 2009, though it has fallen back somewhat since the crisis (Chart 8).  
The distribution of wealth also appears to have been relatively flat since the mid-1990s (Chart 9), partly 
reflecting the pattern of home ownership,vii though it is much less equal than for income, with the share of the 
richest 1% persistently high, at around 20%.viii  
For both income and wealth, some of the most significant shifts have happened across generations. A typical 
millennial earned £8,000 less during their twenties than their predecessors.ix Since 2007, those over 60 have 
seen their incomes rise at five times the rate of the population as a whole.x Moreover, rising real house 
prices between the mid-1990s and the late 2000s has created a growing disparity between older home 
owners and younger renters (Chart 10). 
Chart 7: Income inequality in the UK rose 
notably in the 1980s, then plateaued… 
Chart 8: … yet the income share of the top 1% 
rose steadily to reach 15% in 2009, before

All of this matters. As the community groups here in Liverpool will attest, and more formal studies of people’s 
happiness find, subjective well-being is significantly affected by perceptions of inequality and the sense of

 III. The Way Forward 
Given these developments, the challenge is how to manage and moderate the forces of innovation and 
integration which breed aggregate prosperity for the economy as a whole but which also foster isolation and 
detachment for substantial proportions of the population.  
In the balance of my remarks, I will focus on three priorities for doing so. 
First, economists must clearly acknowledge the challenges we face, including the realities of uneven 
gains from trade and technology.   
Second, we must grow our economy by rebalancing the mix of monetary policy, fiscal policy and 
structural reforms. 
Third, we need to move towards more inclusive growth where everyone has a stake in globalisation.

Most potential solutions lie outside the Bank’s remit.  But let me say a bit about each of these priorities 
concentrating on how the Bank of England can contribute to more inclusive growth via the impact of its 
policies on uncertainty, trust and inequality.    
(a)  Acknowledge current challenges and address them, wherever possible. 
Given their recent experiences, it is not surprising that people are largely ignoring pieties about the virtues of 
open markets and new technologies, and that they discount assertions that “they’ve never had it so good.”  A 
more inclusive growth requires frank talk about risks and concrete initiatives to help people adjust to new 
realities.  
Trade and technology do not raise all boats 
Consider the disconnect between economists and workers.  The former have not been sufficiently upfront 
about the distributional consequences of rapid changes in technology and globalisation. Amongst 
economists, a belief in free trade is totemic.xiv But, while trade makes countries better off, it does not raise all 
boats; in the clinical words of the economist, trade is not Pareto optimal.xv   
Rather, the benefits from trade are unequally spread across individuals and time.  Consumers get lower 
prices and new product varieties, and, over time, benefit from the spur to innovate and higher productivity.  
Some workers, however, lose their jobs and the dignity of work, or see their “factor prices” – in plain English, 
wages – equalised downwards.  
Such dynamics have been recognised by trade theory for over 75 years.xvi  And they are felt by those at 
either end of the great convergence.  Survey evidence shows that 70% of Chinese workers believe that trade 
creates jobs and increases wages,xvii US households think the opposite, and UK public opinion is 
equivocal.xviii 
People’s attitudes towards trade shocks are being hardened by the effects of accelerating technological 
innovation.  As my colleague Andy Haldane has explained, up to 15 million of the current jobs in Britain could 
be automated over time.xix 
The fundamental challenge is that, alongside its great benefits, every technological revolution mercilessly 
destroys jobs and livelihoods – and therefore identities – well before the new ones emerge. This was true of 
the eclipse of agriculture and cottage industry by the industrial revolution, the displacement of manufacturing 
by the service economy, and now the hollowing out of many of those middle-class services jobs through 
machine learning and global sourcing.  
The combination of open markets and technology means that returns in a globalised world amplifies the 
rewards of the superstar and the lucky.  Now may be the time of the famous or fortunate, but what of the 
frustrated and frightened?

Uncertainty is very high 
From the rising spectre of global terrorism to intensifying geopolitical tensions and financial crises, for too 
long, for far too many people, the world seems to be getting riskier. 
They are right. Currently, on average across Europe and the US, policy uncertainty is around 1.5 standard 
deviations above its historical average.xx In the UK, we expect currently elevated levels of uncertainty to cut 
7% from investment over the next three years and 1% from GDP. 
Higher uncertainty has contributed to what psychologists call an affect heuristic amongst households, 
businesses and investors.  Put simply, long after the original trigger becomes remote, perceptions endure, 
affecting risk perceptions and economic behaviour. Just like those who lived through the Great Depression, 
people appear more cautious about the future and more reluctant to take irreversible decisions. 
That means less willingness to put capital to work and, ultimately, lower growth. 
These dynamics are clearly visible in financial markets. As one illustration, for two-and-a-half centuries, the 
prices of government bonds and the prices of equities tended to move together: the typical bull market 
entails rising equity prices and falling bond yields, with the reverse in bear markets (Chart 11). Since the 
mid-2000s, however, this pattern has reversed and bond yields have tended to fall along with equity prices.xxi

 This unprecedented desire for safety has helped to drive down the equilibrium interest rate – the interest rate 
central banks must deliver in order to balance demand with supply and so achieve stable inflation. In this 
sense, low policy interest rates are not the caprice of central bankers, but rather the consequence of 
powerful global forces, including debt, demographics and distribution.xxii

Those same forces are contributing to deficits in defined-benefit pensions.  The value of these schemes’ 
investments in equities and real estate are low relative to the level of interest rates because investors are 
valuing safety much more than they are expecting faster growth. 
Said differently, since pensions are future claims on the economy, there isn’t a parallel universe of higher 
interest rates, higher growth and equity prices, and lower pension deficits.  That is, there isn’t without real 
structural reform.  Blaming monetary policy avoids these hard truths. 
 Speaking hard truths is part of how central banks can reinforce the foundations of more inclusive growth.  
The paradox is that one of our jobs is to reduce uncertainty by identifying risks.  
This requires coming straight with the public as the Bank of England did around the EU referendum.  
And it requires being clear about what we cannot do. Long-run prosperity is not in the gift of central bankers. 
It depends on a much wider set of initiatives of our elected representatives, and ultimately, on the actions of 
the private sector.  
(b)  Monetary Policy, Distribution and Equity 
The second way central banks can promote inclusive growth is as part of a balanced mix of 
monetary, fiscal and structural policies.   
Globally, this balance has been absent since the crisis, with disproportionate weight falling on monetary 
policy.  What has that meant for growth and inequality? 
Before answering, it is important to recognise two facts.  
First, by law, monetary policy must target the national rate of consumer price inflation, while taking into 
account as a secondary consideration its impact on other important macroeconomic variables, such as 
growth, employment and financial stability. Monetary policy cannot target a particular region, industry or 
segment of the population.   
Second, all monetary policy has distributional effects, but it is rightly the role of elected governments to take 
measures to offset them if they so choose.  
In that context, has monetary policy worsened income distributions, made savers poorer, inflated asset 
prices, or exacerbated wealth inequalities?    
I want to review these claims by examining the cold, hard facts around:  
 the foundational contributions that monetary policy makes to the good of the people of the UK;   
  how effective monetary policy has been in achieving macroeconomic outcomes since the crisis; and

     what have been the associated developments in the distribution of income and wealth - the financial 
outcomes - since extraordinary monetary policies were first implemented. 
Reinforcing the foundations 
Any assessment of the distributional consequences of monetary policy must recognise that the negative 
effects of unemployment and volatile inflation fall predominantly on the poorest in society. 
High inflation hurts those, typically the less well off, who don’t hold equities or property or whose incomes are 
fixed in nominal terms.xxiii 
Equally, if inflation is too low in a highly indebted economy, dynamics can quickly develop that raise real 
interest rates, increase debt burdens, lower wages, and reduce growth. In extreme, these can morph into 
debt deflation, causing very high and persistent unemployment.  Again, the highly indebted tend to be less 
well off, and to pay the heaviest price. 
The happy medium is a monetary policy framework with a credible commitment to low, stable, predictable 
inflation over the medium term, as in the UK’s tried and tested arrangements.  These give monetary policy 
the space to respond to shocks, while avoiding the distortionary effects of volatile inflation.

 Experience shows that when the economy enters recession, the poorest are hit the hardest. During

And recessions disproportionately affect the young (Chart 12).xxv Graduating in a recession is generally bad 
news for someone’s earnings trajectory (Chart 13). The most advantaged graduates tend, over time, to 
recover, but the least advantaged can be permanently affected.xxvi   
In the extreme, prolonged recessions can lead to permanent labour market scarring, with potentially 
devastating effects on livelihoods, identities and communities.xxvii 
That is perhaps why studies of expansionary monetary actions generally find they reduce, not increase, 
inequality while raising demand and supporting jobs.xxviii  And there appears to be little evidence that 
stimulative monetary policy makes groups worse off. 
Do these lessons apply to the most recent UK recession and recovery? 
Macroeconomic Outcomes 
The 2008 financial crisis threatened depression and mass unemployment, with the least well-off most 
exposed.   
Fiscal policy quickly came under severe strain as tax revenues plunged, the costs of social benefits rose 
sharply, and the huge bills for too-big-to-fail banks came due.  Since then sustained austerity has reduced 
the fiscal deficit from around 10% of GDP in 2010 to around 3 ½ % today.  While necessary, this has, on 
average, subtracted around 1 percentage from demand each year.  Over that time, structural policies have 
boosted participation in the labour market but have been unable to return productivity growth to anything 
resembling its historic average.  
For seven years, in the face of severe headwinds to growth, monetary policy has been the only game in 
town.   
Its task has been complicated by those historically low equilibrium interest rates.  These likely turned 
negative in the aftermath of the crisis, meaning that monetary policy has had to run very fast just to stand 
still.  Given constraints on how low nominal interest rates could go, the Bank of England’s MPC had to buy 
gilts – so-called Quantitative Easing (QE).  
What if the MPC had not acted? Simulations using the Bank’s main forecasting model suggest that the 
Bank’s monetary policy measures raised the level of GDP by around 8% relative to trend and lowered 
unemployment by 4 percentage points at their peak. Without this action, real wages would have been 8% 
lower, or around £2,000 per worker per year, and 1.5 million more people would have been out of work. In 
short, monetary policy has been highly effective.

Financial outcomes 
So monetary policy has been highly effective in doing its job, but what have been the distributional effects on 
financial outcomes? Has monetary policy robbed savers to pay borrowers? Has the MPC been Robin Hood 
in reverse?  In a word, no.

 That’s in part because, to a large extent, the thrifty saver and the rich asset holder are often one and the 
same. Just 2% of households have deposit holdings in excess of £5,000, few other financial assets, and 
don’t own a home.xxix So the vast majority of savers who might have lost some interest income from lower 
policy rates have stood to gain from increases in asset prices, particularly the recovery in house prices.  
Alternatively, have low interest rates meant the rich get richer at the expense of everyone else? Again, no. 
The data show that the poorest 20% of households have actually seen the largest proportional increases in 
their net wealth since 2006 (Chart 14), though a large part of this is due to a painful deleveraging (via lower 
mortgage debt).  The data do not support the idea that the period of low rates has benefitted the wealthiest 
at the expense of the least wealthy.  In actual fact, all wealth quintiles have experienced wealth increases.   
What about the distribution of income? Similar to wealth, and although labour income has been exceptionally 
weak, the total incomes of all groups have risen since 2006 (Chart 15). In fact, between 2006 and 2014, the 
bottom 20% saw the largest proportional gains, in spite of a devastating recession. Moreover, all groups 
have gained since 2009, when extraordinary monetary measures began to be implemented.

Monetary policy’s record  
In sum, the macro-financial record of the “only game in town” is clear.  It is not just that mass unemployment 
and debt deflation have been avoided. Since rates were cut to their (then) lowest possible levels and QE was 
launched, 2 ½ million jobs have been created, the proportion of people in work has moved to its highest level 
on record, nominal wages are up 17%, real GDP is up 15%, and the UK has consistently been one of the 
strongest economies in the G7. All major income groups have seen their income and wealth rise. 
Monetary policy has offset all of the headwinds to growth arising from private deleveraging, fiscal 
consolidation and subdued world growth (Chart 16).  People haven’t been made poorer; rather across major 
income and wealth categories, they are better off, and at the margin, surprisingly, income inequality has 
fallen a bit.1 
Why, then, doesn’t it feel like the good old days? Because anxiety about the future has increased, because 
productivity hasn’t recovered, and, as a consequence of the latter, because real wages are below where they 
were a decade ago – something that no-one alive today has experienced before. 
The underlying reasons for the 16% shortfall of the UK’s productive capacity, relative to trend, are poorly 
understood. 
What is clear is that the influence of monetary policy on productivity is limited. It can only stabilise demand 
around the economy’s potential; it cannot increase it.    
Boosting the determinants of long-run prosperity is the job of government’s structural, or supply-side policies. 
These government policies influence the economy’s investment in education and skills; its capacity for 
research and development; the quality of its core institutions, such as the rule of law; the effectiveness of its 
regulatory environment; the flexibility of its labour market; the intensity of competition; and its openness to 
trade and investment.  
The Chancellor’s recent Autumn Statement begins the process of rebalancing policies.  While fiscal 
prudence will continue, the degree of fiscal drag will be reduced somewhat, and major investments in the 
structural drivers of productivity including R&D and strategic infrastructure are planned.  
                                                      
1 To be clear, these improvements in financial distributions were not explicit objectives but; but welcome outcomes.

  VI. Building a Globalisation that Works for All 
To address the deeper causes of weak growth, higher inequality and rising insecurity requires a globalisation 
that works for all. 
For the societies of free-trading, networked countries to prosper, they must first re-distribute some of the 
gains from trade and technology, and then re-skill and reconnect all of their citizens. By doing so, they can 
put individuals back in control.  
For free trade to benefit all requires some redistribution. There are limits, of course, because of fiscal 
constraints at the macro level and the need to maintain incentives at the micro level. Fostering dependency 
on the state is no way to increase human agency, even though a safety net is needed to cushion shocks and 
smooth adjustment.  
Redistribution and fairness also means turning back the tide of stateless corporations.  As the Prime Minister 
recently stressed, companies must be rooted and pay tax somewhere: businesses operating across borders 
“have responsibilities … in terms, for example, of payment of tax.” They must recognise “the role that they 
play in local communities and the responsibilities that they have in any country they are operating in to abide 
by the rules.”

That is why the G20’s BEPS initiative, which will allow all countries to work together to implement measures 
against tax Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, is so important. And that is why the G20 might at least consider, 
as Larry Summers has suggested, a minimum tax on reported earnings to be paid somewhere.   
Because technology and trade are constantly evolving and can lead to rapid shifts in production, the 
commitment to reskilling all workers must be continual.   
In a job market subject to frequent, radical changes, people’s prospects depend on direct and creative 
engagement with global markets. Lifelong learning, ever-greening skills and cooperative training will become 
more important than ever.  
Finally, in an age where anyone can produce anything anywhere through 3-D printing, where anyone can 
broadcast their performance globally or sell to China whatever the size of their business, there is an 
opportunity for mass employment through mass creativity.   
Technology platforms such as taskrabbit, Alibaba, etsy, and Sama can help give smaller-scale producers 
and service providers a direct stake in global markets.  Smaller scale firms can by-pass big corporates and 
engage in a form of artisanal globalisation; a revolution that could bring cottage industry full circle. 
Indeed, why doesn’t the G20 pursue global free trade for Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs)?xxx  
Global free trade for SMEs, connected via such platforms, holds out the prospect of a more inclusive form of 
global commerce with the individual at its centre.    
VII. Conclusion: The Current Monetary Policy Outlook  
Allow me to conclude by touching on the current outlook for monetary policy.   
The MPC indicated in the spring that the impact of a vote to leave the EU on inflation would be the product of 
its impact on demand, supply and the exchange rate. And it stressed then that the implications for monetary 
policy would not be automatic. 
In August, the balance of these demand, supply, and exchange rate effects was consistent with the need for 
additional monetary policy stimulus. 
These measures are working. For those looking to borrow, credit is widely available. For those with debts, 
the cost is cheaper. Neither solely due nor totally unrelated to the actions the MPC took in August, growth 
appears to have been materially better than we had expected in the summer.  
Households appear to be looking through Brexit-related uncertainties at present. For them, signs of an 
economic slowdown are notable by their absence. Perceptions of job security remain strong. Wages are 
growing at around the same modest pace as at the start of the year. Credit is available and competitive. 
Confidence is solid.

In contrast to developments in the real economy, financial markets have taken a less sanguine view of Brexit 
prospects. Sterling is currently around 16% lower than its peak a year ago. Partly reflecting this depreciation, 
measures of inflation expectations have picked up notably.

 Ultimately, the tension between consumer strength on the one hand and the more pessimistic expectations 
of markets on the other will be resolved.  
In the MPC’s November projections, this resolution is expected to occur as imported inflation begins to weigh 
on people’s real incomes, slowing consumption growth. This moderation in household spending reinforces 
the cumulative effects of a pick-up in uncertainty on investment. As a consequence, growth is expected to 
remain below past averages for the next few years. 
One corroborating sign of this potential deceleration is that the UK expansion is increasingly consumption-led 
(Chart 17). The saving rate has fallen towards historic lows (Chart 18), and borrowing has resumed.  
Evidence from the past quarter century across a range of countries suggests episodes of consumption-led 
growth tends to be both slower and less durable.xxxi This is because consumption growth eventually 
outpaces earnings growth, increasing debt and making demand more sensitive to changes in employment 
and income.

The bigger picture is that more modest potential growth ultimately means lower real income growth. The only 
question is how this comes about: either through a compression of nominal wage growth and higher 
unemployment, or through faster growth in consumer prices and a smaller rise in joblessness. 
The MPC’s remit requires it to decide how to balance that trade-off, including the horizon over which it aims 
to return inflation to target. 
In the MPC’s judgement, attempting to offset fully the direct impact of sterling’s depreciation on CPI inflation 
with tighter monetary policy would be excessively costly in terms of foregone output and employment growth.  
For example, returning inflation to the 2% target in three years’ time would call for rates around 100 basis 
points higher over the next three years. Compared to the MPC’s November projections, that would increase 
unemployment by around 250,000 people. That higher unemployment would mean lower nominal wage 
growth, offsetting the effects of lower inflation on real wages. Either way, real wages would likely fall by 
around 4% compared to our expectations before the referendum. 
The MPC is choosing a period of somewhat higher consumer price inflation in exchange for a more modest 
increase in unemployment. There are limits, however, to the extent to which above-target inflation can be 
tolerated.  
Moreover, it remains the case that the outlook for inflation will depend on the evolution of the prospects for 
demand, supply and the exchange rate. Monetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes to the 
economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.   
Since early November, the sterling exchange rate is up around 6% and market interest rates in three years’ 
time are up around 30 basis points. Long-term interest rates are back to their pre-referendum levels. Markets 
also responded strongly to the US election result, with both breakeven inflation and real yields rising. 
Alongside those market developments, UK indicators suggest continued solid growth, and the pace of fiscal 
consolidation is now expected to be slower. The MPC will assess these and other developments at its 
meeting next week as it plots the monetary course ahead. 
Whatever economic developments and prospects, the MPC will always set monetary policy to maintain price 
stability and promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom. As it did when it was the only game in 
town after the global financial crisis; and as it will going forward, in better balance with fiscal and structural 
policies.  
Monetary policy will continue its good work as the UK economy adjusts to new opportunities with Europe and 
the rest of the world. 
In the end, monetary policy isn’t a spectre but a friendly ghost.

i Monetarism is the view that the dynamics of money have a temporary influence on demand and, via the celebrated “quantity equation”, 
a major influence of prices. Here I am using the term in a broader sense, to describe the view that monetary policy is the only tool 
necessary to stabilise the economy. Friedman advocated the control of money as superior to fiscal measures for stabilising the 
economy. In Friedman (1948) he argued that financing variations in the government deficit or surplus with monetary expansions or 
contractions would be stabilising. Later, in Friedman (1960), he advocated a constant growth rate of the money stock as a means to 
stabilise the economy effectively. Following the experiences of the 1980s, there is today great scepticism that the velocity of money 
circulation exhibits the kind of stability necessary to make the quantity equation operative as a means of inflation control, although 
money may still have useful information content as an indicator. As Gerry Bouey said, “We didn’t abandon the monetary aggregates, 
they abandoned us.” See Friedman, M. 1948. A monetary and fiscal framework for economic stability. American Economic Review 38, 
256–64; and Friedman, M. 1960. A Program for Monetary Stability. New York: Fordham University Press.

vii As my colleague Ben Broadbent has pointed out, this explains why rising real house prices did not result in large increases in the Gini

Gregory Clark has found a striking uniformity in rates of social mobility. See Clark, G. (2014), The Son Also Rises, Princeton University 
PRess. 
xii All of this matters. As formal studies of people’s happiness find, subjective well-being is significantly affected by perceptions of 
inequality and the sense of community. Moreover, psychologists have shown that the quest for higher wealth only provides short-term 
satisfaction and draws people into a pattern of consumption that never satiates. Individuals who put a higher premium on income have 
been shown to have lower subjective well-being and to be more prone to mental illness.  And research suggests that only those in the 
bottom quintile of the wealth distribution are notably happier when their wealth increases.  Even that effect only holds for the time it 
takes for people to adjust their expectations to their new circumstances. At the same time, those in the lowest quintile of wealth are 
found to be significantly more likely to report psychological distress compared to those in the highest quintile.  These findings are 
consistent with a broad school of psychological research that shows that feelings of control and opportunity are important determinants 
of mental health and happiness. The combination of these effects can mean that, even as GDP grows, if the gap between rich and poor 
widens, aggregate happiness can fall and mental health ailments rise.

xv In neoclassical models, free trade is Pareto Optimal in principle – in that the aggregate gains are sufficient to compensate those that 
lose out while preserving gains for the winners. This typically means some form of redistribution of the gains from trade is needed to 
achieve this outcome. This is the Kaldor-Hicks compensation principle. It is an open question, however, whether redistribution of this 
kind actually takes place in practice and, indeed, whether it is itself costless, as the Kaldor-Hicks principle assumes.

uncertainty”, NBER Working Paper No. 21633, October. Refers to 12-month trailing averages. 
xxi A range of factors can explain these trends including, recently, investors’ increasing aversion to disaster risk and desire to hold safe 
assets – like bonds – instead of risky ones – like equities. These other factors include the nature of the monetary policy regime, and the 
types of macroeconomic disturbance responsible for macroeconomic fluctuations. For example, commodity price shocks in the 1970s 
led to inflationary recessions, causing nominal bond prices to fall as inflation expectations rose, and equity prices to fall as the economy 
slowed. Improvements in the anti-inflation credibility of central banks, by contrast, reduced inflation risk premia in nominal bonds, raising 
their prices and lowering yields, while achieving such disinflation required temporary reductions in growth, lowering equity prices. 
Finally, demand shocks, which tend to create disinflationary recessions and inflationary upswings, tend also to generate negative  
co-movement between nominal bond prices and equity prices. See for example Campbell, J, Pflueger, C and Viceira, L (2015),

reduces the cyclical (i.e. business cycle) component of inequality in the pre-crisis period.  Both papers argue that the effects of monetary 
policy shocks are economically as well as statistically significant. However, other factors are much more important overall, as judged by 
the forecast error variance decompositions produced by the models in question.  Coibion, O., Gorodnichenko, Y., Kueng, L. and Silvia,
