Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices 
and Monetary Policy 
Speech at a Meeting Held by the Naigai Josei Chosa Kai 
(Research Institute of Japan) in Tokyo 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
It is my great honor to have the opportunity to address you today at the Naigai Josei Chosa 
Kai. 
 At the Monetary Policy  Meeting (MPM) held at the end of April, the Bank formulated its 
projections  for  Japan's  economic  activity  and  prices  as  well  as  risk  factors  through  fiscal 
2019, and released them in the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report). 
Today, I would like to talk about the Bank's outlook for Japan's economic activity and prices 
as well as its thinking behind the conduct of monetary policy, while outlining the Outlook 
Report. 
 I. Current Situation of Japan's Economic Activity and Its Outlook 
Stronger Global Economic Growth Momentum 
Let  me  start  by  talking  about  global  economic  developments.  In  the  first  half  of  2016, 
pessimistic  views  about  the  global  economy  prevailed  amid  turbulence  in  global  financial 
markets against the background of the slowdown in emerging economies and uncertainties 
regarding those economies. With the benefit of hindsight, however, it appears that the global 
economy  hit  bottom  in  the  first  half  of  2016.  Since  mid-2016,  the  global  economy  has 
continued  to  improve  steadily,  and  its  growth  momentum  now  seems  to  be  strengthening 
further.  In  particular,  a  global  improvement  in  the  manufacturing  sector  and  trade  activity 
has  become  clear.  For  example,  an  indicator  of  the  overall  business  conditions  in  the 
manufacturing sector has continued on an improving trend in advanced economies as well 
as emerging and commodity-exporting economies (Chart 1). In addition, with regard to the 
world trade volume  -- calculated by adding up imports in each country -- a pick-up in the 
trade volumes has been spreading globally, mainly for Asia and the United States (Chart 2). 
The world trade volume had tended to grow at a slower pace than world economic growth 
for  a  long  period  since  the  global  financial  crisis,  and  such  deceleration  in  growth  of  the 
world  trade  volume  is  called  "slow  trade."  As  regards  the  background  to  this,  structural 
factors such as a pause in the expansion of the global supply chain have been pointed out, in 
addition  to  a  cyclical  decline  in  demand.  The  recent  global  improvement  in  the 
manufacturing  sector  and  trade  activity  draws  attention  as  this  may  suggest  a  change  is 
finally taking place from such slow trade. 
 1 
The World Economic Outlook (WEO) released by the International  Monetary Fund (IMF) 
last  month  also  projects  that  the  global  economic  growth  rate  will  gradually  increase, 
registering 3.1 percent in 2016, 3.5 percent in 2017, and 3.6 percent in 2018. 
 Current Situation of Japan's Economic Activity 
Reflecting  such  improvement  in  the  global  economy,  the  economic  growth  in  Japan  has 
taken  hold  more  firmly.  While  the  Bank  had  previously  assessed  that  the  economy  had 
"continued  its  moderate  recovery  trend,"  the  assessment  was  revised  upward  in  the  April 
2017 Outlook Report, describing the economy  as "having been turning toward a moderate 
expansion."  This  is  based  on  the  fact  that,  with  the  virtuous  cycle  led  by  exports  and 
production  becoming  firmer,  the  output  gap  --  which  shows  the  utilization  of  capital  and 
labor and is defined such that its long-term average is 0 percent -- has turned positive (Chart 
3). 
 Let me elaborate on this point. In the corporate sector, exports and production have been on 
an  increasing  trend, mainly  on  the  back  of  the  cyclical  improvement in the  manufacturing 
sector on a global basis led by IT-related industries, as well as inventory and  capital stock 
adjustments  progressing  in  emerging  economies  (Chart  4).  In  this  situation,  corporate 
profits  have  been  improving  and  the  ratio  of  current  profits  to  sales  for  all  industries  and 
enterprises for the October-December quarter of 2016 marked record profits (Chart 5). The 
March 2017 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) suggested that 
business sentiment has improved in a wider range of industries. Under such circumstances, 
business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend. 
 Improvements  also  have  been  observed  in  the  household  sector.  The  employment  and 
income  situation  has  continued  to  improve  steadily.  The  active  job  openings-to-applicants 
ratio is almost comparable to the peak level observed during the "asset bubble" period, with 
the  latest  figure  being  1.45  times,  and  a  perception  of  labor  shortage  suggested  by  the 
diffusion index (DI) for employment conditions in the March Tankan has heightened further 
(Chart  6).  The  unemployment  rate  has  declined  to  the  range  of  2.5-3.0  percent  recently, 
which  is  virtually  full  employment.  Under  such  tightening  of  labor  market  conditions, 
wages have been rising moderately (Chart 7). In particular, the year-on-year rate of increase 
 2 
in  hourly  cash  earnings  of  part-time  employees,  which  are  responsive  to  labor  market 
conditions,  has  accelerated,  being  at  around  2  percent  of  late.  As  for  scheduled  cash 
earnings  of  full-time  employees,  many  firms  are  expected  to  raise  their  base  pay  for  the 
fourth consecutive year in the annual spring labor-management wage negotiations this year. 
Base  pay  rises  are  especially  evident  this  year  in  small  and  medium-sized  firms  that  face 
higher  labor  shortages.  Against  the  background  of  such  improvement  in  the  employment 
and  income  situation,  private  consumption  has  been  resilient.  Although  relatively  weak 
developments had been seen in some of its indicators in the first half of 2016, it has picked 
up  thereafter,  due  mainly  to  an  improvement  in  consumer  sentiment.  The  Consumption 
Activity  Index  (CAI)  --  which  the  Bank  calculates  by  combining  various  sales  and 
supply-side  statistics  --  has  followed  a  moderate  increasing  trend  since  the  second  half  of 
2016 (Chart 8). 
 Outlook for Japan's Economic Activity 
With  regard  to  the  outlook,  Japan's  economy  is  likely  to  continue  its  moderate expansion. 
Specifically, with the growth rates in overseas economies increasing moderately, a virtuous 
cycle  from  income  to  spending  is  likely  to  be  maintained  in  both  the  corporate  and 
household  sectors,  on  the  back  of  highly  accommodative  financial  conditions  and  fiscal 
spending 
through 
the  government's 
large-scale  stimulus  measures.  Under  such 
circumstances, the economy is likely to continue expanding and maintain growth at a pace 
above its potential, mainly through fiscal 2018. At present, Japan's potential growth rate as 
estimated  by  the  Bank is in  the  range  of  0.5-1.0  percent; the  medians  of  the Policy  Board 
members' forecasts  of  the  growth  rates  for  fiscal  2017  and  2018  were  1.6  percent  and  1.3 
percent,  respectively  (Chart  9).  These  projections  are  more  or  less  unchanged  from  those 
presented in the January 2017 Outlook Report. 
 In fiscal 2019, for which the outlook was newly formulated in the latest Outlook Report, the 
growth  pace  is  projected  to  decelerate,  although  the  economy  is  expected  to  continue 
expanding. The first reason for the forecast concerns cyclical adjustments  in capital stock. 
That is, the current economic expansion phase has been continuing since end-2012, and it 
would have lasted for a considerably long period by fiscal 2019. Considering the business 
cycle, therefore, business fixed investment in particular is likely to decelerate. Furthermore, 
 3 
peaking  out  of  the  Olympic  Games-related  demand  would  also  exert  an  impact  on  the 
cyclical adjustments. The second reason is the scheduled consumption tax hike. In the April 
2017 Outlook Report, economic projections were formulated based on the assumption that 
the consumption tax will be raised to 10 percent in October 2019 pursuant to the provisions 
of  the  law.  The  scheduled  consumption  tax  hike  will  affect  the  growth  rates  through  the 
following  two  channels:  (1)  the  front-loaded  increase  and  subsequent  decline  in  demand 
prior to and after the consumption tax hike and (2) the effects of a decline in real income. 
The  negative  impact  of  the  consumption  tax  hike  on  the  projected  growth  rate  for  fiscal 
2019 is expected to be smaller than that on the rate for fiscal 2014, when the last tax hike 
took place, mainly because the increase in the consumption tax rate is smaller than that of 
the  previous  tax  hike  and  a  reduced  tax  rate  will  be  applied  to  such  items  as  food  and 
beverages.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  impact  of  the  consumption  tax  hike  is 
highly  uncertain  and  varies  depending,  for  example,  on  the  income  situation  and  price 
developments.  The  impact  of  the  next  tax  hike  in  particular  should  be  regarded  as  being 
subject to a considerable margin of error because  it is scheduled to take place as far  off as 
two and a half years from now. 
 II. Current Situation of Prices and Their Outlook 
Current Situation of Prices 
Next, I will talk about price developments. Since the second half of 2014, the year-on-year 
rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) excluding fresh food had remained under 
downward  pressure  stemming  from  the  decline  in  crude  oil  prices;  however,  with  energy 
prices  now  starting  to  exert  upward  pressure  on  general  prices,  the  rate  of  change  turned 
positive  in  January  2017  for  the  first  time  in  13  months.  Meanwhile,  looking  at  the 
year-on-year rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh food and energy, while this had been 
in negative territory before the introduction of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing 
(QQE) in April 2013, it turned positive in autumn 2013. Thereafter, the rate of change has 
been positive as a trend for more than three years (Chart 10). Japan's economy is no longer 
in deflation, which is commonly defined as a sustained decline in prices. 
 Nevertheless, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI excluding fresh food and energy 
had remained on a decelerating trend following the peak of 1.3 percent in November 2015; 
 4 
thereafter, the rate of change has been fluctuating. Some weakness in the CPI observed last 
year  appears  to  have  been  affected  by  firms'  cautious  price-setting  stance  against  the 
background of relatively  weak  private consumption  and by the appreciation of the  yen.  In 
recent  months,  the  reduction  in  prices  of  and  charges  for  mobile  phones  has  exerted  a 
considerable impact on the CPI. Such temporary developments in specific sectors should be 
considered separately from the underlying trend in inflation. However, looking at the CPI as 
a whole, it is also true that the inflation momentum is not yet sufficiently firm. Meanwhile, 
inflation expectations also have remained in a weakening phase. Various market indicators 
and survey results indicate that inflation expectations have not yet picked up clearly on the 
whole, although some of them show a rise in such expectations. 
 Momentum toward Achieving the Price Stability Target of 2 Percent 
As I have explained, there is some contrast observed between recent economic activity and 
prices,  in that the  real  economy  has  been  improving  steadily,  whereas  price  developments 
have remained sluggish thus far. However, we believe that the momentum toward achieving 
the price stability target of 2 percent has been maintained firmly and the year-on-year rate of 
change in the CPI excluding fresh food is likely to increase toward 2 percent. 
 Specifically,  we expect the following mechanism  for higher inflation going forward.  First, 
further  improvement  in  the  output  gap,  mainly  on  the  back  of  further  tightening  of  labor 
market conditions,  will lead to  a rise in the inflation rate through wage increases. Second, 
energy  prices  will  push  up  the  CPI  and  their  contribution  to  it  will  increase  through  the 
second  half  of  2017.  Third,  with  these  factors  pushing  up  actual  inflation  rates,  inflation 
expectations are expected to rise accordingly, leading to an increase in the underlying trend 
in inflation. Let me elaborate on this mechanism. 
 Recently, more firms are taking initiatives to improve working conditions, including wages, 
in  order  to  address  increased  demand  and  labor  shortage.  Looking  at  historical 
developments,  there  has  been  a  stable  relationship  observed  between  the  CPI  and  hourly 
nominal  wages  in  Japan,  where  their  rates  of  increase  move  almost  in  parallel.  In  fact, 
prices  of  goods  and  services  have  been  increasing  steadily.  The  Bank  aims  at  a  moderate 
rise  in  the  CPI  inflation  accompanied  by  a  rise  in  corporate  profits  and  wages,  and  these 
 5 
developments are exactly  what we expect. However, it is also true that wage increases are 
relatively moderate despite the tightening of labor market conditions and a rise in corporate 
profits. One of the reasons behind this is that, after having experienced protracted deflation, 
the  mindset and  behavior  based  on  the  assumption  that  prices  will not  increase  have  been 
deeply entrenched among the public. For instance, in the annual spring labor-management 
wage negotiations, a base pay rise is  usually negotiated based on the previous fiscal year's 
inflation  rate.  Some  firms  have  started  to  cut  back  their  services  in  response  to  a  rise  in 
labor costs in real terms due to wage increases and a reduction in hours worked, instead of 
raising  prices  of  their  goods  and  services.  This  is  another  example  of  the  persistent 
deflationary  mindset.  It  is  not  easy  to  dispel  this  mindset.  That  said,  the  environment 
surrounding wages and inflation has been improving steadily, albeit at a moderate pace. It is 
important to ensure that this positive trend continues going forward. 
 Medium-  to  long-term  inflation  expectations  --  that  is,  people's  perception  of  future  price 
developments  --  are  a  crucial  factor  that  determines  the  inflation  rate  from  a  relatively 
long-term perspective. As pointed out in the Bank's Comprehensive Assessment released in 
September  2016,  inflation  expectations  going  forward  in  Japan  tend  to  be  largely  affected 
by  actual  inflation  rates.  This  tendency  is  described  as  the  inflation  expectation  formation 
being  largely  "adaptive,"  in  somewhat  technical  terms.  Since  summer  2015,  inflation 
expectations have been in a weakening phase, and this is mainly attributable to the fact that 
actual inflation rates had declined against the backdrop of a fall in crude oil prices and the 
headwinds  for  the  global  economy,  which  I  mentioned  at  the  outset.  However,  going 
forward,  this  mechanism  is  expected  to  work  in  the  opposite  direction.  That  is,  if  actual 
inflation rates rise on the back of increases in wages and energy prices, this rise will lead to 
an  increase  in  inflation  expectations,  through  the  adaptive  mechanism.  The  Bank  aims  to 
eventually achieve a situation where people's inflation expectations are firmly anchored at 2 
percent even if actual inflation rates fluctuate due to various factors. In order to achieve that 
situation, however, actual inflation rates need to be raised first. While an increase in the CPI 
due to energy prices is transitory, this rise will work as a driving force for raising inflation 
expectations. 
  6 
Against  this  background,  the  medians  of  the  Policy  Board  members'  forecasts  of  the 
year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) presented in the April 2017 
Outlook Report are 1.4 percent for fiscal 2017, 1.7 percent for fiscal 2018, and, on a basis 
excluding  the  direct  effects  of  the  scheduled  consumption  tax  hike,  1.9  percent  for  fiscal 
2019  (Chart  9).  The  forecasts  through  fiscal  2018  are  more  or  less  unchanged  from  those 
presented  in  the  January  Outlook  Report.  The  timing  of  the  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI 
reaching around 2 percent will likely be around fiscal 2018, which also is unchanged from 
the  previous  Outlook  Report.  In  fiscal  2019,  the  rate  of  change  is  expected  to  remain  at 
around 2 percent as inflation expectations rise. 
 III. Risk Factors for Economic Activity and Prices Going Forward 
There  are  upside  and  downside  risk  factors  to  the  baseline  scenario  for  economic  activity 
and  prices  that  I  have  explained  thus  far.  Next,  I  would  like  to  talk  about  the  major  risk 
factors. 
 The largest risk factor for economic activity is developments in overseas economies.  While 
it  is  true  that  the  global  economic  growth  momentum  has  been  increasing,  uncertainties 
regarding future developments have remained high. 
 In  particular,  the  U.S.  economic  policies  and  their  impact  on  global  financial  markets 
warrant  attention.  The  U.S.  government  has  released  the  tax  reform  plan  recently;  it  is 
necessary to carefully monitor how the specifics of its economic policies as a whole and its 
initiatives toward implementing these policies will play out. With regard to developments in 
the  financial  markets,  stock  prices  and  the  long-term  interest  rate  have  risen  significantly 
since last autumn on the back of expectations for the new administration's aggressive policy 
conduct.  In  the  meantime,  there  was  a  phase  where  they  declined  somewhat  amid 
uncertainties regarding its economic policies. Since the U.S. economic policies can largely 
affect  not  only  its  economy  but  also  the  global  economy  and  financial  markets,  the  new 
administration's policy direction and its effects warrant careful attention. 
 In  Europe,  there  are  noticeable  risk  factors  such  as  (1)  national  elections  scheduled  to  be 
held  in  some  major  economies,  in  addition  to  the  presidential  election  held  recently  in 
 7 
France, (2) negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU) and 
their effects, and (3) prospects regarding the European debt problem, including the financial 
sector. In addition, developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies as well 
as various geopolitical risks are uncertain. It is therefore necessary to continue to pay close 
attention to the possibility that these risk factors will affect the economy through  volatility 
in  global  financial  markets  and  possible  deteriorations  in  people's  sentiment.  On  the  other 
hand,  we  also  should  keep  in  mind  that,  given  that  market  participants  and  economic 
entities already factor these risks in to a certain extent, the economy could deviate upward 
from the baseline scenario through a rise in sentiment depending on how they play out. 
 In addition to the risks mentioned earlier, developments in firms' and households' medium- 
to  long-term  inflation  expectations  warrant  due  attention  as  they  would  directly  affect 
inflation going forward. While we expect that inflation expectations are likely to follow an 
increasing  trend,  given  that  actual  inflation  rates  have  been  somewhat  weak  recently, 
uncertainty remains regarding the momentum to push up inflation expectations through the 
"adaptive  expectation  formation  mechanism."  In  the  baseline  scenario,  firms'  price-  and 
wage-setting stance is expected to become more positive as inflation expectations increase. 
However,  it  should  be  noted  that  their  price-  and  wage-setting  stance  could  remain  more 
cautious than the baseline scenario, depending on developments in inflation expectations. 
 IV. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy 
Lastly,  I  would  like  to  touch  upon  the  thinking  behind  the  Bank's  conduct  of  monetary 
policy. In September 2016, the Bank introduced "QQE with Yield Curve Control"  -- a new 
framework  for  monetary  easing  --  and  thereby  strengthened  the  two  previous  policy 
frameworks  of  QQE  and  "QQE  with  a  Negative  Interest  Rate."  This  new  framework 
consists of two components (Chart 11). 
 The  first  is  an  inflation-overshooting  commitment.  This  is  a  strong  commitment  that  the 
Bank will continue expanding the monetary base until the  year-on-year rate of increase in 
the  actual  CPI  exceeds  2  percent  and  stays  above  that  level  in  a  stable  manner.  As  I 
explained earlier, taking into account that inflation expectation formation is largely adaptive 
in  Japan,  it  is  crucial  that  the  public  actually  experience  inflation  above  2  percent  and 
 8 
thereby the perception takes hold among them that prices of goods and services tend to go 
up every year by around 2 percent. With this in mind, the Bank committed itself to continue 
with  large-scale  monetary  expansion  until  such  situation  is  achieved  through  this  unique 
inflation-overshooting commitment. 
 The  second  component  is  yield  curve  control.  This  aims  to  seek  a  decline  in  real  interest 
rates,  which  has  been  the  main  transmission  mechanism  of  policy  effects  since  the 
introduction of QQE, by  controlling short- and long-term interest rates. Under  yield curve 
control,  the  Bank  has  been  facilitating  the  formation  of  the  yield  curve  that  is  considered 
most appropriate for maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target 
of  2  percent,  taking  account  of  developments  in  economic  activity  and  prices  as  well  as 
financial  conditions.  At  present,  in  the  guideline  for  market  operations,  the  Bank  sets  the 
short-term  policy  interest  rate  at  minus  0.1  percent  and  the  target  level  of  the  10-year 
Japanese government bond (JGB) yields at around 0 percent, conducting JGB purchases so 
as to achieve this target level. 
 Almost  eight  months  have  passed  since  the  Bank  introduced  "QQE  with  Yield  Curve 
Control."  Under  this  framework,  the  yield  curve  has  been  formed  smoothly  in  a  manner 
consistent  with  the  guideline  for  market  operations.  Against  this  background,  financial 
conditions  have  been  highly  accommodative.  The  year-on-year  rate  of  increase  in  the 
amount outstanding of bank lending has been accelerating to around 3 percent recently, on 
the back of increases in demand for funds related to mergers and acquisitions and in those 
for business fixed investment. As this indicates, the monetary easing effects have prevailed 
steadily. 
 As I explained earlier, although the economic growth in Japan has taken hold more firmly, 
there  is  still  a  long  way  to  go  to  achieve  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent,  and  the 
inflation momentum is not yet sufficiently firm. Risks have continued to be skewed to the 
downside,  particularly  those  regarding  developments  in  overseas  economies  and  in  firms' 
and households' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Under these circumstances, I 
believe  it  is  of  utmost importance that the Bank  maintain  the  current  guideline  for  market 
operations and persistently pursue powerful monetary easing. 
 9 
Meanwhile, as I have stated repeatedly, the Bank's JGB purchases are conducted to achieve 
the target level of interest rates specified by the guideline for market operations decided at 
each MPM. The actual conduct of JGB purchases is, in that regard, determined practically. 
As  a  result,  such  factors  as  the  amount  of  JGB  purchases  at  each  individual  auction  may 
vary  depending  on  financial  market  conditions.  However,  this  has  no  implications  for 
monetary policy going forward. 
 With  regard  to  the  future  conduct  of  monetary  policy,  the  Bank  decides  the  guideline  for 
market operations at each MPM with a view to facilitating the formation of the yield curve 
that is deemed most appropriate for maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price 
stability target of 2 percent, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices 
as  well  as  financial  conditions.  In  this  regard,  as  the  global  interest  rate  environment  is 
changing  in  response  to  the  pick-up  in  global  growth  momentum and the  Federal  Reserve 
proceeding with the policy rate hikes, some argue that the Bank should take these changes 
into  account  in  conducting  its  monetary  policy.  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  each 
central bank pursues monetary policy with the aim of achieving their domestic mandate of 
supporting  economic  activity  and  ensuring  price  stability.  Since  the  conduct  of  monetary 
policy depends on their own economic and price developments, it is natural that there is a 
divergence  in  their  policy  directions  reflecting  differences  in  the  underlying  economic 
conditions  and  inflation.  The  Bank  will  continue  to  conduct  monetary  policy  in  an 
appropriate  manner,  taking  into  account  domestic  economic  and  price  developments,  in 
order to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time. 
 Conclusion 
Four  years  have  passed  since  the  Bank  introduced  QQE  in  April  2013.  In  the  meantime, 
Japan's  economic  activity  and  prices  have  improved  significantly.  Although  it  is  taking  a 
long time to change the deflationary mindset that has been entrenched among the public for 
many years, the situation is improving steadily toward achieving the price stability target of 
2 percent. What is of utmost importance is to continue with monetary easing until the Bank 
achieves  the  2  percent  target.  The  current  policy  framework  --  "QQE  with  Yield  Curve 
Control"  --  is  a  highly  sustainable  framework  that  is  designed  to  enable  the  Bank  to  take 
flexible  responses  to  address  various  changes  in  the  situation.  The  Bank  will  achieve  the 
 10 
price stability target of 2 percent by persistently pursuing powerful monetary easing under 
this framework. 
 Thank you.
