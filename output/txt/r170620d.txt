            Introduction 
Mr. Governor of the Senate’s Finance Committee, Senator Carlos Montes, honorable  
members of this Committee, ladies, gentlemen, 
Thank you for your invitation to present the views of the Board of the Central Bank of 
Chile about the recent macroeconomic developments, their projections and implications 
for monetary policy. This vision is contained in detail in our Monetary Policy Report (the 
Report) of March 2017. It is worth mentioning that this Report includes for the first time 
economic forecasts for 2018, as I will show you throughout this presentation. 
I am here with the full Board and all the staff responsible for the topics covered in our 
Report. I wish to make a special mention of our new Board member, Ms Rosanna Costa, 
recently  confirmed  by  this  Senate,  and  Ms  Solange  Berstein,  our  Financial  Policy 
Division Director, as of today.  
In recent months, annual CPI inflation has continued to decline, in line with forecasts in 
the December Report. Goods inflation continues to be shaped largely by the movements 
of the exchange rate, while services inflation has continued to drop gradually, marked by 
the widespread indexation and consistently with the business cycle.  
Meanwhile,  in  late  last  year  and  into  this,  GDP  of  non-natural-resources  sectors 
performed  weaker than  forecast. Furthermore, incoming data suggest that it will take 
longer than expected to recover. This, coupled with recent events that have considerably 
eroded mining activity, will pull down annual GDP growth in 2017.  
However, as can be seen in the outlook I will be sharing with you in a few moments, a 
number of elements will help the economy to regain momentum within the projection 
horizon. Worth noting among these are that no significant macroeconomic imbalances 
are  observed,  that  the  negative  impact  of  the  mining  investment  adjustment  has 
diminished, that the external scenario has improved, and that monetary policy will remain 
clearly  expansionary.  Overall,  capacity  gaps  foreseen  for  the  next  two  years  will  be 
somewhat wider than we thought in December, toning down medium-term inflationary 
pressures.  
In this context, the Board lowered the monetary policy interest rate (MPR) by 50 basis 
points during the early months of the year, speeding up the cuts with respect to provisions 
made in December. At the same time, we considered that, to ensure the convergence of 
inflation to the target, it will be necessary to enhance the monetary impulse somewhat, 
which reflects in an MPR trajectory similar to the one implied by financial asset prices 
during the ten days prior to the statistical closing of this Report. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
In  February,  annual  CPI  inflation  was  2.7%,  while  core  inflation—CPIEFE;  CPI 
excluding  energy  and  foodstuffs—was  2.2%,  driven  mainly  by  its  goods  component, 
whose annual growth fell to 0.4% in February, in line with the nominal exchange rate, 
which is now below its year-ago level. The services component of the CPIEFE posted an 
annual  change  of  3.4%  in  February,  a  quite  milder  fall  than  its  goods  component, 
reflecting its greater inertia (figure 1). About this, it is worth noting that one feature of 
the CPI services basket is that 75% of its prices are either managed or linked to another 
indicator  or  to  past  inflation,  meaning  that  they  are  indexed.  This  fact  in  practice 
augments their inertia and causes the effect of any change in the activity gap to take 
longer to show up. Of course, this is not the case for every service price, as non-indexed 
or non-managed prices tend to show a more visible effect from changes in the gap. One 
of the boxes in the Report is devoted to this, showing how the differences in the recent 
evolution of services inflation appear when these recently mentioned price groups are 
taken separately. 
In  this  Report’s  baseline  scenario  we  foresee  that  headline  inflation  will  continue  to 
decline for some months, to return to 3% by year’s end and hover around that mark until 
the first quarter of 2019, when the current projection horizon ends. The CPIEFE will 
decline steadily until the second half of 2017 and will take longer to hit 3% (figure 2).  
This inflation path relies on two assumptions: first, a fairly  stable  real  exchange rate 
around its current levels, which are estimated to be in line with fundamentals; second, 
that  although  the  output  gap  will  exceed  the  December  estimate  for  some  time,  it  is 
projected that, for the aforesaid reasons, it will begin to close towards the end of this year. 
Activity growth ended 2016 in line with the December forecast, although characterized 
by a steeper slowdown during the year, which is expected to continue well into 2017. On 
20  March,  the  Bank  published  the  first  National  Accounts  figures  based  on  the  new 
benchmark compilation that uses the base year 2013. This change is intended to update 
the way the evolution of the national economy is gauged, incorporating new estimation 
methodologies, changes in international standards and new sources of information. The 
Bank  makes  these  changes  regularly  every  five  years,  according  to  the  respective 
international  standards  set  by  the  IMF  and  the  OECD.  The  most  salient  changes  are 
depicted in a box in this Report, and all the details can be seen in several documents 
uploaded on our website.  
The new data, which included a very small revision to 2014 and 2015 growth, confirmed 
the further weakening of the economy in the last quarter of the year, and at the same time 
modified the growth trajectories of the already published quarters of 2016. In particular, 
the economy would have slightly outperformed previous estimates for the first part of 
that year. By sectors, it confirmed that Mining posted negative y-o-y growth throughout 
the whole year, while activity in areas unrelated to natural resources (i.e. Other GDP) 
continued to worsen, going from growing 3% in the first quarter to 1% in the fourth 
(figure 3). In the other sectors, most weak in the fourth quarter were particularly those 
sectors linked to investment in construction and related services, which are usually more 
persistent. Also personal services decelerated, although it is estimated that it responded 
partly to the effects of the public sector strike at the end of last year (figure 4).  
On  the  domestic  expenditure  side,  y-o-y  growth  in  final  demand—minus  inventory 
change—also  showed  a  downsloping  trend  throughout  the  year.  The  biggest  loss  of 
 
2 
      dynamism was seen in investment in construction and other works, whose annual rate of 
change  was  -4.9%  in  the  fourth  quarter  (0.5%  average  between  the  first  and  third 
quarters). Private consumption, as has been the case for some years, provided support to 
the economy, growing by over 2% annually throughout 2016. This was helped by growth 
in labor income, falling inflation and persistent low unemployment by historic standards. 
It is worth noting that while growth in non-durable consumption has remained stable, 
durable consumption growth has recovered, partly due to the appreciation of the peso in 
the last year and partly due to the necessary replenishment of stocks after several years 
of low or even negative expansion. Something similar is observed in gross fixed capital 
formation in machinery and equipment. Discounting unusual purchases of transportation 
equipment,  this  investment  component  has  tended  to  perform  better  in  the  past  few 
months (figure 5). 
The labor market has continued to adjust. Salaried employment stands out with a fall of 
2.1% annually in the December to February moving quarter, as does the moderation of 
annual wage growth. Plus the reduction in hours worked,  at a time where a growing 
number  of  workers  claim  that  they  work  fewer  hours  than  desired.  Anyway,  self- 
employment, while more precarious, has significantly cushioned the disturbances coming 
from salaried employment (figure 6). 
A constant concern in recent years has originated in the evolution of the labor market. In 
several Reports we have included boxes and research notes addressing various related 
topics, including the degree of working flexibility and how changes in labor conditions 
affect  unemployment.  Our  last  issue  includes  a  box  that  explores  the  effects  of  the 
business cycle on workers' wages. Normally, wages are analyzed using aggregate data 
that, by their very nature, conceal the movements of individual wages. Using data per 
worker, we show that the dynamics of individual wages are much more correlated with 
the business cycle than what aggregate wages would suggest. In particular, because the 
wages of workers changing jobs—either voluntarily or involuntarily—are affected, for 
better or for worse, depending if the business cycle is favorable or not. This is a line of 
ongoing research that allows us to better understand the evolution of the labor market and 
its implications for medium-term inflationary pressures. 
Domestic  financial  conditions,  meanwhile,  are  still  good  in  terms  of  interest  rates. 
However,  lending  volumes  have  slowed  compared  to  previous  years,  which  the 
respondents to the Bank’s Business Perceptions Report and Bank Credit Survey interpret 
as the consequence of weak demand (figure 7). 
In our baseline scenario, we estimate that this year the economy will grow between 1% 
and 2%, down from the range we projected in December, 1.5% to 2.5%. Around 0.2 
percentage  points  of  this  correction  originate  in  the  effects  of  the  Escondida  mine 
downtime. Because of the importance of this mine in the country’s copper production—
15% to 20% in 2016—, this downtime will have a substantial impact on first-quarter 
GDP, around 1 percentage point of reduced growth, taking the figure to near zero. 
Despite its economic impact, the Escondida deadlock, plus the effects of massive forest 
fires in January and February, are all one-time events that not only do not affect the long-
 
3 
      term trajectory, but neither do they influence the dynamic of the business cycle. Thus, we 
do not expect these events to have any material repercussion on the performance of other 
economic sectors or on inflation. In the case of mining production, although its impact 
on GDP of the first quarter is significant as it is determined mostly by supply-side factors, 
it is deleted from the Other GDP calculation that the Bank uses in its models to measure 
the activity gap and the medium-term inflation outlook. 
Thus, the change in the projected range for 2017—of half of one percentage point—
responds to two major factors. On the one hand, about half is explained by Escondida 
mining downtime and other incidents during the first quarter. On the other hand, the 
greater  weakness  we  saw  in  the  course  of  2016  gives  a  lower  starting  point  for  the 
economy this year. In particular, because this weakness has been observed in sectors that 
tend to be more persistent in their dynamics, such as construction and associated areas. 
We must not forget that this sector received a significant boost in 2015, which lasted into 
early 2016, as a result of the new VAT that would be charged to the sector under the tax 
reform. Such reduced strength responds largely to the end of this boost. There is also the 
effect that the lending standards of mortgage loans have tightened too, given the higher 
down payment demanded by the banks. Another important issue worth looking into are 
the changes in inventories over recent years. The year 2016 completed three years of 
inventory depletion, which is quite uncommon. In general, inventory movements reflect 
how companies predict the future: if they are optimistic about it, they accumulate, and 
vice-versa.  Recent  years’  relentless  downward  revisions  to  growth  prospects  have 
permeated companies’ desired level of inventories and part of what we see in the 2017 
growth outlook is also related to that.  
For 2018, the baseline scenario assumes that the economy will perform better than this 
year, growing in the 2.25% to 3.25% range. This will allow the activity gap to narrow 
steadily  throughout  next  year,  keeping  in  mind  that  the  Board  still  estimates  our 
economy’s potential growth rate between 2.5% and 3%, and trend growth at 3.2%. 
These projections assume that, after a three-year-long fall, gross fixed capital formation 
(GFCF) will post a slightly positive growth in 2017 and a clearly stronger expansion in 
2018. This result will be decisively influenced by higher investment in non-mining and 
non-housing investment (mainly machinery and equipment). This, because the former is 
expected to regain its positive numbers during 2018 and the latter to continue to adjust 
for  a  few  more  quarters,  after  the  boom  triggered  by  amendments  to  VAT  payment 
regulations in the sector. As a percentage of GDP, in 2017 GFCF will reach 21.7% and 
22.5% in real and nominal terms, respectively.  
On the consumption side, no major  changes  are expected in annual growth, and it is 
foreseen that it will continue to sustain domestic output and expenditure. Our baseline 
scenario assumes that consumption will grow at a pace of 2.5% and 3% this and next 
year, quite like 2016. It also assumes that export volume will grow a little over 1.5% this 
year,  and  the  rate  will  double  in  2018.  Behind  this  increase  is  an  improved  external 
scenario, which I will discuss in a moment. In this context, the current account deficit 
will be smaller than projected in December, and 2017 will be better than 2016, due to 
slower growth in domestic demand and improved terms of trade (table 1). 
 
4 
          As I said earlier, the greater growth expected in 2018 originates in the economy having 
no major imbalances, the end of some factors that have hindered growth in recent years—
for  example,  the  four-year  plunge  of  mining  investment—an  expansionary  monetary 
policy stance and a stronger impulse from abroad compared with previous years. As for 
fiscal policy, it is assumed that the consolidation announced by the Administration will 
proceed further. 
The recovery that reflects in the annual figures projected for 2018 should begin during 
the  course  of  this  year,  considering  the  negative  impact  of  the  debilitated  economic 
activity at the end of 2016 and early 2017. In fact, the average annual GDP growth of the 
last quarter of 2016 and the first of this year is somewhat above 0%. Already for the 
second  quarter,  in  our  baseline  scenario,  it  will  rise  above  1.5%  annually,  which,  on 
average, will be sustained and increased in the second half of the year. However, as we 
will see later, this scenario relies partly on a stronger monetary policy bias, which is 
necessary for the inflation target to be met. 
Internationally, in the last few months a somewhat more favorable scenario has been 
forming. On the one hand, activity and expectations indicators in the developed world 
have revealed a better economic environment. Particularly noteworthy is the situation of 
the manufacturing sector, which after long years of stagnation shows improved results 
and prospects, which has been added to the greater dynamism of services sectors that has 
been observed for several quarters (figure 8). In the United States, persistent positive 
consumption figures—sustained by a robust labor market— have coupled with the much 
desired  rebound  in  investment.  In  the  Eurozone,  the  stronger  and  more  synchronized 
recovery among its members stands out. In Japan, the depreciation of the yen has given 
a  boost  to  the  foreign  sector.  Thus,  relative  to  the  December  forecast,  the  growth 
projection for 2017 of our trading partners in the developed world is revised upward by 
2 decimals, to 1.8%, this year and next. 
Improved conditions in the developed world have given way to expectations pointing to 
a normalization of inflation or have at least dissipated the risk of deflation that existed 
not long ago. Thus, the Federal Reserve continued normalizing of its monetary policy 
and policy makers in Europe and Japan have ruled out further QE. Markets have gradually 
incorporated these changes in their expectations avoiding major disruptions (figure 9). In 
the past, the processes of raising interest rates in the US were surrounded by complex 
economic and financial developments in some economies. In the 1980s, the most critical 
case, there was the debt crisis in Latin America. Then in the 1990s, the most significant 
effects were circumscribed to some countries. In the 2000s, the emerging world was not 
so affected directly, but the subsequent subprime crisis in the United States and all its 
implications for the world resulted the Federal Reserve rate hike. Today, the conditions 
in which the United States and the emerging world confront the episode are different as 
seen from both sides. China's growth and the size of Europe make them a potential risk 
for the Fed, so it cannot overlook the effect of its decisions on these economies. At the 
same time, economic policy frameworks have changed in emerging markets and are more 
capable of dealing with external shocks. Anyway, it is still an element of risk. A box in 
this Report provides a deeper analysis of these topics. 
 
5 
      Beyond the volatility of recent months, the dollar remains strong with respect to most 
currencies, developed and emerging. Our peso, which has depreciated a little more than 
30%  from  its  2013  average,  has  behaved  similarly  to  most  of  our  trading  partners’ 
currencies,  so  its  multilateral  variation  has  been  much  smaller.  Accordingly,  the  real 
exchange rate index with base year 1986=100 is now near 93, some 3% above its 2013 
average (figure 10). 
Among emerging economies, the improvement in China’s outlook is worth noting. In the 
fourth quarter of last year, the Chinese GDP grew 6.8%, so growth for the full year was 
6.7%.  Conjunctural  numbers  and  financial  indicators  have  been  calmer,  according  to 
manufacturing output and foreign trade figures. The renminbi is depreciating gradually 
and the large capital outflows and reserves depletion of 2016 have stopped. Meanwhile, 
the authorities set the growth objective at 6.5%. Thus, our baseline scenario has revised 
the Chinese growth forecast upward by 2 decimals.  
In  Latin  America,  the  main  economies  in  the  region  are  still  adjusting.  In  Brazil, 
consumption  and  investment  are  weak,  as  is  manufacturing  production  in  Colombia. 
Argentina is also undergoing a difficult process and, although more lagging than in other 
countries,  has  shown  signs  of  milder  deterioration  of  activity,  especially  concerning 
manufacturing  output.  The  Mexican  economy  could  sustain  good  growth  and 
performance in the labor market until the markets became aware of the potential effects 
of the US elections on trade and migration. This has resulted in weak investment. In this 
context,  the  Mexican  authorities  have  taken  steps  to  strengthen  their  macroeconomic 
fundamentals, through policies aimed at consolidating public finances, withdrawing the 
monetary stimulus to deal with inflationary pressures, and managing the exchange rate to 
counteract the sharp depreciation that the Mexican peso suffered towards the end of last 
year. In general, the inflation outlook has continued to improve in the region, opening 
room for further monetary stimulus. In addition, the external imbalances have moderated 
and the fiscal accounts continue to consolidate. Still, there is only weak support for a 
more robust expansion in the region. 
In this context, there has been a widespread increase in risk appetite, raising stock prices, 
reducing sovereign premiums and boosting capital flows into the emerging world (figure 
11). The terms of trade also show a significant improvement, largely due to a combination 
of higher prices for copper and lower for oil than assumed in December. The prices of 
other export products have also risen. Copper has remained at its highest price in two 
years.  This  responds  partly  to  the  aforementioned  better  performance  of  the 
manufacturing sectors and the better world growth outlook. Another part is explained by 
supply disruptions in some important producers and the lack of new investments. Thus, 
we have risen our projections of its price to US$2.55 and US$2.50 per pound for 2017 
and 2018, respectively. The oil price, after some rise after the agreement between OPEC 
and other producers to reduce output, has fallen in recent weeks. Our baseline scenario 
foresees it close to 50 dollars per barrel in the projection horizon. With this, in 2017 and 
2018 the terms of trade should not only outperform 2016, but should also be higher than 
was anticipated in December (table 2). 
 
6 
In the baseline scenario, monetary policy is providing a somewhat stronger impulse than 
estimated in December. As a working assumption we assume that the MPR will follow a 
trajectory similar to the one implied by financial asset prices during the ten days prior to 
this statistical closing of this Report. Thus, we assure that monetary policy will have 
responded swiftly to the changes in economic conditions and will remain expansionary 
through the whole projection horizon (figure 12). As always, the conduct of monetary 
policy and any possible  adjustments to the MPR will be contingent on the effects of 
incoming information on the projected inflation dynamic. 
On the external front, there are some sources of uncertainty that may have significant 
effects but by their nature are very hard to quantify. For example, political and economic 
uncertainty surrounding European elections, worries about Brexit implementation and 
possible shifts towards protectionism in several developed economies. Other risks that 
have long lingered in the external scenario have varied in intensity. The US economy has 
evolved favorably, averting the risk of a new recession. The much awaited fiscal impulse 
could help to sustain somewhat higher growth in the years to come. However, it is also a 
source of risk, as its implementation may have problems or inflationary effects that might 
trigger  a  faster  withdrawal  of  the  monetary  impulse,  creating  disruptions  in  financial 
markets. China continues to be a source of concern, especially its leverage, although its 
authorities  have  successfully  weathered  its  gradual  slowdown  without  causing 
disruptions, and this has been welcomed by markets.  
Neither can we rule out an intensification of the recent global trends and a stronger than 
expected impulse from abroad, by either a steeper recovery of world activity and/or better 
commodity prices. Some of this seems to have permeated financial markets, where the 
prices of riskier assets have risen. Although it is still premature to validate such optimism, 
it is clear that the markets are in a better mood than last year, including local markets, 
which have even been outperforming many of their peers. 
On the domestic front, after several years of subdued growth, we cannot rule out that a 
more persistent phenomenon may be affecting the economy’s ability to grow, in which 
case spending plans of both public and private agents would need some revision. One 
area calling for special attention is the labor market. While acknowledging that it has 
gradually adjusted without significantly increasing unemployment in the past several 
years, it is possible that, after years of low growth companies wish to make more drastic 
changes in their payrolls, particularly if the expected growth recovery towards the end 
of  the  year  stalls.  In  contrast,  in  a  context  where  no  macroeconomic  imbalances  are 
hindering growth, a scenario where an improved external outlook consolidates, plus the 
end of a cycle of mining investment adjustments and a rebound in sentiment, could lead 
to a more dynamic recovery than expected. 
 
All considered, the Board believes that the risk balance for both inflation and activity is 
unbiased. 
Summing  up,  inflation  has  evolved  in  line  with  December  forecasts.  However,  the 
economy has been weaker, widening the activity gap beyond expectations and reducing 
inflationary  pressures.  Accordingly,  the  Board  deemed  it  appropriate  to  enhance  the 
 
7 
     monetary stimulus between January and March. Going forward, we believe that it will be 
necessary to increase this monetary impulse a bit more, using as a working assumption 
that the MPR will follow a a trajectory similar to the one implied by financial asset prices 
during the ten days prior to this statistical closing of this Report. As always, we reaffirm 
our commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation 
stands at 3% in the policy horizon. 
 I will now share some final thoughts. 
Final thoughts 
The evolution of the economy in recent years has brought great challenges for monetary 
policy making around the world. The actions of central banks were paramount to take the 
world out of the financial crisis of 2008-2009 and to prevent a relapse in the following 
years, especially in those countries with less room for fiscal maneuvering. During this 
long period the effectiveness of monetary  policy to influence inflation and economic 
activity was called into question. Though less dramatic than in other places, in Chile this 
discussion is also revisited every now and then. 
Before responding to the question of how effective monetary policy is, we must clarify 
two points: what objective does it pursue, and how does it operate,  and  then we  can 
explore whether the means contribute to the ends.  
Chile’s institutionality assigns the Central Bank two main functions: to safeguard the 
stability  of  prices  and  the  stability  of  the  payment  system,  understood  as  financial 
stability. The first of these objectives has been specified under the regime of flexible 
inflation targeting, and has governed us for over 15 years, setting the target that annual 
expected CPI inflation must stand at 3% in a two-year horizon. This regime also considers 
a floating exchange rate, where the Bank reserves the possibility of intervening in the 
market, a power it has exercised barely four times since this policy came into effect in 
1999. 
This should clarify what lies beyond the objectives of our Monetary Policy: on the one 
hand, under the foreign exchange policy I have just described, we do not have a target for 
the exchange rate. We allow it to settle freely in the market responding to local interest 
rates and its other macroeconomic determinants. This is relevant because, as the empirical 
evidence  shows,  in  small,  open  economies  the  exchange  rate  is  an  important  shock 
absorbing mechanism.  
Second, our target is not short-term inflation, but longer-term inflation. Thus, to the extent 
that inflation fluctuations are perceived as transient, they should not have much impact 
on our policy decisions. A good example of this is the steep increase in inflation we had 
between 2014 and 2016. This process originated largely in a shock to the exchange rate 
that  had  transitory  effects  on  inflation.  Of  course,  the  duration  of  the  period  of  high 
inflation was long, but it responded to a succession of different shocks and not to the 
persistent effect of a single one.  
 
8 
        On the contrary, whenever we identify medium-term pressures on inflation, either upward 
or downward, we must react with vigor. The same episode which I have just referred to 
is illustrative in this regard. While in the short term inflation rose as a result of a shock 
on the exchange rate, with transitory effects, medium-term pressures diminished as a 
result of a deteriorating economy. Had our target been short-term inflation, we should 
have raised the MPR. As it is not, and what we aim at is medium-term inflation, our 
decision was to lower the MPR to prevent inflation two years out from falling below the 
3% target. 
This response of monetary policy is very different from its not so distant past. In the 
1990s, when our economy was not yet sufficiently prepared to deal with a currency shock, 
the Bank had to choose between an inflation target and an exchange rate target. The result 
of the exercise was complex for the Chilean economy. Not to mention what happened in 
the early 1980s, when the defense of a pegged exchange rate and changes in external 
financial conditions led us to a recession that cost us 15% of lost GDP and escalating 
unemployment. Applying our present scheme, monetary policy, coupled with a fiscal 
policy  based  on  a  structural  balance  sheet,  has  achieved  its  inflation  objectives  by 
dampening external and domestic shocks more strongly. The turbulences that in the past 
caused recessions in Chile, today are manifested only as changes in the pace of growth.  
To this end, monetary policy operates through several channels. Primarily, it regulates 
market  liquidity  and  it  sets,  through  open  market  operations,  an  interest  rate  for  the 
provision of liquidity to the financial system at very short terms. By way of these two 
mechanisms it affects market interest rates, which are the ones that influence asset prices 
and economic agents’ decisions. 
The  effectiveness  of  monetary  policy  therefore  depends  on  the  operation  of  these 
mechanisms at different levels. First, the Bank's ability to ensure the provision of liquidity 
is  critical,  as  it  maintains  market  interest  rates  aligned  with  the  MPR.  This  is  done 
regularly through open market operations and the Bank itself operates systems that allow 
these operations to be carried out with the appropriate standards. There may be cases 
where there is a sudden rise in market rates, because players in the system are faced with 
potential or actual liquidity constraints. Such a situation occurred in 2008, when events 
associated with the collapse of Lehman Brothers swept over the world economy. On that 
occasion, the Bank announced to the market that it would resort to exceptional liquidity 
provision mechanisms in pesos and dollars, which allowed local rates not to be altered, 
despite severe external risks.  
Although  the  Bank's  monetary  policy  instrument  is  the  short-term  interest  rate,  its 
movements affect the complete yield curve. The effectiveness of changes in the MPR in 
this  area  hinges  on  the  credibility  of  the  Bank's  decisions  as  perceived  by  economic 
agents. Here there are several areas, within which communication and transparency of 
decisions  are  essential.  To  the  extent  that  individuals  and  companies  understand  and 
validate  the  Bank's  decisions,  their  consumption  and  investment  decisions  will  be 
consistent with the described scenarios, as well as with asset prices and market rates. For 
these  reasons,  the  Bank  makes  special  efforts  be  transparent  and  to  communicate  its 
decisions and scenarios in the best possible way. We publish a wide range of information 
 
9 
     and all members of the Board are constantly making presentations to raise awareness of 
the Bank's vision, among many other efforts. 
Other important factors in the effectiveness of monetary policy are the changes in the 
external scenario. Being a small, open economy, Chile is subject to the vagaries of other 
countries. As we have said time and again, we can cushion their effects, but we cannot 
isolate ourselves from them. In that sense, significant fluctuations in the external scenario 
that, for example, produce unexpected or major changes in capital flows and external 
financial conditions, could affect local market rates. Again, the Bank's ability to provide 
liquidity  that  compensates  for  possible  changes  in  external  conditions  is  vital.  The 
example of 2008 I just described is relevant here too. 
It will not go unnoticed that several of these mechanisms also affect economic activity. 
For example, to the extent that a reduction of the MPR is properly transmitted to the cost 
of  interbank  funding,  financial  institutions  may  offer  better  credit  conditions  to  their 
clients  or,  based  on  a  better  spread,  bring  to  their  portfolio  of  clients  people  and 
companies that were left out before because of, for example, a higher risk assessment. At 
the same time, as people and companies see a more attractive offer of credit in terms of 
amounts or costs, they will decide to spend and thereby boost activity. 
Central banks are often caricatured as obsessed with inflation and indifferent to economic 
activity. Nothing further from the reality. The deviations of growth are very relevant for 
the evolution of inflation in the medium term, which means they play a fundamental role 
in our actions. The closer GDP is to its potential, the closer inflation will be to its medium-
term  target.  Moreover,  in  the  great  majority  of  cases,  monetary  policy  influences 
economic activity and inflation in the same direction, which is not surprising since both 
tend  to  correlate  within  the  business  cycle.  This  is  especially  important  when  the 
economy is in a weak phase of the cycle and a monetary stimulus can raise inflation and 
boost domestic demand. In any case, one must always keep in mind whether a persistent 
drop in activity is the result of a cyclical problem in the economy or responds to a more 
permanent phenomenon, such as lower potential growth. In the latter case, it is not evident 
that the output gap is much wider in the face of a slowdown and, therefore, it is not evident 
that medium-term inflationary pressures are lower. 
Again, the conduct of monetary policy of the past few years is a good example of how it 
implicitly  ensures  economic  stability,  as  its  stance  remained  expansionary  even  with 
annual inflation rates above 4%, understanding that they obeyed to an exceptional episode 
of exchange rate depreciation. 
The  prolonged  period  of  low  growth  that  Chile  has  endured  in  recent  years  has  put 
downward pressures on medium-term inflation. Therefore, within this framework that I 
have  described,  monetary  policy  has  been  and  will  continue  to  be  expansionary. 
Measuring how expansionary monetary policy is, is no easy task. Typically, the so-called 
neutral rate is used as a benchmark. Our most recent estimates, which we reported in a 
box in our Monetary Policy Report of last September, place it between 1% and 1.5% in 
real  terms.  With  a  real  MPR  that  is  now  at  zero  and  with  the  prospect  of  a  further 
reduction  in  the  near  future,  which  we  use  as  a  working  assumption  for  the  baseline 
 
10 
      scenario of this Report, there is no doubt that we are providing a considerable boost to 
the economy. Even more importantly, longer-term real rates are also below or around 
these  levels,  reflecting  that  the  market  considers  that  monetary  policy  not  only  is 
expansionary  now,  but  is  expected  to  remain  so  for  some  time,  in  line  with  the 
communications of the Bank itself.  
The lower interest rates are reflected not only in the record-low level of risk-free rates, 
but also in that borrowing costs are now very low by historic standards. This applies both 
to mortgage loans and to commercial and consumer loans. The exchange rate has also 
reacted.  In  nominal  terms,  the  peso  is  now  about  35%  below  its  levels  of  mid-2013. 
Compared with other countries, however, the behavior of our currency has been similar, 
so that multilateral and real depreciation have been less. Finally, from the perspective of 
other countries that have had cycles similar to ours, monetary policy rates in Chile are 
among the lowest in real terms. 
Nonetheless,  we  must  recognize  that,  even  in  normal  situations,  the  effectiveness  of 
monetary policy is not guaranteed, but depends on its correct implementation. This means 
respecting certain basic principles. Monetary policy, first and foremost, must be coherent 
with its policy framework and the situation of the country. This implies refraining from 
favoring short-term objectives, but rather calibrate the monetary impulse in such a way 
that projected inflation stands at 3% over a two-year horizon. Consistency is especially 
important to avoid unnecessary ups and downs in the economy causing market confusion. 
Its implementation must also be timely, which requires having enough information for a 
better understanding of the economic environment, and acting promptly when changes 
occur.  Obviously  this  entails  taking  some  risks,  as  certainty  is  always  elusive.  One 
example of this may come from the recent evolution of monetary policy conduct in Chile. 
At our presentation before this Committee last December, we noted that our baseline 
scenario featured as a working assumption that the monetary stimulus would be boosted 
by  50  basis  points,  which  would  be  done  in  the  following  months.  New  information 
convinced us that such impulse would need to be speeded up, so we took action in our 
monetary policy meetings of January and March. Moreover, the Report I am presenting 
you now uses a MPR trajectory that goes al little further as a working assumption. Also, 
as  always,  as  circumstances  change  and  the  medium-term  inflation  outlook  varies, 
monetary policy will be adjusted accordingly. 
Furthermore, monetary policy and its underlying diagnosis must be persistent enough for 
it  to  influence  economic  decisions  regarding  saving,  investment  and  pricing,  which 
operate with significant lags. In Chile, estimates indicate that it takes from two to eight 
quarters for a MPR movement to completely pass through to the economy. Now, this can 
vary if economic conditions are complex or the magnitude of the impulse is estimated to 
be still not large enough. The events in the developed world during recent years provide 
a  good  example.  After  the  crisis  of  2008-2009  the  Federal  Reserve  increased  the 
monetary impulse beyond the usual limits set by the interest rate. It not only took it to 
zero percent, but it also added a quantitative boost through the purchase of bonds. In a 
normal environment, it probably would have been unnecessary to take the impulse to 
such extremes, and probably the economy would have taken less time to react. However, 
 
11 
     the post-crisis damage was very large and only the persistence of the momentum has 
allowed  the  US  economy  to  make  a  successful  recovery  after  nine  years.  We  see 
something  similar  in  Europe,  with  the  difference  that  they  took  longer  to  apply  the 
stimulus,  suffered  a  banking  crisis  in  2011  and,  in  addition,  the  very  agreement 
procedures of the European Community make it more difficult to take extreme decisions. 
Finally, as I said, monetary policy must be credible, in order for the economic agents’ 
reactions to its impulses to be in line with the objective.  If inflation expectations are 
aligned with the two-year-ahead target of 3%, agents’ decisions, market interest rates, 
and financial asset prices will harmonize with low, stable inflation. 
The need for persistence and credibility raises a warning about how inefficient an interest 
rate reduction may be if perceived as temporary by the market. This is very important, 
because  in  practice  if  agents  consider  that  a  rate  cut  will  be  very  short  lived,  it  will 
probably have no meaningful effect on the yield curve or on the decisions of households 
and businesses. Moreover, costs could outweigh the potential benefits. If agents consider 
the downturn not only to be ineffective but also to compromise the achievement of the 
inflation target, a much less expansionary monetary policy could be necessary to realign 
inflation expectations. 
Thus, the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on our ability to timely diagnose the 
state of the economy and its implications on inflation, to respond consistently in setting 
the  policy  rate,  giving  it  sufficient  persistence  to  operate  and  generate  the  necessary 
credibility  for  markets  to  respond  in  accordance  with  the  expected  results  of  these 
interventions. At the Central Bank we are committed to ensuring these conditions. With 
this, monetary policy will continue to contribute to the country's welfare by maintaining 
low and stable inflation, cushioning the volatility of the business cycle. 
Likewise, although the Central Bank does not have the instruments to directly influence 
the growth potential of the country, it can indirectly contribute by preventing the loss of 
welfare  that  results  from  economic  volatility;  reducing  uncertainty  to  encourage 
investment,  production,  employment  and  consumption  decisions,  and  contributing  to 
make the financial sector safer and more efficient for the benefit of the entire population. 
Thank you.
