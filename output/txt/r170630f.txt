It is wonderful to be here in Bradford, just a few miles away from where I grew up.  The City has of course a 
rich commercial history dating from the Industrial Revolution.  Back then, it was a thriving hub for textiles and 
other manufacturing industries.  The City’s architecture bears witness to the rich civic investment that took 
place around this time, with the public and private sector often working in partnership.  The decline of the UK 
textiles industry from the mid-20th century was mirrored in Bradford’s own fortunes.  Like many industrial 
cities, Bradford went through a wrenching transition and still bears some of the scars.  
  But that retreating tide now seems, decisively, to have turned.  I am delighted to see civic and commercial 
investment beginning to return to Bradford over the past few years.  Those scars are starting to heal.  Of 
course, there is plenty still left to do with parts of the City still among the poorest in the UK.  But compared 
with when I last visited a few years ago, there is now a real sense of opportunity and optimism in Bradford, 
lifting the spirits of the businesses operating here and the people living here. 
 Regional visits such as these are the most useful and most interesting part of my job.  Over the course of two 
days, I will speak and listen to over two dozen businesses of all shapes, sizes and sectors.  I will speak and 
listen to a number of charities, not-for-profit enterprises and schools.  I will do a walkabout in Sunbridge 
Wells, an underground parade for retail and leisure and a great example of that civic investment and 
entrepreneurial spirit operating once again in the City.  And I will have with me a film crew, distilling some of 
the key bits of my visit to a wider audience across the whole of the UK.    
 This is part of a renewed effort by the Bank, under Mark Carney’s leadership, to engage with as wide a 
cross-section of people, and as broad a range of views, as possible.  Events of the past twelve months – 
indeed, events of the past twelve days – have illustrated just how important it is for policymakers to do so.  
To listen as often as we speak;  to try and better understand the issues people tell us matter to them, rather 
than the issues we tell them ought to matter to them;  to close that gap between “us” and “them”.  With the 
fortunes of the economy uncertain, the value of this grassroots intelligence has never been greater.   
 So where is the UK economy at this critical juncture?  Overall, the picture is a reasonably reassuring one.  
The UK economy has grown for 17 consecutive quarters.  Output has increased by around 2% over the past 
year, just a little below its historic trend rate.  Employment in the UK is at its highest rate since 1973.  
Unemployment is currently at its lowest since 1975.  Confidence among businesses and consumers remains 
solid.  And inflation, which had been below its 2% target for three years, has bounced back sharply recently. 
 Nonetheless, the UK economy clearly does face a number of important challenges.  Consumer price inflation 
(CPI), at 2.9%, is currently well above the government’s inflation target of 2%.  It is likely to move further 
above that target during the course of this year, probably reaching 3%.  Meanwhile, growth in the UK has 
slowed fairly sharply since the end of last year, as higher prices squeeze households’ purchasing power in 
the shops.  Activity in the UK economy remains below its long-run potential.  And, of course, all of this is 
before the full effects of Brexit have been felt.

Facing these uncertainties, a key issue for policymakers on the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is 
how best to navigate these risks and the trade-offs that currently exist between wages and jobs, activity and 
inflation.  These risks are genuinely two-sided.  Keeping monetary policy too loose for too long, to support 
jobs and activity, might run unnecessary risks with the inflation target.  But tightening monetary policy too 
soon or too quickly, to curb inflationary pressures, might run unnecessary risks with output and jobs.     
 Given the lags with which it operates, these monetary policy judgements depend not just on inflation and 
output today, but on their expected path in the period ahead.  For example, current UK inflation is being 
boosted significantly, but temporarily, by price pressures arising from sterling’s depreciation last year.  Once 
these effects abate, the path of inflation will depend on the evolution of domestic costs.  The behaviour of 
wages, and developments in the jobs market more generally, will be crucial in determining that evolution. 
 That being the case, I wish to begin by discussing some of the factors affecting wage growth, in the recent 
past and in the future, including those arising from structural shifts in the nature of work.  I will then turn to 
the implications of recent developments in the economy for monetary policy in the period ahead. 
 Work and Wages 
 Wages have been surprisingly weak for much of the period since the global financial crisis.  Chart 1 plots 
successive Bank of England forecasts of wage growth since 2012.  Wage growth in the UK has persistently 
disappointed to the downside, on average by around 1 ¼ percentage points one year ahead.  Part of the 
explanation lies in weak UK productivity, a key determinant of firms’ ability to pay workers.  This, too, has 
persistently disappointed to the downside, with a mean error of around 1 percentage point one year ahead.   
 Nonetheless, it is clear that wages have been weaker than can be explained either by slow productivity 
growth or by the other factors which typically affect wages, including the degree of slack in the labour market.  
This can be seen by looking at the unexplained components from the Bank’s wage equations (Chart 2).  
These residuals have been predominantly negative over recent years.  That is despite on-going refinements 
to the Bank’s judgements on the labour market, as wages have come in short of expectations.   
 This weakness in wages is the more surprising because it has come against a backdrop of a booming jobs 
market in the UK.  Employment has increased by around 2.5 million people since 2011.  Unemployment in 
the UK has fallen from its peak of 8.5% in 2011 to almost 4.5% currently.  It has also fallen significantly in 
every region in the UK.  Here in Yorkshire, unemployment has fallen from 10% to around 5% over the past 
few years, its lowest level since the 1970s. 
 Historically, there has been a reasonably strong and stable relationship between unemployment and wage 
growth – the so-called Phillips curve.  As unemployment has fallen recently, this Phillips curve relationship 
would have led us to expect wage growth to pick up.  That, plainly, has not happened. Over recent years, the

Phillips curve relationship has been anything but strong and stable (Chart 3).  And that same flatness in the 
Phillips curve has been found in a number of other countries (Chart 4).   
 
There are many potential causes of the weak wage puzzle over recent years.1  Some of these are likely to 
have been short-lived, such as the impact of low actual and expected levels of inflation globally.  Others are 
likely to have been longer-lived, such as the impact of the financial crisis on slack in the labour market and 
workers’ willingness to move between jobs in search of a pay rise.  A third set of factors are structural in 
nature.  For example, there is evidence technology and globalisation may have weakened the bargaining 
power of workers, leading to a secular fall in the share of income going to workers in several countries.2 
 Another set of longer-term factors arise from the changing nature of work and the shifting relationship 
between employers and employees.  One such shift, which has operated over a number of decades, is the 
decreasing incidence of unionisation and collective bargaining in the workforce.  Other, more recent, shifts 
include the increasing incidence of self-employment, flexible and part-time working and zero-hours contracts.  
These shifts in the nature and quality of work have become very topical recently.  The UK government has 
commissioned an independent review, chaired by Matthew Taylor, to look into their impact.3   
 These changes in working customs, contracts and practices have been given a variety of descriptions.  
Some have called them the “casualisation” of work, with jobs becoming less structured and more informal.4  
Others have called them the “gig” economy, with work becoming less four-cornered and more task-oriented.5  
Other still have associated these changes with heightened “insecurity” in the jobs market, with implications 
for households’ incomes and spending.6  All of these descriptions recognise that these shifts affect the 
quality of work in the economy, even as the quantity reaches levels not seen for many decades.7 
 Because the causes and consequences of these shifts in working practices are many and varied, no single 
description of them is perfect.  Surveys suggest that, for some people, the move to greater self-employment 
and part-time working has been a welcome development, increasing the degree of control and flexibility over 
their working lives.  For others, these same shifts are less a lifestyle choice than a necessity, increasing their 
degree of uncertainty and concern about income and jobs.  Gigging can be fun for some.  But not everyone 
wants to be a roadie when it comes to the world of work. 
 Perhaps a more neutral, if less catchy, description of these trends is needed.  In terms of their economic 
impact, these trends have had the effect of making work more “divisible” than in the past.  The fall in 
unionisation has made workers more divisible at the level of the profession, sector or firm.  Wage bargaining

is less likely to be collective, and more likely to be idiosyncratic, these days.  Similarly, the rise in  
self-employment and part-time working has made work more divisible at the level of the individual worker.  
People are more likely these days to be paid by the task or the hour.  In short, these shifts have meant work 
and workers may have become more diffuse, more granular, more divisible than in the past. 
 This increased “divisibility” of jobs and work potentially raises a number of important issues, economic and 
social, about the relationship between employee and employer, many of which are being tackled by the 
Taylor Review.  I want to explore just one dimension - the extent to which they may have influenced  
wage-setting in the economy.  In particular, it is worth exploring whether these changes may have 
contributed, in any way, to the weak wage puzzle experienced over recent years.  And, if so, given that these 
trends are likely to persist, whether they carry implications for the durability of wage weakness too.   
 Why, in principle, might these changes affect wage behaviour?  One story here is “divide and conquer”.  
There is power in numbers.  A workforce that is more easily divided than in the past may find itself more 
easily conquered.  In other words, a world of divisible work may reduce workers’ wage-bargaining power.  
Another story is that more flexible working practices may have induced previously inactive people back into 
work.  With more people willing to enter employment, upward pressure on wages may be dampened even as 
labour demand picks up given the higher rate of labour market participation in the economy.   
 In either case, the downstream consequences would be similar:  weaker wage growth than in the past, for a 
given level of unemployment or demand in the economy.  That is the theory.  What empirical evidence is 
there to support these stories? 
 The Changing Nature of Work 
 Let me start by outlining some of the facts on the changing nature of work and the divisibility of labour.  
 At the level of the profession or sector, one clear diagnostic comes from the changing pattern of unionisation.  
In 1990, around 38% of employees in Great Britain belonged to a trade union.  That membership rate has 
steadily declined over time, extending a broad trend apparent since at least the mid-1970s.  In 2016, 
membership of trade unions stood at 23% (Chart 5).  Today, around 6 million employees are members of 
trade unions, less than half the peak of around 13 million in the late-1970s.   
 That fall in union membership rates has been broadly based.  It has applied to both males and females, 
although the fall in membership has been greater among males with rates falling from 35% in 1995 to 21% 
today.  It has occurred in both the public and private sectors, although public sector employees remain 
around four times more likely to be union members.  And it has been true across all age groups, although 
rates of union membership tend to be lowest among younger cohorts, with rates among the 16-24 age cohort 
8% compared with 30% for those aged 50 and over.

The fact that unionisation rates have been falling within each age cohort over time, and are lowest among 
the young, suggests the downward trend in rates of unionisation may still have some distance to travel.  For 
example, if unionisation rates were to continue to decline at the same average rate as over the past decade, 
then they are likely to fall to around 10% of employees, or 3 million people, within a generation. 
 A more recent labour market trend is the increased importance of self-employment.  In 1980, the  
self-employed accounted for less than 8% of the workforce.  In 2016, they stood at an historic high of around 
15%, or around 4 ¼ million people (Chart 6).  The increase in self-employment has occurred within each age 
cohort, although the pick-up has been greatest among the old.  In 1990, 30% of the self-employed hired 
other workers.  Today, that share is around 16%, with more of the self-employed working independently.8   
 As with decreasing unionisation, it seems unlikely these trends will reverse.  As older workers are more likely 
to be self-employed, the ageing of the population will by itself generate further increases.  As a rough  
ready-reckoner, were the incidence of self-employment in each age group to remain constant, the ageing of 
the population would by itself generate an extra 100,000 self-employed people over the next decade.  If 
numbers in self-employment kept on increasing at the same rate as in the past, the increase could be much 
more substantial, perhaps as much as an extra 1 million people over the next decade. 
 A more recent phenomenon in the labour market – and one which has attracted particular attention – is the 
“zero hours” contract.  As recently as 2010, 0.6% of those in employment were on zero hours contracts, 
around 170,000 people.  By 2016, that had increased to almost 3% of employees, or almost 1 million 
workers (Chart 7).  It is unclear how much of the measured increase in zero hours contracts is a genuine 
trend, rather than reflecting increased awareness and reporting.  But if those rates of expansion continued, 
the share of employees on zero-hours contracts would reach around 7% within a decade. 
 Trends in temporary and part-time work have been less striking, but have gone in the same direction.  
Between 1997 and 2008, temporary work declined as a share of employment.  But since 2008 it has 
increased.  There are currently around 200,000 more temporary workers than before the financial crisis.  
Prior to the crisis, around 25% of those in employment worked part-time.  Since the crisis, that share has 
increased to around 26%, or around 8 ½ million workers.   
 If we took together self-employment, part-time and temporary working and zero-hours contracts, their share 
of the workforce has probably risen to around 43%, or around 13 ½ million workers.9  The corresponding 
figures back in 2000 would have been around 39% of the workforce, or around 10 ½ million workers.  This is 
not a majority, but it is a significant and rising minority of workers. 
                                                       
8  For example, Blanchflower and Machin (2017).  
9  There needs to be caution when simply summing these categories as some of them probably overlap, generating double-counting.

These trends in self-employment, temporary and part-time employment are based on survey data.  Those 
broad trends are corroborated if we look at data on job vacancies rather than employment.10  By searching 
for words such as “self-employed”, “flexible hours” and “contractor” in published job ads, we can track trends 
in the demand for jobs with these characteristics.  This suggests all three job classifiers have maintained or 
increased their shares of vacancies since 2008 (Chart 8).   
 On the face of it, these trends – less union membership, more self-employment, more zero hours contracts, 
more part-time and temporary work – might suggest work has become more fluid and insecure.  But we 
should be cautious about jumping to that conclusion.  Over the past three years, there has been a marked 
increase in the share of temporary workers reporting they do not want a permanent job.  And since 2012, the 
share of part-time workers reporting that they do not want a full-time job has also been on an upward 
trajectory.   
 Whether these trends in employment are voluntary or involuntary, good news or bad, an opportunity or a 
threat, they may still carry implications for wage-setting.  That is true even if it is only a (rising) minority of 
workers being affected by these changes.  The marginal worker is much more likely than in the past to be 
self-employed, to work flexibly and to not be part of a union.  And, economics and employers tell us, it is the 
marginal worker whose pay matters most when determining wage pressures in the economy at large.  
 Implications for Wages 
 So what does the evidence tell us about the potential effects of these changes in patterns of work on wages?  
One source is empirical research on wage behaviour. This literature is best-developed in the area of 
unionisation.  It suggests there is a clear wage premium associated with trade union membership, even once 
we take account of differences in workers’ skills, sectors and regions.11 
 There are a number of possible reasons for this wage premium, including the greater bargaining power union 
membership confers.  There are also a wide range of estimates of the scale of this wage premium.  These 
appear to vary widely across different countries, regions and sectors.  Nonetheless, estimates of the 
aggregate wage premium in the UK are typically centred in the range 10-15%.12  There is evidence this wage 
premium may have shrunk over time, perhaps reflecting diminished union membership or increased 
competition in the labour market.13  And there is also evidence decreased unionisation may have made 
wage-setting more dispersed and localised.14 
                                                       
10  This is based on data from Reed on around 15 million advertised job vacancies between 2008 and 2016.  There are various possible 
reasons for ‘self-employment’ being included within a job vacancy description.  These may include reduced National Insurance 
contributions and increased flexibility over working hours.

Given that the number of unionised workers has been falling over time, the wage premium from unionisation 
will have had a direct, “batting average”, effect on wage growth as fewer workers benefit from this premium.  
For example, with a wage premium of 15%, the shift in union membership since 2000 would have subtracted 
around 1 per cent from wages over the period, or less than 6 basis points from average annual wage growth.  
This effect is modest but, to my mind, is very likely a lower bound.  For example, it takes no account of the 
broader spill over effects of unionised wages on the wages of other workers.  
 There is evidence self-employment, flexible working and zero-hours contracts also affect wages, after 
controlling for differences in occupations and locations.  For example, self-employment has been found to be 
associated with a wage discount for workers, perhaps in the region of 15%.15  The reasons given for this 
discount include the fact that workers may be willing to accept a lower wage in return for the increased 
control and flexibility that comes from self-employment.16  There may also be problems in recording 
accurately income from self-employment. 
 
For workers on temporary contracts, there is also evidence of a wage discount, perhaps of around 5-6%.17  
For agency workers, the wage discount is smaller, perhaps around 2 ½%.  For zero hours contract workers, 
it is larger at around 7%.  If we take trends in self-employment, temporary and zero-hours contract workers 
since 2000, we would expect these to have collectively directly subtracted from wages by around 0.6 per 
cent, or around 4 basis points from annual wage growth.18  Again, although these estimates are modest they 
probably understate the true effect, given they ignore any behavioural effects of these trends. 
 Wages are not the only way in which these shifts in the nature of work may have affected labour market 
behaviour.  As with unionisation, these shifts may also have widened the dispersion of wage rates within a 
given sector or occupation, with less collective-bargaining and more localised rates of pay.  Vacancies data 
lend some support to this hypothesis.  Charts 9 and 10 plot the distribution of offered wage rates in different 
occupations, comparing job vacancies containing the terms “self-employment” and “flexible hours” with those 
that do not. 
 These vacancies data probably capture a particular segment of the self-employed and flexible working 
population, who differentiate their pay by more than the typical self-employed worker.  Indeed, the  
‘self-employed’ vacancies here are advertised by firms who invite applicants to become self-employed before 
hiring them.  Nonetheless, these “violin” plots of offered wage distributions play an interesting tune.  The 
distribution of offered wage rates is far wider for vacancies associated with self-employment and flexible 
hours than those without, within a given occupation.  There is far less evidence of a “going-rate” for jobs 
associated with the self-employed and flexible working.  This sounds intuitively plausible. 
                                                      
15  Inferred from Bradley (2016), using the mean pay of the self-employed compared to employees. 
16  Hamilton (2000). 
17  Gardiner (2016). 
18  Because self-employed workers are not included in statistical measures of average weekly earnings, the self-employed effect would 
not have shown up arithmetically in this wages measure.  But there will still likely be general equilibrium effects on wage-setting in the 
economy for those who earn a salary.

A final piece of evidence, albeit indirect, comes from historical data.  The move towards greater  
self-employment and less unionisation is, in some respects, a shift back to the future in the nature of work.  
Prior to the Industrial Revolution, and indeed for some years after it, most workers were self-employed or 
worked in small businesses.  There were no unions.  Hours were flexible, depending on what work was 
needed to collect the crops, milk the cows or put bread on the table.  Work was artisanal, task-based, 
divisible. 
 
While the read-across to work patterns in the 21st century is far from exact, there are some parallels.  That 
being the case, one question is how wage- and price-setting behaviour operated during this earlier period of 
more “divisible” labour markets.  Were any of today’s wage patterns evident then?  The data we have on 
wages and output in earlier centuries are partial and imperfect, but nonetheless tell an interesting story. 
 Chart 11 plots UK Phillips curves over three periods:  1500-1700 (pre-Industrial Revolution);  1860-1950 
(post-Industrial Revolution);  1950-1977 and 1977 to date (post-war period).  In each case, wage inflation is 
measured on the y-axis and an estimate of the output gap on the x-axis.  In the post-war period, the Phillips 
curve conforms to type.  Since 1950, it has a clearly positive slope (less slack in the economy is associated 
with higher wage inflation) and an intercept which is positive (reflecting positive trend inflation).   
 The Phillips curves covering the periods either side of the Industrial Revolution are more interesting.  They 
share one important similarly and have one important difference.  The similarity is that both are associated 
with an average inflation rate of around zero.  This is consistent with the price level being broadly stable over 
these periods.   
 The striking difference is in the slope of the Phillips curve.  The post-Industrial Revolution Phillips curve has a 
conventional upward slope, similar to that operating after 1950.  Higher growth or lower unemployment is 
associated with higher rates of wage and price inflation.  The pre-Industrial Revolution Phillips curve is 
altogether different;  it is as flat as a pancake.  Indeed, it bears a close resemblance to the Phillips curves 
which have operated, in the UK and globally, since 2008.   
 There are many potential explanations of this flatness in the pre-Industrial Revolution Phillips curve, including 
noisy data.  And its similarity with the present-day Phillips curve may be purely coincidental.  Nonetheless, 
this pattern is at least consistent with a shift in working practices, towards a more divisible, idiosyncratic 
workforce, having contributed to a flatter Phillips curve relationship. 
 None of this evidence is definitive or decisive.  Taken together, however, it is at least suggestive that recent 
trends in the nature of work may have had some bearing both on wage-setting behaviour in general and on 
the weak wage puzzle in particular.  Shifts in working patterns seem very unlikely, by themselves, to have 
been the prime-mover of weak wages.  But they have probably been a contributor in the past and, more 
significantly, are likely to continue to do so in the future if these trends, as seems likely, perpetuate.

The Case for Holding Fire 
 Let me now turn to monetary policy.  Clearly, wages are a key factor when judging inflation pressures in the 
economy and the monetary policy stance.  Continuing the pattern since the crisis, recent wage growth has 
been, once again, surprisingly weak.  Despite unemployment falling to its lowest level, and employment 
rising to its highest level, in a generation, whole-economy wage growth has failed to pick-up.  Indeed, wage 
growth over recent months appears, if anything, to have been falling.   
 At the start of the year, the Bank of England Agents’ annual wage survey suggested pay settlements would 
slow from 2.7% last year to 2.2% this.  At the time, there was healthy scepticism within the Bank about these 
findings.  In the event, the Agents’ survey may, if anything, have understated the slowdown.  Annual growth 
in average weekly earnings peaked at 2.8% in November 2016.  It currently stands at 2.1%.  Excluding 
bonuses, it stands at 1.7%.  Data on pay settlements suggest that weak profile may persist.  Private sector 
wage settlements are currently running at around 2.0%, down from 3% a year ago. 
 These recent trends in wages, alongside further falls in unemployment, reinforce the impression of an 
exceptionally weak relationship between wages and employment, a pancake-like Phillips curve.  Indeed, it is 
testimony to the flatness of the Phillips curve that wage growth is at similar levels today to when 
unemployment was at its recent peak back in 2011.  The Bank’s May Inflation Report projections assume 
wage growth picks up to around 3 ¾% over the next three years.  Given that unemployment is projected to 
be broadly flat over that period, the tight labour market will have to exert increasing upward pressure on pay 
growth if this wage profile is to be realised.  Alternatively, whatever other factors have been dragging on pay 
growth will have to dissipate.  
 Of course, wages are not the only determinant of underlying inflation pressures.  That is why the Bank 
monitors a range of around 13 other indicators of domestically-generated inflation.  Each of these has their 
own imperfections, but they share the aim of filtering out temporary influences on underlying inflation.19 
Chart 12 shows a summary measure of these indicators of domestically-generated inflation, based on the 
common volatility across these indicators.20  Two features stand out. 
 First, there is clear evidence of a slow build in underlying inflation pressures in the UK economy since around 
2015, as slack has been absorbed.  Since then, domestically generated inflation has risen by around 0.5 
percentage points.   
 But, second, this nominal build has been very slow, despite rapid falls in unemployment.  Underlying inflation 
is estimated to be around the same level it was in 2013.  That leaves it around 0.7 percentage points below 
                                                      
19  While they will strip them out to some extent, these measures are not completely immune from external factors, such as changes in 
the exchange rate or commodity prices. 
20  Technically speaking, it is the first principal component of the Bank’s range of domestically-generated inflation measures.

the level consistent with hitting the inflation target.21  If it rose at similar rates to the past few years, during 
which slack was being eroded sharply, underlying inflation would still take another three years or so before it 
reached target-consistent levels.   
 As past rates of erosion in slack are unlikely to be replicated over the next three years, this suggests there 
could be downside risks to hitting the inflation target, unless the Phillips curve reasserts itself or nominal 
momentum in the economy picks up in the period ahead.  More generally, relatively low and slow rates of 
nominal build in the economy over the recent past provide one reason for caution when considering 
tightening the UK’s monetary stance, if the inflation target is to be hit on a sustainable basis.   
 A second factor which plays in the same direction is Brexit.  The Bank has already made some allowance for 
the effects of Brexit on the economy in its published projections for output and inflation since the referendum.  
One of those effects is that changes in the UK’s future trading arrangements are likely, over time, to drag on 
trade volumes (exports and imports), activity and productivity in the economy.22  Necessarily, given there are 
no previous episodes of this type, those impacts are uncertain.  They are also based on a set of assumptions 
about the Brexit process and its ultimate end-state, which may or may not be realised in practice. 
 For instance, underlying these Brexit effects is an assumption that the process is a smooth and orderly one.  
This is a strong assumption.  A number of market participants and external commentators believe there is a 
risk Brexit may be neither smooth nor orderly.  If so, that could prompt a discontinuous response by 
consumers and companies.  For example, if they were to begin building precautionary savings, this would 
affect growth significantly and adversely.  There could be a “Brexit break” in the economy.23 
 This discontinuity risk is difficult to dismiss.  Indeed, the risk of sharp, Brexit-induced, slowdown seems to be 
a key factor holding the sterling yield curve at its current low levels, according to market participants.  On this 
view, the sharp slowing of UK growth in the first quarter of this year could be the harbinger of things to come.  
And there are already signs of a sharp slowdown in big-ticket discretionary purchases by consumers, 
including houses, cars and household goods.  If this persisted, it too could justify monetary policymakers 
staying their hand.  It would be imprudent to add fuel to any contractionary fire with an early interest rate rise. 
 A final factor which, at least in principle, could be used to justify a continuing accommodative monetary policy 
stance is the level of the sterling yield curve.  This is remarkably flat and has become flatter over the course 
of this year, despite medium-term growth expectations being revised upwards.  Only one rise in UK interest 
                                                      
21 Based on the average of the different indicators’ deviation from their estimated “inflation target-consistent” rates.  These estimated 
target-consistent rates may not be an appropriate benchmark at the current juncture if the mix between domestically- and externally-
generated inflation consistent with overall inflation at target has changed over time.  For example, the trade integration of China into the 
global economy in the 2000s dragged on core goods inflation prior to the crisis and this may not repeat itself. 
22  Bank of England (2016). 
23  A “Brexit break” could also be associated with a material depreciation of sterling, putting upward pressure on inflation.  In this case, 
the appropriate reaction of monetary policy would be ambiguous, and it is possible that tightening, rather than loosening, may be 
warranted.

rates is fully priced in between now and late-2019.  Forward rates only reach 1% by 2023 and, remarkably, 
never reach 2%. 
 Given these expectations, any rise in interest rates in the immediate period ahead would come as a surprise 
to financial markets and, perhaps to a lesser extent, consumers and businesses.  Because people dislike 
nasty surprises, this increases the chances of an outsized response in spending or in asset prices, perhaps 
even one which catalysed a “Brexit break”.  This is a risk which, even if it is remote, is not easily dismissed. 
 Taken together, these factors – real, nominal, financial - make the case for maintaining the MPC’s current, 
accommodative, monetary policy stance.  And, until recently, it was those factors which weighed most 
heavily with me when framing my own view on the appropriate monetary policy stance. 
 The Case for Tightening 
 One of the keys to good policymaking is regular and critical self-examination of your arguments.  This devil’s 
advocacy can help expose soft spots in your policy judgement, especially at times when the data and the 
risks around the economy may be altering.  Those data and risks have, in my view, altered materially over 
the past nine months or so, for a number of reasons. 
 First, the world outlook is materially brighter than it has been for some time, perhaps at any time since the 
global financial crisis.  This year’s Spring Meetings of the IMF saw the first upgrade of world growth forecasts 
for six years.  As forecast errors tend to be serially correlated – forecasters’ models tend to smooth out the 
bumps and miss turning points - it is possible further upgrades to world growth could lie ahead.  
 One reason to believe stronger world growth may prove resilient is that it appears to have a broader base 
than in the recent past, both compositionally and regionally.  At a compositional level, there are early-stage 
signs that global growth may be rebalancing away from consumption and towards investment.  Since the 
crisis, global business investment has been structurally weak, growing around 2 percentage points below its 
pre-crisis average.  Meanwhile, growth in world trade has undershot world growth for the past 2 years, after a 
5-year period in which the opposite was true. 
 There are now signs those patterns are reversing.  Investment in the US, the euro area and China appears 
to be picking up.  So too is world trade.  Global supply chains appear to be widening and deepening, with 
global trade and capital goods orders rising (Chart 13).  It is possible greater optimism about world demand 
may be encouraging businesses to put their fortress balance sheets to work.  If so, that could herald the 
beginning of the end of the protracted post-crisis super-cycle of weak investment. 
 At a regional level, the global recovery appears to have a broad base across the world.  Most regions of the 
world have seen growth upgrades over the past six months.  Currently, countries representing around 80%

of global output are expected to be growing above-trend, meaning the global output gap is shrinking.  The 
simultaneity of that uptick in regional growth should give it greater momentum, given the increased 
importance these days of cross-border spillovers, in trade and finance, and integrated global supply chains. 
 A second reason for greater resilience in world growth since the start of the year is reduced political and 
policy uncertainty.  For anyone who has lived through the UK’s political undulations of the past few weeks, or 
who is consuming a daily diet of world news, blogs and tweets, that may sound like an odd statement.  But, 
viewed in the round, political and policy risks in a number of countries have eased significantly since the start 
of the year. 
 At the start of the year, there was widespread media and market concern about changes to economic, trade 
and foreign policy in the US.  By and large, the worst of these fears have failed to materialise.  At the start of 
the year, there were fears of a populist surge through Europe.  These risks have failed to crystallise, first in 
the Netherlands, most recently in France and most probably in Germany later this year.  This is not to 
suggest geo-political risk has disappeared, merely that some important risks have failed to come to pass. 
 Alongside upgrades to growth, this fall in political risk seems to have contributed to a rise in global asset 
prices and a fall in global risk premia.  Equity prices in the US and euro area have each increased by around 
8% since the start of the year.  The VIX, a measure of uncertainty in financial markets, has fallen to levels 
not seen since 2007 (Chart 14).  Media-based measures of uncertainty remain elevated.  But these measure 
political news, of which there has been plenty, rather than political uncertainty.  And it is the latter, rather than 
blogs, tweets and news feeds, that matter to most people when making decisions about spending.  
 Third, as the world economy has gathered pace and resilience, there are signs downside risks to global 
inflation have also eased.  In the middle of last year, the balance of inflation risks in the major regions 
seemed to be skewed to the downside.  Financial market expectations of inflation 5-to-10 years ahead were 
below their historic averages in the US (by around 80 basis points), the UK (40 basis points) and the  
euro-area (40 basis points).  Fears of deflation were, if not quite stalking the planet, then making a nuisance 
of themselves in a number of countries. 
 Since July last year, inflation expectations have risen by around 40bp in the UK and around 25bps in the US 
and euro-area (Chart 15).  The downside skew in inflation expectations appears to have dissipated.  And not 
just among market participants.  The shift in inflation narratives among the public has been every bit as 
striking.  Google searches for the word “deflation” are at their lowest level in several years, having been 
particularly elevated in 2015.  Searches for the word “reflation” have risen fourfold comparing the first quarter 
of this year with last (Chart 16).  Hopes of reflation have displaced fears of deflation as the popular narrative 
about global inflationary trends.

This shift in inflation expectations has important implications for monetary policy.  One of the concerns about 
below-target inflation was that any negative shock to demand could dislodge inflation expectations, requiring 
further stimulus at a time when the zero lower bound on interest rates potentially made this less effective.  
This asymmetry of risks can justify holding interest rates lower for longer, on “risk management” grounds.24  
With inflation expectations now having adjusted upwards, the need for such monetary policy insurance is 
now lower than nine months ago.   
 Fourth, closer to home, some of the worst of the post-referendum fears about UK growth have failed to 
materialise.  Growth has been more resilient than expected.  The Bank’s Inflation Report forecasts for UK 
growth in 2017 have been revised up by over a percentage point since last August.  Smoothing out the 
bumps, surveys of activity and confidence, among both consumers and businesses, have scarcely budged.  
Although a little weaker than last year, those surveys continue to point to solid, around-trend, growth.  
 What has clearly changed recently is the composition of UK growth.  Consumer spending has slowed, 
perhaps sharply, while there are signs business investment is picking up (Chart 17).  Surveys also suggest a 
strengthening outlook for exports.  With their balance sheets strong, their cost of capital low and with 
demand for their products – particularly from overseas – buoyant, UK companies may be emerging from 
under the duvet, putting their balance sheets to work.  If so, and even if aggregate growth is somewhat 
slower, this will make for better balanced and more resilient growth. 
 None of this is to suggest that the risks of a Brexit break have disappeared.  There are still enough straws in 
the wind to believe a sharper slowdown than expected is possible, with consumers’ spending on houses, 
cars and household goods all having slowed sharply.  And it might not take much of a squeeze on consumer 
demand to induce companies to return to their duvets.  But there has been no consistent evidence, so far at 
least, of this discontinuity risk having increased significantly during this year.   
 As for nominal pressures, there have been some signs of a stirring.  Consumer price inflation, at 2.9% in 
May, exceeded market expectations, as did measures of core inflation.  Sterling has fallen a further 3% since 
the May Inflation Report, largely the result of political events.  Mechanically, that fall would add around 0.2% 
to the level of GDP and around 0.2 percentage points to inflation at the two and three year horizon. Inflation 
was already expected to lie above the Bank’s target, and to be rising, at the year three horizon in the May 
Inflation Report.      
 Fifth, despite all of these positives, the sterling yield curve has overall tended to be fairly unresponsive, both 
to data news and to MPC communications.  Estimates of the responsiveness of the UK yield curve to  
macro-economic news have been below their longer-term averages throughout much of the past 18 months

(Chart 18).  Perhaps the lesson from US experience, where interest rates have been more responsive to 
data news and FOMC communications, is that it is policy actions, rather than words, that matter. 
 Sixth and finally, any tightening in policy needs to be put in context.  The first 25 basis point rise in UK 
interest rates for 10 years seems like a momentous step.  But it would still leave monetary policy highly 
accommodative by any historical metric.  A 25 basis point rise would do no more than remove a proportion – 
according to our GDP ready-reckoners, around a quarter – of the incremental stimulus the MPC provided last 
August.  In other words, a 25 basis point tightening would still leave the UK monetary policy stance 
significantly more accommodative than a year ago. 
 Conclusion 
 So where does this leave the balance of arguments?  Having weighed the evidence, I think that the balance 
of risks associated with tightening “too early”, on the one hand, and “too late”, on the other, has swung 
materially towards the latter in the past six to nine months.  The risks of tightening “too early” have shrunk as 
growth and, to lesser extent, inflation have shown greater resilience than expected.  And if policy tightened 
“too late”, this could result in a much steeper path of rate rises later on, contrary to the MPC’s collective 
expectation that Bank Rate would increase ‘at a gradual pace and to a limited extent’.25  
 As the balance point between these risks has shifted over the past 9 months, that has left me judging that a 
partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent 
relatively soon, provided the data come in broadly as expected in the period ahead.  Certainly, I think such a 
tightening is likely to be needed well ahead of current market expectations. 
 How soon is “relatively soon”?  I considered the case for a rate rise at the MPC’s June meeting.  I felt then 
there were strong grounds for holding back until later in the year, for two reasons.  First, despite upwards 
pressure on inflation, there are still few signs of higher wage growth.  And despite robust surveys, there is 
still some chance of a sharper than expected slowing in the economy.  Both are reasons for monetary policy 
not to rush its fences.  Nor does it need to do so, given the slow build of nominal pressures in the economy. 
 Second, there is the election.  This has thrown up a dust-cloud of uncertainty.  Financial markets-wise, that is 
manifesting itself in a weaker exchange rate.  It is unclear what twists and turns lie ahead, with potentially 
important implications for asset prices and, at least potentially, confidence among businesses and 
consumers.  I do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would, in this environment, be 
especially helpful in building confidence, at least until the dust-cloud has started to settle.

Provided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the 
incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year.  As and 
when the MPC begins this process of normalising monetary policy, it will be a sign of the economy itself 
having begun to normalise.  Far from being a cause for concern, starting the process of withdrawing some 
monetary policy insurance should serve as a signal of the MPC’s confidence in the UK economy’s resilience 
and in inflation returning sustainably to its 2% target. 
 The City of Bradford is itself normalising, after a long period of painful adjustment.  It has shown real 
resilience and an indomitable spirit during those lean years.  There are now reasons for optimism about the 
City’s future, as civic and commercial investment return and confidence among businesses and residents 
builds.  Those characteristics – resilience, spirit, optimism, investment, confidence – are ones the UK 
economy has also had to exhibit of late.  They are ones it will continue to need over the next few years 
during what is likely to be a bumpy ride.  Thank you.

Notes:  The chart shows the rolling 12 month beta coefficient of a regression of the UK Economic Surprise Index (ESI) on 
daily changes of UK 3-year interest rates, with a 95% confidence interval.  The ESI is calculated as the weighted sum of 
data surprises across the UK, US, euro area, Japan and China.  The data series included in the ESI, and the estimated 
weights are based on their historical relationship with daily changes in UK interest rates. The axis shows the impact of a 
1 standard deviation data surprise on UK 3-year interest rates.  The dashed line shows the 2004-2017 average for the 
beta coefficient.
