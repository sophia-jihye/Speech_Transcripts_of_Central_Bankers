 Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy 
Speech at the Kisaragi-kai Meeting in Tokyo 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
It is my great pleasure to have the opportunity today to speak at the Kisaragi-kai meeting. 
 The  last  time  I  gave  a  speech  at  the  Kisaragi-kai  meeting  was  early  September  last  year. 
Two  weeks  after  that,  the  Bank  of  Japan  conducted  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  the 
developments  in  economic  activity  and  prices  as  well  as  of  the  policy  effects  under 
quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary  easing  (QQE),  and  decided  to  introduce  a  new 
framework  for  strengthening  monetary  easing  --  "QQE  with  Yield  Curve  Control."  While 
more  than  a  year  has  passed  since  then,  highly  accommodative  financial  conditions  have 
been maintained in Japan under this framework, and the economy has continued to improve. 
Today,  I  would  like  to  first  explain  the  Bank's  view  on  the  recent  economic  and  price 
developments  in  Japan,  and  then  talk  about  its  thinking  behind  the  conduct  of  monetary 
policy. 
 I. The Current Situation of Economic Activity and Its Outlook 
Overseas Economies 
Let me start by talking about economic developments. I will first touch on developments in 
overseas economies. 
 Overseas economies have continued to improve steadily since mid-2016. By region, the U.S. 
economy  has  continued  to  recover  firmly,  mainly  in  household  spending,  owing  to 
improvement  in  the  employment  and  income  situation.  The  real  GDP  registered  relatively 
high growth of 3 percent on an annualized quarter-on-quarter basis for the last two quarters, 
suggesting that the major hurricanes that hit the southern United States in summer only had 
short-term effects. As for the European economy, although continued attention needs to be 
paid to negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU) and the 
European  debt  problem,  including  the  financial  sector,  the  uncertainties  surrounding  these 
factors  have  abated.  Under  such  circumstances,  the  European  economy  has  continued  to 
recover steadily, and the divergence in growth rates among the euro area economies clearly 
has become smaller recently. Emerging and commodity-exporting economies have followed 
their recovery trends. Specifically, the Chinese economy has continued to see stable growth 
on the whole, partly due to the effects of authorities' measures to support economic activity; 
 1 
commodity-exporting  economies  such  as  Brazil  and  Russia  --  which  had  been  stagnant  -- 
have picked up, particularly reflecting the bottoming out of commodity prices and monetary 
easing effects. At the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) Annual Meeting  this October, 
which  I  participated  in,  IMF  Managing  Director  Christine  Lagarde  assessed  the  recent 
global economy as showing "the broadest-based recovery in the last 10 years." 
 With  regard  to  the  outlook  for  the  global  economy,  both  the  advanced  and  emerging 
economies are projected to  continue growing in a well-balanced manner. According to the 
latest  World  Economic  Outlook  (WEO)  released  by  the  IMF,  the  global  economy  is 
expected to maintain its firm growth, with the annual real GDP growth rate registering 3.2 
percent in 2016, 3.6 percent in 2017, and 3.7 percent in 2018 (Chart 1). 
 The Current Situation of Japan's Economic Activity and Its Outlook 
Next, I will talk about Japan's economy. It has continued to grow in a well-balanced manner, 
similar to the case I just mentioned for the global economy. Japan's economy is expanding 
moderately, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating. The real GDP growth 
rate  for  the  July-September  quarter  was  1.4  percent  on  an  annualized  basis,  representing 
positive growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. This was observed for the first time in 
16 years, since 2001. The output gap that shows the utilization of capital and labor exceeded 
the long-term average of 0 percent in the second half of 2016, and has widened further in 
positive territory recently (Chart 2). 
 This is the third time in the past 20 years that Japan's output gap turned positive. The past 
two  cases  occurred  during  the  so-called  dot-com  bubble period  in  the early  2000s  and the 
global  credit  bubble  period  from  2006  through  2008.  Both  of  these  recovery  phases 
depended on external demand. By contrast, in the current recovery phase, both the external 
and  domestic  demand  are  strong  drivers  for  Japan's  economic  growth.  As  for  external 
demand, Japan's exports have increased -- mainly led by IT-related goods exported to Asia 
-- on the back of the growth in overseas economies. In addition, domestic demand has been 
on  an  increasing  trend.  Specifically,  business  fixed  investment  has  been  on  a  moderate 
increasing trend, while corporate profits have improved, marking record high levels (Chart 
3).  Private  consumption  has  increased  its  resilience,  supported  by  steady  improvement  in 
 2 
the  employment  and  income  situation  as  well  as  replacement  demand  for  durable  goods. 
Public investment also has been increasing due to the implementation of  the government's 
stimulus measures formulated in fiscal 2016. As these developments show, Japan's current 
economy  is  supported  by  multiple  factors  --  namely,  external  demand,  domestic  private 
demand,  and  domestic  public  demand  --  in  a  well-balanced  manner.  For  this  reason,  it  is 
possible to assess the economy as having resilience to exogenous shocks. 
 Another notable feature of Japan's economy recently is that the effects of its expansion have 
been spreading to a wide range of economic entities. The diffusion index (DI) for business 
conditions  in  the  Tankan  (Short-Term  Economic  Survey  of  Enterprises  in  Japan)  has 
continued  to be positive,  not  only  in  large  enterprises  and  manufacturers  but also  in  small 
enterprises and nonmanufacturers. This is clearly different from the recovery phases in the 
early  and  mid-2000s,  which  were  led  by  external  demand  (Chart  4).  Looking  at 
developments by region, the DI has been positive for all regions since the December 2013 
survey.  Labor  market  conditions  have  tightened  nationwide,  as  seen  in  the  active  job 
openings-to-applicants ratios in many regions having risen to levels comparable to those in 
major metropolitan areas (Chart 5). 
 Let  me  turn  to  the  economic  outlook.  Going  forward,  Japan's  economy  is  expected  to 
continue expanding moderately. The Bank makes projections for Japan's economic activity 
and  releases  them  quarterly  in  the  Outlook  for  Economic  Activity  and  Prices  (Outlook 
Report);  in  the  latest  Outlook  Report  released  at  end-October,  the  medians  of  the  Policy 
Board  members'  forecasts  of  the  real  GDP  growth  rates  for  fiscal  2017  and  2018  are  1.9 
percent and 1.4 percent, respectively. These figures are above Japan's potential growth rate, 
which is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. In fiscal 2019, although the growth 
pace  is  projected  to  decelerate,  the  economy  is  expected  to  continue  expanding, 
underpinned  by  the  increase  in  exports  on  the  back  of  the  growth  in  overseas  economies, 
and the median of the forecasts of the real GDP growth rate is 0.7 percent. 
 The  economic  activity  could,  of  course,  deviate  either  upward  or  downward  from  these 
projections. The biggest risk factor is developments in overseas economies. As I mentioned 
earlier, the baseline scenario is that overseas economies are expected to continue growing at 
 3 
a  moderate  pace,  and  it  is  no  longer  the  case  that  risks  are  likely  to  be  skewed  to  the 
downside. That being said, the U.S. economic policies and their impact on global financial 
markets  warrant  attention,  and  geopolitical  risks  also  could  exert  downward  pressure  on 
economic  activity.  The  Bank  will  continue  to  pay  close  attention  to  both  upside  and 
downside risks. 
 II. Price Developments and Their Outlook 
Price Developments 
Now, I will move on to price developments. Prices in Japan have been increasing gradually, 
mainly  on  the  back  of  a  rise  in  energy  prices.  The  year-on-year  rate  of  increase  in  the 
consumer price index (CPI) excluding fresh food has accelerated to 0.8 percent this October, 
rising  by  more  than  1  percentage  point  in  a  year  from  the  rate  of  change  of  minus  0.4 
percent  registered  in  October  last  year  (Chart  6).  Excluding  the  effects  of  energy  prices, 
however,  the  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI  has  remained  slightly  positive.  Thus,  price 
developments in Japan are still relatively weak despite continuing economic expansion and 
the tightened labor market conditions. 
 Somewhat  strong  economic  activity  and  relatively  weak  prices,  which  seem  contrary  to 
each  other  at  first  glance,  are  coexisting  in  Japan.  This  situation  is  also  observed  in  other 
advanced economies recently. The inflation rates in the United States and the euro area have 
remained below the central banks' target  levels despite the firm improvement in the global 
economy that I mentioned at the outset. 
 Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen described the recent sluggish price developments in the 
United States as a "mystery," while referring to the possibility that  such developments are 
mainly due to transitory factors such as a decline in telecommunication service prices. The 
chair  pointed  out  that  the  outlook  is  subject  to  considerable  uncertainty  from  multiple 
sources. Specifically, in addition to uncertainties regarding the supply capacity in the labor 
market and medium- to long-term inflation expectations, the chair mentioned the possibility 
that  factors  such  as 
increasing  competition  with  emerging  economies,  reflecting 
globalization,  and  a  rapid  spread  of  the  use  of  online  shopping  backed  by  advances  in 
technology could affect price developments. It  may be very beneficial for Japan as well to 
 4 
consider  these  points  when  analyzing  its  price  developments.  However,  it  also  should  be 
kept  in  mind  that  the  inflation  rates  in  the  United  States  and  the  euro  area  have  been  at 
around  1.5  percent  despite  being  regarded  as  somewhat  weak,  and  that  such  situation  is 
somewhat different from that in Japan. Therefore, it is natural to think that low inflation in 
Japan also is attributable to factors that are unique to Japan. 
 The Background to Relatively Weak Price Developments and Their Outlook 
I will elaborate on the relationship  between economic activity and prices in Japan. Taking 
into  account  that  firms'  wage-  and  price-setting  stance  exerts  a  large  impact  on  prices, 
weakness in price developments in Japan can be explained by the following two steps. 
 The  first  is  a  moderate  improvement  in  wages  despite  the  tightness  in  labor  market 
conditions.  In  particular,  it  is  noticeable  that  wage  increases  for  full-time  employees  are 
sluggish,  compared  to  those  for  part-time  employees  (Chart  7).  Since  scheduled  cash 
earnings of full-time employees account for almost 70 percent of the total employee income, 
their  impact  is  not  small.  On  this  issue,  some  point  to  the  fact  that,  since  both  labor  and 
management  in  Japan  place  priority  on  the  long-term  stability  of  employment  and  wages 
over  wage  increases,  the  following  has  been  observed:  employment  adjustment  and  wage 
reductions  of  full-time  employees  had  been  conducted  only  marginally  in  an  economic 
downturn, and wages barely rise even if the economy recovers and labor market conditions 
tighten.  It  also  can  be  said  that  past  downward  rigidity  in  wages  has  led  to  the  present 
upward rigidity. 
 The second is that, even though wage increases have been taking place, albeit at a moderate 
pace, the pass-through of wage costs to sales prices has not been observed yet widely. This 
reflects  firms'  efforts  to  absorb  increased  wage  costs  through,  for  example,  labor-saving 
investment  that  makes  use  of  information  technology,  as  evident  in  software  investment 
increasing remarkably of  late in industries where labor shortage is particularly acute, such 
as restaurants, retail, and construction (Chart 8). While these efforts are based on individual 
firms'  reasonable  business  strategy  with  a  view  to  raising  productivity,  they  would  reduce 
the upward pressure on prices in the economy as a whole. 
  5 
However, I believe that this situation is changing gradually. 
 First of all, we will see a change in wages. Given that the labor market conditions have been 
so tight, it is no wonder that this leads to an increase in wages for  full-time employees.  It 
also is an important fact that a base pay rise, which  did not take place under deflation, has 
continued for four consecutive years since 2014. In order to create a virtuous cycle between 
a moderate rise in prices and increases in corporate profits and income, it should be widely 
recognized  in  society  that  wages  rise  continuously  under  a  sound  economy.  The  Bank 
expects that efforts by both labor and management to realize the virtuous cycle will become 
widespread  by  taking  advantage  of  tailwinds  of  the  current  favorable  economic 
environment. 
 In  addition,  firms'  stance  is  likely  to  gradually  shift  toward  raising  prices.  With  hourly 
scheduled  cash  earnings  of  part-time  employees  remaining  on  an  uptrend,  the  upward 
pressure of the rise in firms' costs on prices has been increasing, supported also by a rise in 
input prices due to the past depreciation of the yen. It seems that consumers are gradually 
accepting  price  rises  on  the  back  of  the  employment  and  income  situation  having  been 
improving. 
 Although,  for  the  time  being,  it  is  likely  that  some  firms  will  decide  on  a price  rise  while 
others  will  remain  hesitant,  firms'  bullish  stance  to  raise  prices  is  expected  to  become 
predominant eventually.  However, it is not easy to clearly point to the timing  of when this 
will  happen  beforehand,  because  the  specific  timing  at  which  each  firm's  stance  shifts 
toward raising prices is likely to vary, depending on developments in demand that each firm 
and industry faces, or on the cost structure. The CPI, which reflects these developments, is 
likely to increase moderately going forward. 
 III. QQE and Its Effects 
Basic Mechanism of Monetary Easing 
So  far,  I  have  explained  developments  in  Japan's  economic  activity  and  prices.  In  what 
follows, I will talk about the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. 
  6 
In  textbook  theory,  the  basic  mechanism  of  monetary  policy  is  to  stimulate  or  contain 
economic  activity  by  driving  the  actual  real  interest  rates  to  levels  below  or  above  the 
natural rate of interest, which I will explain shortly. Real interest rates are rates adjusted to 
exclude  future  price  fluctuations  by  subtracting  inflation  expectations  from  the  nominal 
interest rates that we usually come across. The natural rate of interest is the real interest rate 
at  which  the  economy  neither  accelerates  nor  decelerates,  and  is  likely  to  be  close  to  the 
potential growth rate under normal conditions. The lower the actual real interest rates than 
the natural rate of interest, the greater the level of monetary accommodation. The economic 
growth  will  accelerate  as  low  interest  rates  stimulate  economic  activities  such  as  business 
fixed  investment,  leading  to  an  improvement  in  the  output  gap.  This  improvement  will 
finally bring about a rise in the inflation rate. 
 QQE,  which  the  Bank  introduced  in  April  2013,  aims  to  substantially  lower  Japan's  real 
interest rates in order to overcome deflation that  lasted for the past 15 years. In September 
last  year,  the  Bank  introduced  a  new  framework  --  "QQE  with  Yield  Curve  Control"  -- 
thereby further strengthening monetary easing. This framework consists of two components 
that aim at lowering real interest rates (Chart 9). 
 The  first  is  an  inflation-overshooting  commitment.  This  is  a  strong  commitment  that  the 
Bank will continue expanding the monetary base until the  year-on-year rate of increase in 
the  actual  CPI  exceeds  2  percent  and  stays  above  that  level  in  a  stable  manner.  It  aims  to 
raise people's inflation expectations in a more forceful manner. 
 The second component is yield curve control. The Bank conducts  large-scale purchases of 
Japanese  government  bonds  (JGBs)  to  facilitate  the  formation  of  the  yield  curve  that  is 
considered  most  appropriate  for  achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent  at  the 
earliest possible time. Specifically, in the guideline for market operations, the Bank sets the 
short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the  target level of the 10-year JGB 
yields at around zero percent, and the observed yield curve has been formed smoothly in a 
manner  consistent  with  this  guideline.  If  the  Bank  maintains  nominal  interest  rates  at 
sufficiently low levels through yield curve control and raises people's inflation expectations 
 7 
through  the  inflation-overshooting  commitment,  real  interest  rates  --  calculated  by 
subtracting inflation expectations from nominal interest rates -- will decline significantly. 
 Yield Curve Control 
Now,  I  would  like  to  provide  a  little  more  explanation  concerning  the  second  component, 
yield curve control. 
 Before introducing this framework in September last year, the Bank set a quantitative target 
-- increasing the outstanding amount of JGBs held by  the Bank at an annual pace of about 
80 trillion yen -- and was purchasing JGBs in line with the target. There are commonalities 
and differences between the previous approach and the current yield curve control approach. 
First,  these  two approaches  are  the  same  in  terms of  the  basic  transmission mechanism  of 
monetary  easing:  lowering  nominal  interest  rates  through  large-scale  JGB  purchases  and 
thereby reducing real interest rates. However, under the previous approach, which fixed the 
purchase  amount of  JGBs  at a  certain  level,  the  level  of  interest  rates  could decline  either 
excessively or insufficiently, reflecting the economic and price developments as well as the 
conditions  in  the  JGB  market.  As  a  result,  the  yield  curve  could  deviate  either  upward  or 
downward from the one that the Bank deemed appropriate. This problem does not arise in 
principle  under  the  current  yield  curve  control  because  it  sets  the  short-  and  long-term 
interest rates themselves as operating targets. Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, the yield curve 
in  Japan  has  been  formed  smoothly  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  guideline  for  market 
operations in the past one year. 
 There are several points to make in conducting yield curve control. 
 The first point is how to determine the most appropriate shape of the yield curve to achieve 
the price stability target of 2 percent. Under conventional monetary policy, determining one 
optimal  short-term  policy  interest  rate  --  the  uncollateralized  overnight  call  rate,  for 
example  --  was  sufficient  in  conducting  monetary  policy.  However,  under  the  current 
framework, we naturally must extend the scope to the entire yield curve. It is necessary to 
analyze the status of inflation expectations and the natural rate of interest for each maturity 
and find the shape of the yield curve that produces the  most appropriate level of monetary 
 8 
accommodation.  Although  this  process  involves  difficult  analysis  in  practice,  the  basic 
concept  is  clear.  As  we  explained  in  the  Comprehensive  Assessment,  in  order  to  form  an 
appropriate yield curve, the Bank makes decisions in consideration of the possible spillover 
effects  on  bank  lending  rates  and  issuance  rates  for  corporate  bonds,  the  impact  on  the 
economy,  and  the  impact  on  the  functioning  of  financial  intermediation,  among  other 
factors. The Bank has maintained this stance ever since introducing  yield curve control in 
September last year. 
 The second point is the sustainability of yield curve control. I am aware of concerns among 
some market participants that, as the Bank continues to purchase JGBs on such a large scale, 
the supply of JGBs circulating in the market may dry up sooner or later, making it difficult 
to control the long-term interest rate. 
 In this respect, the Bank's JGB purchases have been conducted in a smooth manner thus far 
and the Bank expects that the risk of having a problem in terms of continuing with its JGB 
purchases will be small for the time being. 
 Of  course,  controlling  the  long-term  interest  rate  itself  is  a  challenging  initiative  that  is 
unprecedented  in  global  terms.  To  keep  the  long-term  interest  rate  under  control,  it  is 
necessary  to  have  a  firm  understanding  of  what  factors  affect  the  interest  rate  for  each 
maturity. Analysis on this point has been conducted not only by the Bank of Japan but also 
by  the  Federal  Reserve  and  the  European  Central  Bank  (ECB),  which  have  also 
implemented large-scale asset purchase programs. Although there are various approaches to 
analyzing what factor affects the long-term interest rate, the prevailing view appears to be 
that  what  has  a  strong  impact  in  the  long  run  is  not  the  purchase  amount  of  government 
bonds  by  a  central  bank  in  each  market  operation  on  a  flow  basis.  Rather,  the  long-term 
interest  rate  is  largely  influenced  by  the  amount  outstanding  of  government  bonds 
purchased  by  the  central  bank  on  a  stock  basis,  which  represents  the  cumulative  net 
purchase amount of government bonds, or the ratio of the amount outstanding of the central 
bank's holdings of government bonds to the overall amount issued. The Bank assesses that 
the  main  reason  it  has  been  able  to  maintain  the  10-year  JGB  yields  at  around  0  percent 
since the introduction of yield curve control is stock effects  -- or the cumulative effects of 
 9 
JGB purchases that have continued since before its introduction -- which have been working 
well. 
 With  stock  effects  working  firmly,  if  the  supply-demand  conditions  in  the  JGB  market 
tighten in the future, the impact of a unit amount of the Bank's JGB purchases on long-term 
yields accordingly should become more significant, with all else being equal. Put differently, 
the Bank can have the same degree of effect in lowering interest rates with a smaller amount 
of  JGB  purchases.  Therefore,  I  would  like  to  reemphasize  that  yield  curve  control  is 
designed to be highly sustainable. 
 Accommodative Financial Conditions 
Lastly, I will discuss the actual effects of the Bank's monetary easing measures on Japan's 
economy.  Through  the  introduction  of  QQE,  the  Bank  has  succeeded  in  lowering  Japan's 
real  interest  rates  well  below  the  potential  growth  rate  by  conducting  large-scale  JGB 
purchases and raising inflation expectations (Chart 10). This was the first such achievement 
to be made in the fight against prolonged deflation since the end of the 1990s. 
 As  a  consequence,  the  economic  activities  of  firms  and  households  have  been  activated, 
leading  to  a  steady  improvement  in  the  output  gap.  According  to  the  government,  the 
current recovery phase, which started in December 2012, is highly likely to have lasted for 
58  consecutive  months  by  September  this  year.  The  duration  of  the  current  recovery  has 
thus  surpassed  that  of  the  Izanagi  Boom  in  the  second  half  of  the  1960s.  In  light  of  this 
situation, coupled with the fact that the period of the current recovery mostly overlaps the 
period  of  QQE,  it  appears  that  this  policy  has  contributed  to  the  long-lasting  recovery, 
which is the second longest in the post-war era. On the price front, too, annual CPI inflation 
excluding  fresh  food  and  energy  has  been  positive  as  a  trend  for  about  four  years.  Under 
QQE,  Japan  is  no  longer in  deflation,  which  is  generally  defined  as  a  sustained  decline  in 
prices. 
 It  seems  that  the  monetary  easing  has  exerted  positive  effects  on  individual  firms  in  the 
form of improvement in  funding conditions. In line with the decline in JGB yields, which 
are the  base  interest rates,  firms' funding  costs  --  namely,  bank  lending  rates  and  issuance 
 10 
rates for CP and corporate bonds -- have declined firmly. For example, bank lending rates 
on new loans recently have been around historical low levels, in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. 
The real bank lending rates -- the nominal bank lending rates minus the inflation rates -- on 
new  loans  have  declined to  around 0  percent  (Chart  11).  In  other  words,  the  average  firm 
can borrow new loans with hardly any interest payment if the inflation rates are taken into 
consideration. Also, with respect to the availability of funds, many firms have the growing 
sense that financial conditions have become highly accommodative. From the viewpoint of 
either large or small enterprises, the lending attitudes of financial institutions have become 
very proactive. In terms of the DI in the Bank's Tankan for lending attitudes, that for small 
enterprises in particular has been at a high level last seen at the end of the 1980s (Chart 12). 
The  Bank  will  continue  to  provide  maximum  support  for  corporate  activities  in  Japan  by 
maintaining such accommodative financial conditions. 
 Conclusion 
Today,  I  have  explained  the  recent  economic  and  price  developments  and  the  Bank's 
thinking behind the conduct of monetary policy that takes account of such developments. 
 Although it is true that there is still a long way to go to achieve the price stability target of 2 
percent, it is clear from the results so far achieved that QQE has been effective in drastically 
improving  Japan's  economy.  Going  forward,  in  line  with  the  steady  improvement  in  the 
economy,  firms'  stance  is  likely  to  gradually  shift  toward  raising  wages  and  prices. 
Moreover,  people's  medium-  to  long-term  inflation  expectations  are  projected  to  rise 
steadily  as  further  price  rises  come  to  be  observed  widely.  In  order  to  ensure  that  such 
positive  developments  will  be  long-lasting  and  that  Japan's  economy  will  become  a 
well-balanced  one  in  which  economic  improvement  and  price  stability  are  simultaneously 
achieved, the Bank will continue to persistently pursue powerful monetary easing under the 
current framework of "QQE with Yield Curve Control"  with a view to achieving the price 
stability target of 2 percent. 
 Thank you very much for your attention.
