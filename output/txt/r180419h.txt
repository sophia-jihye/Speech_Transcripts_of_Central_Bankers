Ladies and Gentlemen 
In his speech, my colleague Dewet Moser has demonstrated how being open to innovations 
can pay off. However, he also underscores the point that it is entirely appropriate to carefully 
examine their purpose and the benefits they offer. I would now like to apply this scrutiny to 
the fintech innovations that are currently attracting a great deal of attention among the general 
public and in the financial industry. 
Bitcoin is one of the most talked-about topics at present, and the hype that has built up around 
cryptocurrencies in general is considerable. It is estimated that well over 1,000 of these 
currencies are in circulation today. If you search the internet for the word ‘bitcoin’ you will 
find more than 300 million entries. By contrast, the term ‘Swiss franc’ generates just over 30 
million hits. Furthermore, bitcoin has a very modest market capitalisation by comparison with 
conventional currencies and investments, as we can see in the left-hand chart on the slide 1. 
This highlights the marked difference between the level of public interest and the actual use of 
cryptocurrencies.  
Alternative private currencies are nothing new. We need only think of WIR money, or 
regional currencies in French-speaking Switzerland such as the léman and farinet. In the 
digital era, such currencies can be created more or less at the click of a mouse. Despite their 
name, however, cryptocurrencies are not comparable with money – far from it. Money has to 
fulfil several fundamental functions. It should serve as a viable medium of exchange in the 
economy, that is to say it must be widely accepted as a means of payment. It also has to be a 
stable unit of account for the value of the goods and services that are exchanged. And it 
should also be used as a long-term store of value, for example for saving. Cryptocurrencies 
such as the much-discussed bitcoin do not perform these functions adequately, if at all.  
Trust is the very essence of a stable currency. This trust cannot evolve without a solid 
framework, including a state governed by the rule of law, a sustainable economic and fiscal 
policy, and also an independent central bank. Cryptocurrencies that have no link to a 
conventional currency (the Swiss franc for instance) display a high level of price volatility. 
They are more of a speculative investment instrument than a means of payment capable of 
retaining its value. The chart on the right-hand side of the slide illustrates this. Compared with 
exchange rates, commodities and equities, cryptocurrencies are subject to very high volatility, 
and investors must be aware of the financial risks they are taking on when buying them.  
Cryptocurrencies therefore do not meet the requirements of a currency. However, this does 
not mean we can simply dismiss them out of hand, for behind all of the hype there is an array 
of technological innovations. Particularly important among these is the distributed ledger 
technology, known as DLT for short and often also referred to as blockchain. In other words: 
it is important to make a clear distinction between cryptocurrencies as assets, and the 
underlying technology, which does indeed have potential.   
DLT could facilitate solutions in various areas of the economy that would enhance the safety 
  Page 2/8 
     and efficiency of digital information flows. A distributed ledger is essentially a decentralised 
and synchronised database that allows participants to read, write and save information. DLT 
makes it possible to unequivocally define ownership structures within a computer network, 
without the need for a central third party. These facets also give rise to interesting possibilities 
for the financial sector, and DLT is therefore regarded as one of the biggest innovations in the 
fintech area.  
Today I would like to look at the effect fintech innovations could have on a key element of 
the financial system, namely the financial market infrastructure. The financial market 
infrastructure, FMI for short, comprises trading platforms, securities settlement systems and 
payment systems via which financial transactions are conducted electronically. The FMI is 
generally not in the spotlight. Nevertheless, both the financial sector and the Swiss economy 
as a whole depend on a secure and efficient FMI. The SNB monitors developments in this 
area very closely given that facilitating and securing the operation of cashless payment 
systems is one of its statutory tasks.  
In this speech I will be discussing the significance of fintech for the financial market 
infrastructure. First, I will address DLT’s potential in the FMI. Second, I will be talking about 
the tried-and-tested division of roles between the central bank and commercial banks. I will 
look at how this two-tier system paves the way for harnessing fintech innovations that could 
enhance efficiency, while ensuring that this is not to the detriment of either safety or 
reliability. Third, using the example of retail payments, I will show that there is a lot more to 
fintech than just DLT, and that private sector players are much better suited to providing 
timely solutions and flexibly addressing the needs of customers in this area. And finally, I will 
take a brief look at digital central bank money for the general public, a subject currently 
generating a lot of debate, and will outline why there is no need for it if the system for 
cashless retail payments is efficient and innovative. 
The potential of DLT for the FMI 
So let me begin with the potential that DLT has to offer for the FMI. The FMI is the bedrock 
of our financial system, facilitating the reliable transfer of securities and money between 
buyers and sellers.  
The slide 2 shows a simplified FMI process chain for the settlement of a securities 
transaction. Transactions are first made via a trading platform, for instance a security is 
bought on the Swiss Exchange. This purchase is then cleared and settled. Security and money 
are simultaneously transferred between buyer and seller. In Switzerland, this takes place via 
the securities settlement system SECOM and the payment system Swiss Interbank Clearing, 
or SIC for short.  
It is entirely possible that distributed ledger technology could take hold in various fields. I 
would like to look here at two possible areas of application: securities settlement and cross-
border payments.  
  Page 3/8 
     One of DLT’s key characteristics is that it makes verified information available to a large 
number of parties simultaneously. It is therefore particularly appealing in the case of complex 
processes where coordination is required across a whole range of participants. This is the case 
in the securities business, which comprises a network of many different participants trading, 
settling and managing securities. Examples of these market participants – brokers, banks, 
settlement service providers and custodians – are shown on the slide 3. With every 
transaction, a wide array of booking information has to be reconciled bilaterally between the 
parties involved (slide 4). For example, banks have to reconcile and monitor their securities 
holdings at custodians against their own internal accounts. The coordination requires 
considerable effort, which in turn leads to high operating costs. DLT could help in this regard 
by ensuring that all of the involved parties have the same information at the same time. The 
slide 5 illustrates this step. Thanks to the synchronised distribution of information, the 
aforementioned, highly complex reconciliation would no longer be necessary. 
The potential for efficiency gains is indeed considerable, which is why extensive research is 
now being conducted in this area. And innovations that enhance the efficiency of the financial 
system or the economy as a whole are certainly worthy of closer inspection. The Australian 
Securities Exchange ASX, for example, has recently announced that it is to use DLT in 
redeveloping its core system for clearing and settling of equity transactions and recording 
shareholdings.  
In addition to the securities business, potential uses of DLT are also being envisaged in the 
field of cross-border payments. The latter are slow, costly and lacking in transparency 
compared with domestic payment transactions, and so the potential for efficiency gains is 
particularly high. Certain central banks – those of Singapore and Hong Kong, for example – 
are now focusing on this, as are private initiatives. Should the anticipated advantages 
materialise, the attendant efficiency gains would be substantial. That said, for both of these 
potential applications there are high barriers that have to be overcome in order for new 
solutions to be implemented in practice and find their place in the market. The current 
ecosystem comprises a large number of stakeholders, who would have to adapt their systems 
and processes. The high level of investment this entails is curbing the pace of developments, 
as are the technical and legal questions still to be resolved.  
Tried-and-tested division of roles between banks and central banks 
What is the SNB’s take on these developments? We welcome innovations that enhance the 
efficiency of processes. But while the initial experiments have been promising, there is still a 
long way to go before market-ready DLT solutions become a reality in the FMI. DLT has still 
to prove that the hoped-for efficiency gains can actually be delivered in practice. Furthermore, 
simply enhancing efficiency alone is not enough. Such gains must not come at the expense of 
the availability and resilience of the systems or the integrity of the data. This applies 
especially to those parts of the FMI that are systemically important. Here we set the highest of 
standards when it comes to stability and security. 
  Page 4/8 
     The secure settlement of large-value payments is a prerequisite for the stability of the 
financial system. Financial transactions, which as a rule involve substantial amounts and are 
time-critical, are of great significance for the real economy. This is why it is so important to 
have the settlement of large-value payments as a reliable foundation.  
To avoid risks with regard to payments in this systemically important segment, there needs to 
be a risk-free payment instrument. Today, time-critical, large-value payments in a currency 
area are therefore usually settled in central bank money and via central banks’ payment 
systems, referred to as real-time gross settlement systems or RTGS for short. Switzerland’s 
RTGS system is Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC). An RTGS system ensures that payments are 
made when – and only when – there is sufficient money on the account of the paying bank. If 
there are adequate funds to cover the payments, they are settled irrevocably and in real time. 
This assures the safety of the settlement process. Using central bank money also eliminates 
the risk of default by the settlement institution. Central banks can provide additional liquidity 
if required at any time, and also serve as the lender of last resort. In this way, they ensure that 
there is a reliable foundation for the FMI. This has proved effective to date, and also stood up 
well during the financial crisis. 
Could DLT also be used in RTGS systems in the future, i.e. as part of the reliable foundation? 
We see a number of questions that are still to be resolved here. The technology itself does not 
yet meet the requirements expected of the RTGS systems in terms of scalability, data security 
and reliability. Modern RTGS systems such as SIC are already demonstrably efficient and 
crisis-resilient. In this area, a payment system not only has to prove its efficiency; the 
reliability of the RTGS systems is also absolutely crucial for the stability of the financial 
system. New technologies therefore have to meet very high standards in this respect. 
However, it is quite possible that DLT may take hold in other areas. If DLT were to become 
established in the securities business, for example, these systems would be linked to the 
reliable foundation in some manner or other. It is hard to envisage DLT-based system 
environments developing in isolation.  
So the next question is what form the coexistence of new DLT solutions and conventional 
RTGS systems might take. There are different scenarios. One possibility would be a simple 
technical interface between the DLT system and the existing RTGS system, as illustrated on 
the slide 6. Payment instructions would be exchanged via this interface, in much the same 
way as the current solution between SECOM and SIC. However, direct delivery-versus-
payment settlement would require certain adjustments, for example to the opening times and 
participant structure of both systems.  
A second and more far-reaching possibility would be to integrate the cash leg into the DLT-
based infrastructure. This could be achieved by having the private operators of this 
infrastructure issue a ‘settlement token’ on the DLT system, with the securities then being 
settled against these tokens. An initiative launched by a consortium with Swiss participation is 
working on such an approach under the project name ‘Utility Settlement Coin’. This example 
shows how a market solution could ensure cash-side settlement of securities on the distributed 
  Page 5/8 
     ledger. This scenario is outlined on the slide 7. Such a privately issued settlement token 
would be equivalent to commercial bank money, and fully secured by central bank money. 
However, it would also be possible in principle for central bank money to be tokenised for the 
settlement of interbank transactions. Central banks in some countries – Singapore among 
them – are conducting experiments to gain a better understanding of the associated risks. As 
you can see on the slide 8, this is similar in concept to the previous option. However, there are 
a number of questions still to be answered in this respect as well. 
As you can see, there would be various forms that this coexistence could take. What is crucial 
is that the safety and reliability of the FMI be maintained. The central bank has an important 
part to play in the reliable foundation, that is to say with regard to payments in the RTGS 
system. Around this solid foundation, however, it is the market that has the main role. Here it 
is the commercial banks and other private sector stakeholders that choose the best 
technologies and solutions. 
The division of roles between central banks and commercial banks results in a good balance 
between safety and efficiency. At the first level, the central banks facilitate the settlement of 
interbank transactions on secure systems and in electronic central bank money. In so doing, 
they minimise the risks in the systemically important segment of payment transactions, 
beyond which the risks can be borne by the market. At this second level, settlement can take 
place via alternative channels, without necessarily having to be based on central bank money. 
This division of roles between central banks and commercial banks epitomises our current 
two-tier financial system. In the first tier, the central bank acts as the banker to the banks. In 
the second tier, the commercial banks act as the interface to the end customers. And it is the 
competing commercial banks that decide which services they want to provide for companies 
and private individuals. This system is efficient and proven.  
There is much more to fintech than just DLT 
In connection with fintech, I have so far focused mainly on DLT. However, there is of course 
much more to fintech than just DLT. In addition to DLT, a whole array of promising 
innovations could potentially be applied to traditional financial services. We need only think 
of mobile payments, robo advisers, crowd lending or big data. The multifaceted interplay of 
ever greater processing power and storage capacity, together with the increase in the mobile 
use of services, are opening up entirely new business areas. This is also reflected in the large 
number of different business models currently represented in the Swiss fintech industry. The 
slide 9 shows the different business models in Switzerland. Only 15% of the enterprises 
within this segment are focusing on DLT, while the remainder are spread across other fields 
of application. 
One of the key areas for fintech is retail payments, i.e. payment transactions for companies 
and private individuals. A well-functioning system of payment transactions for end customers 
is a key pillar in any efficient economy. This payments area is undergoing a period of rapid 
technological change. 
  Page 6/8 
     As with all fintech innovations, the primary focus is on the user-friendliness and speed of the 
services offered. Technological advances have led to marked changes in consumer 
expectations and requirements. Consumers want payment services to be ever faster and more 
user-friendly, and they want to be able to use them wherever they may be. End consumers 
these days are asking why it should take them longer to make a cashless payment than to send 
a WhatsApp message. As elsewhere, customers expect immediate service when it comes to 
payment transactions, and demand round-the-clock availability as well. 
To satisfy these demands, fintech companies and banks are working on new solutions, such as 
new applications, functionalities and services. Examples include linking the payment 
application to retailers’ customer programmes, or cross-institutional analysis and visualisation 
of end customers’ payment data. Experiments are being conducted in China on linking face 
recognition technology and payment transactions, opening up the possibility of making 
payments in the future by smiling into the seller’s camera. In this process of innovation, it is 
of course essential that the key questions relating to aspects such as misuse or criminal usage 
as well as the protection of customers are addressed effectively and coordinated 
internationally. It is therefore important that the same business models with the same risks be 
subject to the same regulation. 
As part of its statutory mandate, the SNB also has a role to play when it comes to innovations 
in the field of cashless payments. Specifically, it is the commissioning party and system 
manager of SIC. At infrastructure level, the latter’s function is to offer the most attractive 
framework possible for a cashless payment system that is fast and ensures high availability. 
The SNB works together with stakeholders on the ongoing development of the SIC system. 
One year ago, for example, the operating hours of this system were adjusted at the request of 
the participants. 
However, end customers’ needs in respect of payment transactions are best met by private 
sector solutions. Here, too, the advantages of the two-tier system come into play. The slide 10 
illustrates the point, taking payment transactions as an example. As I explained earlier, the 
SNB as the bankers’ bank ensures that there is a reliable foundation for the settlement of 
payments. In the retail payments space, financial services providers use this as a platform for 
delivering their services to customers, doing so in competition with one another. Operating on 
these two levels, this system ensures that the financial sector remains agile and safe, and that 
the best ideas can thus take hold in the market without this compromising the systemically 
important segment.  
Digital central bank money – few advantages, significant risks 
Ladies and Gentlemen, before I sum up I would like to say a few words on the subject of 
digital central bank money for the general public. A more prominent role for central banks in 
the end customer segment is currently being discussed, involving this and other associated 
terms such as ‘cryptofranc’ and ‘e-franc’. However, we are convinced that private sector 
solutions are better suited for meeting end customers’ needs in this area. Digital central bank 
  Page 7/8 
     money for the general public is not necessary to ensure an efficient system for cashless retail 
payments. It would deliver scarcely any advantages, but would give rise to incalculable risks 
with regard to financial stability by calling into question the tried-and-tested two-tier system. 
Instead of operating as the bankers’ bank as it does today, the SNB would be acting as a 
commercial bank for end customers. This would exacerbate the threat posed by bank runs in 
times of crisis. Moreover, Switzerland would be alone in adopting such a solution: no other 
central bank has implemented such a solution to date. 
This brings me to the end of my speech. Please allow me to briefly sum up the key points. 
Conclusion  
I hope I have been able to demonstrate clearly why cryptocurrencies are not genuine rivals to 
conventional currencies. That said, the underlying distributed ledger technology does indeed 
have potential, especially in complex areas such as securities settlement and cross-border 
payment transactions. Nevertheless, the technology still has to prove itself in practice.  
As well as being efficient, DLT-based solutions must not give rise to any systemic risks in the 
financial market infrastructure. In the systemically important segment of cashless interbank 
payments, the SNB plays an active role by providing a reliable foundation. Any future DLT-
based systems will have to be linked with the latter in some form or other. 
In turn, in the area of cashless retail payments, the private sector is better placed to address 
customers’ needs. The division of roles between the central bank (as the bankers’ bank) and 
commercial banks (as the interface to the end customers) has certainly proved its worth over 
the years. This brings me to an important conclusion: If cashless payment transactions are 
efficient and innovative, there is no need for digital central bank money. 
What is important is that we remain agile. Our existing set-up contributes to the stability of 
the financial system, while at the same time allowing sufficient leeway for innovation. This 
can be said of both the financial market infrastructure and the two-tier financial system as a 
whole. In safeguarding this stability, we should nonetheless remain open to new 
developments.  
The SNB will continue to keep a close watch on developments to ensure that we are always 
able to assess their potential impact on the financial system in good time. Flexible and safe 
solutions often evolve from cooperation between market participants, regulators and central 
banks. So let us shape the digital future together. 
Thank you for your attention.
