Mr.  President  of  the  Senate’s  Finance  Commission,  senator  Juan  Pablo  Letelier,  senators  members  of  this 
Committee, ladies, gentlemen,  
I am grateful for your invitation to present the vision of the Board of the Central Bank of Chile on the latest 
economic developments, their perspectives and implications for monetary policy. This vision is contained in detail 
in our Monetary Policy Report (the Report) of March 2018.  
First and foremost, let me introduce to you our new Board member Mr. Alberto Naudon, who became part of the 
Board only a few days back, after being unanimously recommended by this Committee and then his appointment 
approved, also unanimously, by the Senate.  
It is worth noting that this is the first time we present the Report under the new monetary policy scheme that we 
began this year and under which we have tied its release with the monetary policy meetings. With these changes, 
we  have  significantly  increased  the  information  we deliver, establishing  its  relationship  with monetary  policy 
decisions more clearly. The greater transparency required by this scheme makes it necessary for the dates of our 
Meetings and the subsequent publication of the Monetary Policy Report to be communicated to the market well 
in advance, so that there are no surprises in this regard. For the same reason, as was the case with this Report, 
the time span between the Report’s publication and this presentation has been a little longer. Please note that 
we see this delay as a one-time thing and we are willing to attend this Committee to present our Monetary Policy 
Reports with all the haste that you may require. We have used this opportunity to add some information that 
came after the Report’s cutoff date to this presentation, plus some issues that have come up in the days following 
its publication. Thus, we look forward to an exchange with the Committee as enriching as it can be. 
Now let me share with you the main conclusions and projections of our Report. First, it is important to stress that 
this Report clearly marks a turning point in the business cycle that translates into higher growth and lower risks 
to both activity and inflation. 
The National Accounts figures we published two weeks ago showed two important developments. On one hand, 
the economy was quite weak between late 2016 and early 2017. In retrospect, these figures are consistent with 
other recent indicators such as labor market fundamentals, which were some of the reasons why we lowered the 
monetary policy rate (MPR) by 100 basis points, thus significantly boosting the monetary impulse in the first half 
of 2017. On the other hand, they confirmed that the economy performed better in the second half of the year, 
accumulating  two  quarters  of  increasing  growth,  a  significant  recovery  of  investment  and  sustained  export 
growth. 
What is behind this economic improvement? Certainly, the substantial impulse from monetary policy has played 
a part. In addition, external financial conditions have been improving steadily over the past year and investment 
has recovered, all within a context of improved expectations.  
It should be noted that this growth in activity in the past few quarters obeys to a recovery within the dynamics of 
the business cycle. We anticipated these improvements in our projections quite some time ago (figure 1). The 
evolution of our forecasts shows that at least as far back as a year ago we estimated growth for 2018 significantly 
stronger than in 2017; this projection did not change much throughout 2017. Private growth expectations for 
these years, albeit with some lag, gradually aligned with our own. 
 1 
Overall, the upward correction to the 2018 growth forecast is important and responds to several factors. For one, 
the higher growth of the second half of 2017 gives a higher base for the beginning of the year. Also, there is a 
further  improvement  in  external  conditions,  as  reflected  in  stronger  growth of  Chile's  trading  partners  (3.7% 
average for 2017/2019 in this Report vs. 3.5% in December) and commodity prices that remain above projections 
(figure 2).  
Add  to  this  the  persistence  of  the  expansionary  impulse  from  monetary  policy,  as  can  be  seen  by  simple 
observation of the interest rates of consumer, commercial or mortgage loans, which are all at or very near their 
all-time lows. Moreover, different qualitative measures produced by the Bank, such as the Banking Credit Survey 
or the Business Perceptions Report, coincide in their favorable evaluation of the cost of credit, considering its low 
interest rate. Another way to measure the expansionary nature of monetary policy is to review how far or near 
the MPR is from its estimated neutral level, which we place between 4% and 4.5%. Therefore, a 2.5% MPR is 
clearly expansionary and, in our baseline scenario, we assume that we will come near the neutral level only by 
2020. Furthermore, beyond the comparison with market rates or their neutral levels, Chile's monetary policy rate 
is among the lowest when compared to its Latin American peers or with other commodity-exporting countries 
with a similar macroeconomic framework (figure 3). 
The better prospects for 2018 growth also rely on the recovery of non-mining investment, including construction 
and other works, whose decline seems to be ending after one and a half years, which combines with a moderate 
growth in consumption (figure 4). All this is backed by improved consumer and business confidence indicators, 
which becomes all the more evident when referring to expectations about the future. 
These factors are not necessarily independent of each other, so it is difficult to quantify the importance of each 
one precisely. The important thing is that taken together they set a more favorable outlook for activity in 2018 
and, possibly, in the years to come. Actually, in this Report we present our first growth forecast for the years 2019 
and 2020,1 which indicates that the economy should grow between 3.25% and 4.25% next year, and between 3% 
and 4% in 2020. With these projections, we estimate that the activity gap will progressively close until 2020. This 
considers that potential GDP growth, currently estimated between 2.5% and 3%, is approaching trend growth, 
which we estimate between 3% and 3.5% (figure 5). 
For the purposes of the inflation outlook, the somewhat faster closing of the activity gap will compensate in the 
medium term the downward pressure of inflation derived from the peso appreciation of recent months. At the 
end of March, the peso had fallen by 4.5% compared to its average value for the fourth quarter of 2017, which is 
equivalent to a drop of around CLP25 per dollar. This owes to several factors. Abroad, the main thing has been a 
global trend of depreciation of the dollar and a copper price persisting above US$3 per pound. The interest rate 
differential  between  Chile  and  the  US,  although  theoretically  important,  empirically  has  a  somewhat  smaller 
effect. There have also been domestic factors mainly that the Chilean economy has been improving both its actual 
and expected performance. Plus, some short-term elements, for example in January and February the exchange 
                                                           
1 As stated in a box in this Report, from now on, and with the purpose of enhancing the transparency the Board’s vision about 
the economy and the path of monetary policy, it has been decided to add a third year in the projections published on each 
opportunity. Thus, starting in March 2018, every Report will include the growth and inflation forecasts for the next three 
years: the current year and the next two. These forecasts will continue to be reported in two ways; the estimated variable in 
the baseline scenario. For inflation, it will remain a specific number, while for growth it will be a range, as it is now done for 
the present year and next. This change adds to those adopted in March 2016, when the Board decided to extend by one year 
the growth forecast for activity.

rate  decrease  coincided  with  carry  trade  operations,  foreign  flows  for  company  acquisitions,  pension  fund 
portfolio adjustments and the entry into the market of the funds from the issuance of public debt. All this has led 
the peso to appreciate more than other comparable currencies (figure 6). However, some of these factors have a 
transitory  impact,  with  rapid  trend  shifts  over  a  few  days,  making  it  difficult  to  establish  a  clear  direction. 
Therefore, the peso has been very volatile in recent quarters, with peaks of over CLP650 in December and lows of 
less than CLP590 in February. However, the most notorious movements in the exchange rate have originated in 
its fundamentals (figure 7). 
The recent appreciation of the peso is largely responsible for the lower inflation that will prevail in the short term.2 
In our Report’s baseline scenario, CPI inflation will be around 2% annually until early next year, returning to near 
3% by the end of 2019. Meanwhile, core inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index excluding Food and 
Energy (CPIEFE), will be close to 1.5% by the middle of this year. At the same time, we estimate that once these 
pressures ease and the effects of the narrowing activity gap are more notorious—it is expected to close faster 
than we thought before—inflation will converge to the policy target during next year (figure 8). 
In  this  context,  the  Board  will  maintain  the  current  monetary  impulse  until  inflation  shows  clear  signs  of 
converging towards the target. This translates into a similar trajectory to the one that can be deduced from the 
surveys, that is, an MPR hovering around its current levels for several more months, but that by the turn of 2019 
will  have  already  begun  a  gradual  normalization.  Such  normalization  is  likely  to  be  completed  beyond  the 
monetary policy horizon of 24 months (figure 9). 
These projections, as always, are subjected to various risks. On the external front, in terms of its impact on local 
activity, the risk balance is downwards biased. The main risk is the possibility of a sharp deterioration of global 
financial conditions facing emerging economies. A significant part comes from the US economy, which is currently 
near or above full employment and inflation pressures that could trigger a more forceful reaction from the Fed. 
Special  mention  deserves  the  fiscal  stimulus  package  recently  approved  by  the  US  Congress,  which  will  put 
pressure on an economy where, as I just pointed out, gaps are already tight.3 
It is worth stressing that the deterioration that this would cause in the global financial conditions could have 
particularly severe consequences for those emerging economies with weaker fiscal or financial positions or that 
are highly indebted. China's situation is worrisome, as there are still several imbalances in its markets yet to be 
                                                           
2/ This Report includes a box analyzing the magnitude of the pass-through coefficient of exchange rate variations to inflation, 
identifying the origin of the variation and establishing that its effects on inflation change depending on the type of shock 
faced. In particular, it reviews how the inflationary effects of exchange rate fluctuations change depending on where they 
originate,  e.g.  in  a  movement  of  the  global  value  of  the  dollar  as  opposed  to  an  idiosyncratic  shock  hitting  the  Chilean 
economy.  The analysis finds  that the inflationary impact  of exchange rate  movements associated  with deviations of the 
interest rate parity is stronger and more persistent than if stemming from changes in foreign inflation. Thus, the implications 
for monetary policy are obvious: not all exchange rate variations have the same inflationary consequences and, therefore, 
the policy rate response must factor in their origin.  
3/ This Report includes a box reviewing the possible impacts of the US fiscal measures. The conclusion is that, in the context 
of  an  economy  with  scarce  capacity  gaps  and  highly  indebted,  a  bigger  fiscal  impulse  will  result  in  higher  inflation  and 
macroeconomic  imbalances  that  will  call  for  adjustments  in  the  medium  term.  This  makes  the  monetary-fiscal  policy 
interaction in the US economy particularly delicate. A scenario where the Fed postpones the normalization process could 
create bubbles in asset prices, while if the Fed responds categorically to neutralize the fiscal stimulus, it might trigger an 
excessive adjustment in asset prices and an increase in volatility. Thus, the lack of coordination between fiscal and monetary 
policy in the United States is one of the main risks identified in this Report.

resolved, including a high level of domestic indebtedness. Any pitfalls in this process could have significant effects 
on the prices of global financial assets and commodities. Another important risk, which has gained importance in 
recent days, relates to the announced protectionist policies that may affect global trade. Beyond the short-term 
effects, such measures would negatively affect the world economy's and Chile's trend growth. 
Domestically,  the  Board  estimates  that  the  risks  to  activity  are  upwards  biased.  The  outlook  for  2018  shows 
investment growing in line with GDP. However, it may prove more dynamic, considering the favorable external 
scenario, the expansionary nature of monetary policy, improved confidence indicators and the data of recent 
months. This risk is tempered in part because the stagnant creation of private salaried jobs and weaker growth in 
nominal wages continue to be causes for concern. In any case, different surveys show that the companies have 
improved  their  prospects  for  employment  and  investment  in  recent  months,  reflecting  their  better  growth 
expectations (figure 10). 
About inflation, the Board estimates that risks are unbiased. The threats to its convergence to 3% are milder, 
primarily  due  to  the  way  the  improved  economic  outlook  affects  the  closure  of  capacity  gaps.  However,  the 
evolution of the exchange rate over the coming months will pull inflation down below the December expectations, 
a situation that the Board will continue to monitor with special care, given that it could have negative implications 
on the convergence of inflation to the target in the policy horizon. 
In short, as I noted at the beginning, this Report clearly shows a turning point in the business cycle that translates 
into an upward revision of the growth projections for 2018, giving way to lower risks for both activity and inflation. 
Anyway, in the baseline scenario that we have just presented, we consider that the risks for inflation and an 
economy that has yet to consolidate its greater dynamism make it necessary for the monetary stimulus to persist 
further. Therefore, we will only begin to raise the MPR when we are certain that the process of inflation converging 
to 3% is consolidating. 
The analysis of external risks contained in this Report reminds us of the importance of the exchange rate being 
the first buffer of external shocks, causing the economy to respond through changes in relative prices rather than 
the  levels  of  demand  and  activity.  Additional  evidence  presented  in  this  Report  shows  that  countries  with  a 
floating  exchange  rate  also  reduce  the  volatility  of  long-term  interest  rates,  which  are  a  determinant  of 
investment. Moreover, developing market instruments to manage foreign exchange risk generates a stronger 
basis  for  the  development  and  diversification  of  exports  than  an  uncertain  state  insurance  through  regular 
intervention or the fixing of the exchange rate. 
It is important to recall that the attempts to sustain the exchange rate led the country to a recession in 1999, 
whereas the float significantly reduced the impact of the crises that originated in Argentina and Brazil in 2001-
2003, the financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the end of the commodity boom in 2014. In each of these last three 
episodes, the exchange rate float has provided enough room for monetary policy to reduce cyclical fluctuations. 
Monetary policy and its perspectives are also built using as a working assumption a defined trajectory for fiscal 
policy. The working assumption in this Report is that in 2018 the economy will receive a fiscal impulse in line with 
the budget announced by the authority. From then on, it is assumed that fiscal spending will follow the path of 
fiscal consolidation contained in the Medium-Term Financial Projection of the last Public Finance Report. This 
working  assumption  is  based  on  the  information  made  public  by  the  tax  authority.  Possible  adjustments  to 
amounts and characteristics shall be incorporated as defined by the authority. This includes the formal definition 
 4 
of fiscal policy that the Administration must make through a decree within the first 90 days of its mandate. Finally, 
the  public  discussion  on  changes  in  fiscal  figures  reinforces  the  need  to  improve  the  institutional  framework 
around the issue. Any policy based on rules is effective only if it is predictable, which relies on the stability and 
clarity of its methodology, the commitment to comply with it and the transparency of its effective compliance. 
In  any  case,  for  the  projections  in  this  Report  to  come  true,  especially  in  terms  of  growth,  an  attentive  and 
constructive attitude from all sectors is required. The Chilean economy may continue to grow in the short term 
because it has no major limitations on the macroeconomic side. The activity gap with respect to its potential is 
still significant, the current account deficit is moderate, financial conditions are favorable and inflation is low. If 
the plans of gradual normalization of monetary policy in the developed countries remain in place, the external 
conditions will continue to be good. Finally, the Central Bank will maintain the monetary impulse until it sees clear 
signs of inflation converging to the target and will then withdraw it gradually. 
However,  this  recovery  of  growth  will  occur  most  certainly,  if  investment  recovers  accordingly.  This  is  the 
component of demand that lags the most and, at the same time, contributes to increase potential growth, helping 
to avoid price pressures and thus generating a more gradual convergence of inflation. Although the latest data 
shows an improvement in investment, and our projections assume that this variable will increase more than GDP 
in the 2018/2020 triennium, this is not assured. For it to materialize, some conditions are necessary, including an 
efficient  financial  system  and  authorities  maintaining  a  favorable  climate,  helping  projects  to  meet  the 
environmental,  urban  and  social  standards  adopted  by  the  country.  It  is  always  important  to  be  aware  that 
investment is very sensitive to changes in the external and internal scenarios and depends strongly on having 
favorable conditions for projects to develop. 
In a more medium-term view, even in a scenario where the economy behaves as expected in the coming quarters, 
the fact that activity grows steadily at a faster-than-expected pace requires some changes of a more structural 
nature. Under current conditions, it is not possible to think that the Chilean economy can sustain growth rates 
above 3% to 3.5% in the long term, which is our estimate for trend growth in the medium term. In September of 
last year, we presented the Senate a document in which we gave an account of the factors producing this estimate 
of potential growth and possible ways to improve it. Importantly, behind the growth of sectors other than natural 
resources—Other GDP—was the fact that improvements in human capital, the incorporation of women into the 
labor force, and immigration, would help to offset the negative effects of the aging of the Chilean population and 
the  tendency  to  reduce  the  actual  number  of  hours  worked  that  comes  with  development.  This  projection 
assumed a relatively neutral role for capital, in the sense that it expanded at the same rate as Other GDP. This 
assumption  is  consistent  with  the  capital/product  ratio  remaining  near  its  historical  average,  a  stylized  fact 
observed  in  other  countries  as  well.  For  this  to  occur,  however,  it  is  necessary  for  investment  to  grow  in 
consistency with potential GDP growth again.  
Our projection also assumed that total factor productivity of the sectors unrelated to natural resources would go 
back to grow at rates around its average of the last twenty years, a major challenge, but clearly possible. The 
recovery of the growth trend of productivity of these sectors will be especially important, given the declining trend 
of natural resources, mainly associated with mining ore downgrade. Finally, we show that the Chilean evidence 
suggests that there are significant inefficiencies in the allocation of resources among firms and that there would 
be first-order gains from measures to improve them, which, unlike the case of human capital, could generate 
 5 
profits sooner. Although these policies fall outside the scope of the Central Bank, we believe it is important to 
reiterate their relevance to this Committee. 
Another relevant issue beyond the economic conjuncture is the need for the economy to recover the buffers that 
allowed  macroeconomic  policy  to  operate  countercyclically.  Chile's  macroeconomic  policy  framework  proved 
especially effective in the current cycle. One example of this is that monetary policy was able to accommodate a 
significant rise in inflation caused by a depreciation of the currency, by favoring a reduction in interest rates. This, 
because it was evaluated that the effect of the cyclical weakness of the economy on inflation would weigh more 
than the effects of the exchange rate increase. In the past, a similar situation would have been solved with a rate 
hike  that  would  have  had  negative  effects  on  activity.  This  has  been  made  possible  by  our  economic  policy 
framework that was built based on a low level of public indebtedness, a high degree of capitalization of financial 
institutions, the financial solvency of companies and households, the credibility of fiscal and monetary policy, and 
an adequate level of international reserves. However, the slow growth of the economy over the past several years 
has partly used up these buffers. The level of public indebtedness has increased, banks have reduced their capital 
gaps and household debt has grown, while employment, having moved to more self-employed occupations, has 
less room to sustain itself without an increase in mean productivity (figure 11). 
For this reason, we believe it is important that as the economy returns to higher growth rates, we recover these 
buffers, in order to be well prepared for possible shocks in the future. Thus, this new cycle makes us once again 
face the challenge of laying the foundations for a more stable economy, so that negative cycles do not affect us 
as deeply as they used to in the past. The Central Bank will be available to do its part in this effort, especially in 
terms of controlling inflation and safeguarding financial stability, thereby contributing to the well-being of the 
Chilean population. 
Thank you for your attention. Now if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
