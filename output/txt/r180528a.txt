Introduction 
This evening I would like to discuss potential paths for monetary policy during the next, critical phase of the 
Brexit process.  Note the conditionality of the phrase “potential paths.”  The actual path for policy will depend 
on the outlook for the economy which in turn will depend very much on how the Brexit negotiations evolve.   
Monetary policy is always contingent on the economic outlook.  This is broader than it being data dependent.  
In order to achieve the inflation target, monetary policy needs to adjust not only to news about current 
conditions but also to any changes in likely future circumstances.1  While it may be the MPC that sets 
interest rates, it is ultimately the economy that determines them. 
Monetary policy will be most effective if agents can anticipate how policymakers will react to changing 
conditions.  But the predictability of monetary policy can break down when there are large structural changes 
in: 
-  Supply capacity; 
-  Equilibrium interest rates; or  
-  Trading relationships. 
In such circumstances, forward guidance can help anchor expectations and improve the effectiveness of 
monetary policy. 
This generally wasn’t necessary during the Great Moderation, when the economy was largely subject to a 
series of demand shocks.  The inflation target could be achieved without causing undesirable volatility in 
output and employment (so-called “divine coincidence”2).   
Despite the crisis, divine coincidence has continued to reign in the euro area and the US (see charts in the 
Appendix).  Large output gaps and below-target inflation have pointed monetary policy in the same direction. 
That, unfortunately, has not been the case in the UK economy, which has been subject to a series of major 
supply shocks over the past five years, creating tensions between short-term output and inflation 
stabilisation.  Brexit is the latest and potentially largest example. 
Brexit is a regime shift that has markedly increased the range of possible outcomes for the UK economy and 
therefore the potential paths of monetary policy.   
                                                                   
1 Another dimension to uncertainty is ‘model’ uncertainty around the structure of the economy.  That is distinct from uncertainty about 
possible future events, or ‘shocks’, affecting economy.  Model uncertainty captures uncertainty around how the economy responds to 
those events, including to changes in monetary policy itself.

The major Brexit contingencies include: 
-  The form of the new economic partnership between the EU and UK;   
-  Whether the transition to that end state will be smooth or cliff-edged; and 
-  How agents in the economy (households, businesses and financial markets) react to these 
prospects, particularly the extent to which they are affected by the uncertainty during the 
negotiations and the degree to which they anticipate the outcome and pull forward adjustment.   
As the Brexit process continues and the answers to these questions become clearer, the MPC will adapt its 
specific guidance and monetary policy more broadly in order to meet the inflation target. 
My message this evening is straightforward.  From a monetary policy perspective, the Bank of England is 
ready for Brexit whatever form it takes. 
The role of guidance and the UK experience 
Before turning to Brexit, I would like to review briefly the MPC’s experience with forward guidance.   
The objective of forward guidance is to give insights into the MPC’s reaction function – in other words, how 
the Committee will adjust policy when the outlook for growth and inflation changes.   
In a perfect world, guidance would be redundant.  People would know how the MPC intends to set rates over 
the future and how those intentions would adjust to economic developments in all eventualities – the  
so-called reaction function.  But the world is complex and people don’t have endless time to devote to 
understanding monetary policy.  In practice, therefore, guidance can be useful in providing people with 
information about how the MPC sets policy and, over time, in improving understanding of how monetary 
policy will adjust to news.   
Guidance thus helps people to think along with the Committee so that their expectations about the path of 
policy adapt with ours as economic circumstances change.  This can make monetary policy more effective 
by reducing unwarranted volatility in interest rate expectations and the extent to which the MPC has to move 
Bank Rate to meet the inflation target.  The more those expectations are aligned with the policy path 
necessary to achieve the inflation target, the higher the probability that policy objective will be achieved.   
Guidance is not a promise of the future path of policy.  And its use will not mean that all observers will agree 
on the likely path of policy for the simple reason that not everyone will agree on the likely path for the 
economy.  However, with guidance, someone who has a different outlook can better anticipate how the MPC 
will adjust once the scales fall from the Committee’s eyes.  Again it is the combination of the economy and 
the primacy of the inflation target, not the MPC, that ultimately determines that path of policy.

The MPC’s guidance speaks first and foremost to UK households and businesses. This is particularly 
important during large structural or regime shifts when uncertainty is high.  In the wake of financial crises or 
advance of wholesale changes to trading relationships, people’s expectations for monetary policy can 
understandably diverge from its most likely path to the detriment of the economy’s performance.  Guidance is 
most useful at such turning points.   
The views of economists and financial market participants are, of course, central to the transmission 
mechanism from Bank Rate, set by the MPC, to the various interest rates facing households and businesses 
and to asset prices more generally.   
Guidance can reinforce the transmission mechanism by reducing unnecessary uncertainty – not eliminating 
all uncertainty.3  It is not the same as guaranteeing the future stance of monetary policy.  Indeed, market 
participants can be expected to pay the closest attention to any explicit conditionalities around guidance and 
should usually be the first to update their expectations of policy as the outlook for the economy changes.   
Finally, guidance should be seen in the context of a series of MPC initiatives to increase transparency.  In 
recent years, the MPC has made major structural changes to our communications ranging from publishing 
statements each time we meet to the simultaneous release of Minutes, Inflation Reports and Monetary Policy 
Summaries on Super Thursdays to the provision of the detailed assumptions underlying our projections.  And 
last year, we introduced layered communications, with simpler, more accessible language and graphics to 
reach the broadest possible audience. 
Crucially, the Committee has also initiated an annual stock take of the supply side of the economy.  It now 
publishes its best collective judgments on the natural rate of unemployment, the output gap, as well as the 
expected growth in productivity, labour supply and potential output.  
To draw out these points consider three examples of forward guidance by the MPC. 
The first occurred five years ago when the economy began to recover from the worst downturn since the 
Great Depression.  During previous periods of accelerating growth and firming business confidence, the 
MPC had always tightened policy significantly (as evidenced in the correlation between survey indicators and 
MPC votes seen in Chart 1).  On the basis of this past behaviour, the MPC would have raised interest rates 
by 2 to 3 percentage points between August 2013 and the end of 2014.  For anyone who might suggest the 
MPC should have followed that reaction function, note that, even on unchanged policy, CPI inflation in the 
summer of 2016 was running at only about ½% and core CPI inflation around 1¼%. 
                                                                 
3 In other words, the amount of volatility in interest rates should match the amount of uncertainty surrounding the economy.  There 
should ideally be no additional volatility, or risk premium, due to uncertainty about how policy would respond.

Average MPC vote includes both decisions on Bank Rate and QE, with every extra £25bn of asset purchases (gilts and corporate 
bonds) treated as equivalent to a 25bp cut in Bank Rate (see Joyce, Tong and Woods, 2011).   
 
 
Five years ago, the MPC recognised that past should not be prologue.  The MPC was pretty certain there 
was a large amount of slack, although it had questions over how much productive capacity had been 
destroyed following the crisis; how quickly productivity growth would recover; and whether labour supply 
would change in the wake of reforms and a heavy burden of household debt.  
Such uncertainties about supply meant that knowing what was happening to demand was no longer 
sufficient for gauging the appropriate policy response.  The historic reduced-form reaction function of the 
Committee, based on demand alone, would have been a poor guide to the expected path of policy.   
That is why the Committee provided forward guidance that explicitly linked any potential change in interest 
rates to the unemployment rate – a clear and widely understood indicator of the degree of slack.4  The 
Committee’s objective was to secure the nascent recovery while learning more about the supply capacity of 
the economy. 
The message the Committee gave UK households and businesses was simple:  the MPC would not even 
think about tightening policy at least until the unemployment rate had fallen below 7%, consistent with the 
creation of around three quarter of a million jobs.  We reassured households and businesses that, after five 
years of decline and stagnation, the recovery would not be choked off prematurely. 
That guidance was effective.  Surveys conducted in the months that followed indicated high awareness of it 
among companies, with almost half reporting that they expected Bank Rate to remain at low levels for longer 
than they would have done were guidance not in place.  And the majority said that the Bank’s policy

guidance had made them more confident about UK economic prospects.  Household expectations also 
shifted markedly in favour of fewer and later rate increases.5  Household and business confidence continued 
to strengthen, reinforcing the economic momentum. 
In the event, the unemployment rate fell far faster than we had expected, falling below 7% in February 2014. 
But even as the recovery strengthened and survey indicators of output growth reached levels previously 
associated with sharp policy tightenings (Chart 1), market expectations about the future path of policy 
remained subdued (Chart 2).  Participants understood the conditionality of guidance, as they and the MPC 
learned that there was still considerable spare capacity in the economy.

The MPC’s second use of guidance responded to another structural development: the sharp fall in the 
equilibrium real interest rate, or r*.6   
In February 2014, the Committee explained why it expected the equilibrium rate of interest to be much lower 
than in the past, and then outlined the possible consequences for policy.7   
The Committee signalled that the policy path was likely to be different from the past.  It observed that the 
appropriate path of interest rate increases to eliminate slack and keep inflation close to the target was 
                                                                 
5 For more information, see the box on page 12 of the February 2014 Inflation Report. 
6 This is the policy rate that, if allowed to prevail for several years, would keep economic activity at potential and inflation at target. 
7 Secular drivers that had pushed down the equilibrium rate prior to the crisis – including slower potential growth, demographic forces, 
changes in income distribution and excess saving in emerging markets – were likely to persist.  Colleagues at the Bank of England 
estimate that these factors can explain around 400 of the 450 basis points fall in global long-term equilibrium rates since the 1980s (see 
Rachel, L and Smith, T (2015), “Secular drivers of the global real interest rate”, Bank of England Working Paper No. 571).  In addition, 
more cyclical factors, such as the protracted process of balance sheet repair in both public and private sectors, had weighed further on 
the equilibrium real rate, causing it to turn sharply negative during the downturn.  The MPC expected these forces to fade only gradually 
as the economy recovered.  See Carney, M (2013), “The spirit of the season” at The Economic Club of New York;  and the box on page 
42 of the August 2014 Inflation Report.

expected to be gradual and, even once spare capacity had been absorbed, the appropriate level of Bank 
Rate was expected to be materially below the pre-crisis average of 5%.   
Out of that guidance came the phrase ‘limited and gradual’, so often repeated it has now become part of the 
monetary policy furniture.  Importantly, it is widely recognised by UK households and businesses whose 
expectations of rate increases have remained well anchored as the recovery has progressed (Charts 3b and 
3c) as well as by financial markets (Chart 3a).  Similar guidance was subsequently adopted by the FOMC 
and ECB.8

“prudence, patience and persistence with regard to monetary policy remained warranted”.

As intended, “limited and gradual” guidance has dampened interest rate volatility (Chart 4) and reduced the 
correlation between interest rate volatility and economic uncertainty (Chart 5).9  Both developments have 
increased the degree of monetary policy stimulus, thereby reinforcing the recovery during turbulent times.  
                                                                 
9 Part of the fall in volatility is likely to be due to rates being close to the lower bound, since this cuts off part of the lower tail of the 
distribution.

option-implied volatility, dispersion of company earnings forecasts and among forecasters’ growth projections, proportion of companies 
reporting that uncertainty is limiting investment, households’ unemployment expectations, and number of press articles citing ‘economic 
uncertainty’.  See Haddow, A, Hare, C, Hooley, J and Shakir, T (2013) “Macroeconomic uncertainty: what is it, how can we measure it

The MPC is now in the process of reviewing the possible range for the equilibrium real interest rate in the 
medium term.  This analysis reflects the importance of global equilibrium rates for the UK, and the 
possibilities that the global equilibrium real rate may rise as the global recovery proceeds and that domestic 
cyclical factors such as the pace of public and private balance sheet repair may shift.  The Committee 
intends to provide information about its updated view in its August Inflation Report. 
Guidance, Contingency and Brexit  
My third example of guidance is associated with another major structural change: Brexit.  
To put the upcoming regime shift into context, consider what has already transpired merely in anticipation of 
possible future changes to flow of goods, service, capital and people. 
On the eve of the referendum, the MPC expected that a vote to leave would prompt the exchange rate to fall 
sharply, inflation to rise above the 2% target and growth to slow materially. 
That is exactly what has happened. 
Sterling fell sharply immediately following the result, and remains some 15% below its late-2015 peak before 
the referendum was called.  Financial markets are valuing today what they expect tomorrow: a relative fall in 
real incomes as the UK moves toward its new trading arrangements.   
Inflation rose well above the 2% target, peaking at 3.1% late last year, an overshoot entirely due to the 
referendum-induced fall in the exchange rate. 
And UK growth has dropped from the fastest to the slowest in the G7.  The economy has significantly 
underperformed the MPC’s projections ahead of the referendum, which were conditioned on a vote to 
remain.11  That deceleration has occurred despite support from a much stronger-than-anticipated euro-area 
and global growth and much more supportive domestic financial conditions, with the latter importantly 
influenced by the timely, comprehensive package of easing measures introduced by the Bank’s policy 
committees after the vote.   
The MPC now views the economy’s potential growth rate to be around 1.5%, about 60% of its pre-crisis 
average.  That diminished rate of supply growth reflects the climate of the past few years, with the shallowest 
investment recovery in over half a century,12 lower growth in labour supply and modest productivity growth.   
By the first quarter of this year, UK GDP had increased by 1 percentage point less than the MPC had 
projected in May 2016.  Factoring in the stronger-than-anticipated growth in the European and global 
economies and more supportive fiscal policy, the shortfall increases to around 1¾%-2%. 
                                                                 
11 This was in line with the MPC’s standard approach to condition its projections on the government policy of the time. 
12 By contrast, growth in UK total investment outperformed the rest of the G7 in 2017.  That reflected strong growth in spending on 
buildings.  Dwellings investment (1.7pp) and spending on other buildings and structures (2.1pp) together contributed 3.8pp to total 
growth of 4.0%.

Even without taking those additional factors into account, average household incomes are currently 4% lower 
than the MPC had expected prior to the referendum, equivalent to over £900 per household.13 
Lambda:  trade-off management in exceptional circumstances 
The MPC has repeatedly emphasised that monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real 
adjustment as the UK moves to its new trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth likely to 
accompany that adjustment.  Monetary policy can, however, support the economy during the adjustment 
process.   
During these exceptional circumstances, the MPC is required by its remit to balance the trade-off between 
the speed at which inflation is returned to target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and 
activity.14  
The MPC set out our framework for managing this trade-off including guidance on its tolerance for the 
overshoot of inflation of target under exceptional circumstances.   
Chart 6 illustrates the MPC’s framework for setting policy to manage this trade-off.  The red lines represent 
the potential trade-offs that the Committee could strike:  mapping the size of the inflation overshoot that it 
could be prepared to tolerate for a given amount of spare capacity, and vice versa.  The flatter the line, the 
less weight the Committee places on output stabilisation and the more it is willing to tolerate large output 
gaps in order to eliminate small overshoots in inflation.  
Chart 6 also demonstrates how the expected trade-off has evolved in successive MPC forecasts since the 
referendum.  It shows the MPC's central projections at Year 2 for CPI inflation on the vertical axis against 
those for spare capacity (the opposite of excess demand) on the horizontal axis from successive Inflation 
Reports since August 2016.  The projections are conditioned on the market yield curves prevailing at the 
time the forecasts were made. 
Consistent with its remit, the MPC has judged that it has been appropriate to set policy so that inflation 
returned to its target over a longer period than the conventional horizon of 18-24 months in order to support 
jobs and activity at a time when uncertainty was elevated and the economy was slowing.  It therefore 
implemented a package of easing measures in August 2016 – shifting the trade-off upwards and to the right 
                                                                 
13 One third of the 4% shortfall in real wages reflects stronger-than-projected inflation, which is almost entirely accounted for by the 
referendum-related fall in sterling.  The remainder reflects weaker-than-expected nominal wages, the majority of which can be 
accounted for by weaker-than-anticipated productivity growth. 
14 Specifically, in exceptional circumstances, “shocks to the economy may be particularly large or the effects of shocks may persist over 
an extended period or both”. When this is the case, the challenge facing the MPC can be more significant, and the remits directs that 
“[i]n forming and communicating its judgements, the Committee should promote understanding of the trade-offs inherent in setting 
monetary policy”, including, importantly “the horizon over which the Committee judges it is appropriate to return inflation to the target”.

  Since then, the Committee has managed policy to diminish steadily the trade-off, increasing employment, 
using up the expected degree of spare capacity in the economy, and reducing the expected overshoot of the 
inflation target.  
Throughout this period, inflation expectations have remained well anchored,17 the volatility of interest rates 
very low, and financial conditions highly supportive. 
Over the course of 2017, the steady absorption of slack and the prospect of moving into excess demand by 
Year 3 – evident in the dots showing the successive Inflation Report projections in Chart 6 – reduced the 
degree to which it was appropriate to accommodate an extended period of inflation above the target.  As a 
consequence, the MPC began to remove some of the stimulus policy had been providing raising Bank Rate 
to ½ percent last November (the pink dot in Chart 7).  
                                                                 
15 Calculations at the time suggested that returning inflation to target at a conventional horizon could have cost ¼ million jobs and 
widened the output gap to 1½%.  See ‘Lambda’, speech by Mark Carney at the London School of Economics, 16 January 2017. 
16 Each observation shows the central projection for spare capacity or excess demand at the end of the second year of the forecast 
period (the 'Year 2' point) on the horizontal axis against the central projection for four-quarter CPI inflation at Year 2 on the vertical axis 
from successive Inflation Reports. The left-most observation (labelled "Aug. 2016 no stimulus") is a counterfactual version of the August 
2016 Inflation Report forecasts with the effect of the MPC's Bank Rate cut, Term Funding Scheme and Asset Purchases removed.  See 
’Lambda’, speech by Mark Carney at the London School of Economics, 16h January 2017, for further details and discussion.

 A Guidance Stocktake 
As the UK enters the most critical phase of the Brexit negotiations, it is useful to take stock of forward 
guidance and its potential role during the upcoming period. 
The interest rate expectations of households and businesses have remained in line with the MPC’s limited 
and gradual guidance (see Charts 3b and 3c).  
The MPC’s guidance has anchored expectations in financial markets that interest rates will rise at a gradual 
pace and to a limited extent (Chart 3a). 
Guidance has dampened the volatility of interest rates, consistent with the expected and actual path of policy 
rates (Chart 4). 
Guidance has reduced the impact of economic uncertainty on short-term interest rates (Chart 5). 
The responsiveness of market interest rates to economic data has generally been higher in the UK than in 
the US or euro area (Chart 8). 
While there have been occasions where financial market expectations diverged somewhat from upcoming 
MPC decisions, these should be kept in perspective.  Divergences have generally been modest moves 
around the exact timing of a few rate increases over the next few years, as opposed to the launch of the 
sharp tightening cycles of days gone by (6 to 8 rate increases over 12 to 15 months (Chart 3)).  Short-term 
interest rate volatility in the UK has been in line with that in other major economies and is very low relative to 
history, only in the 5th percentile of its historical distribution since 1997 (Chart 9).

Guidance into Brexit 
Now, with the excess supply in the economy virtually used up and the Brexit date looming, monetary policy 
could travel along two broad paths. 
The first path is consistent with the MPC’s current central projection which assumes a smooth transition to a 
Brexit that is the average of a range of outcomes.  In this case, the Committee’s reaction function will 
become conventional again, with the path of policy driven primarily by demand.   
A sharper Brexit could put monetary policy on a different path.  For example, if the transition were disorderly, 
or the end state agreement materially worse than the average potential outcome, then the MPC could once 
again be confronted by a trade-off between the speed with which it returns inflation to target and the support 
policy provides to jobs and activity.  On this path, the MPC can be expected to set policy to manage any 
trade-off using the framework it applied following the referendum. 
The dependence of policy on which Brexit path is taken is one reason why guidance remains valuable during 
this crucial phase.  Let me expand, beginning with the MPC’s current policy stance. 
The Committee’s latest guidance  
The MPC published its latest assessment of the outlook in our May Inflation Report.  In the MPC’s central 
forecast, conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by current market yields, GDP is 
expected to grow by around 1¾% per year on average over the forecast period.  While modest by historical 
standards, the projected pace of GDP growth over the forecast is nonetheless slightly faster than the 
diminished rate of supply growth, which is projected to average around 1½% per year.  Recall that the MPC 
now publishes all of its key assumptions about supply. 
In the MPC’s central projection, a small margin of excess demand emerges by early 2020, feeding through 
into higher rates of pay growth and domestic cost pressures.  Although inflation is projected to fall further 
over this year as the impact of sterling’s past depreciation continues to wane, building domestic inflationary 
pressures mean inflation settles at the 2% target around mid-2020. 
As the MPC has stressed, were the economy to develop broadly in line with the May Inflation Report 
projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate to return 
inflation sustainably to its target at a conventional horizon.  
One simple way to illustrate the potential need for modest rate rises is to look at the Committee’s projection 
conditioned on a constant rate.  In it, excess demand increases to close to 1% of GDP three years from now 
and inflation is well above target at 2.4% at years 2 and 3 (Chart 10).

  Of course, as the Committee has made clear before, its guidance about the likely gentle path of rate 
increases depends on the economy evolving broadly as expected – in particular, whether growth in demand 
exceeds that of supply. 
That might not happen.  For example, the weakness in demand at the start of the year could reflect a 
worsening of the underlying economic climate, not the temporary effects of adverse weather as the 
Committee currently assesses.   
In particular, there is somewhat greater uncertainty about the near-term momentum in consumer spending at 
present, given recent weakness in consumer credit and the housing market across a range of indicators.  
Growth in consumer credit, particularly credit cards, slowed sharply in March.  Retail sales volumes have 
been falling and profit warnings in the retail sector rising.  And activity and inflation in the housing market is 
subdued, despite very low mortgage rates.   
The MPC’s projections assume that households will increase their spending broadly in line with their real 
incomes, as the squeeze following the Brexit vote comes to an end.  The bar is relatively low as it implies 
household spending growth at half its pre-referendum pace and one third of its pre-crisis clip despite record 
employment and rising real wages. 
But there is a risk that households could opt to save rather than spend as their real incomes recover.  The 
more the expectations of households for Brexit resemble those of financial markets and businesses, the 
more growth is likely to slow below its trend.  Excess supply would therefore widen, dampening the expected

increases in domestic inflationary pressures so that inflation falls well below the target (Chart 11).18

Notes:  Per cent of potential GDP.  A negative figure implies output is below potential and a positive that it is above  
 
 
In the opposite direction, growth could surprise on the upside, requiring monetary policy to be tightened by a 
little more, a little sooner than in the May conditioning path.  For example, if business investment growth 
were to recover much more strongly than currently projected – perhaps because of improved in sentiment 
about progress on Brexit – then demand would grow well in excess of supply, pushing inflation above target 
throughout the forecast in the absence of tighter policy.19   
These scenarios illustrate how guidance, by revealing the MPC’s reaction function, allows people to 
anticipate how policy will adapt as the circumstances change.   
The Other Brexit Path  
Now consider a different Brexit path where the transition isn’t smooth and/or the final outcome is less open 
than the MPC’s conditioning assumption. 
The Bank is doing all it can to reduce the risks of the former.  We are taking steps to reduce financial stability 
risks around Brexit, just as we did around the referendum when we engaged in extensive contingency 
planning with HM Treasury, foreign central banks, and private financial institutions.   
In particular, the FPC has identified the Brexit “cliff edge” risks and now publishes a quarterly checklist of 
progress towards their mitigation. 
Wherever it can, the Bank is reducing Brexit financial stability risks.  For example, our stress test last year 
encompassed a wide range of UK macroeconomic risks and associated losses that could be associated with 
Brexit, including a disorderly exit, with UK GDP falling by almost 5%, falls in commercial and residential 
property prices of over 30%, Bank Rate increasing by 4 percentage points and unemployment rising to 9½%.  
UK banks were able to withstand that stress and still have more than adequate capital to maintain lending to 
households and businesses.  To be clear, the Bank of England is confident that major UK banks have the 
balance sheets and liquidity positions to withstand a cliff-edge Brexit. 
 19 An alternative scenario that would also require a tighter path for policy is weaker supply growth.

For risks that private financial institutions cannot self-solve, the Bank of England is working with HMT to find 
solutions.  For example, the Government has led by committing to put in place if necessary a temporary 
permission regime to ensure that EU firms can continue their activities in the UK for a limited period after 
withdrawal.20 
And where the issues are cross border, the Bank is working with the ECB to manage risks in the period 
around Brexit related to financial services, through a new technical working group chaired by President 
Draghi and myself.   
A more disorderly transition, or a materially different end state from our assumption, would have implications 
for monetary policy.  To understand the MPC’s potential response, businesses, households and market 
participants can draw on the Committee’s track record of managing the trade-off that emerged after the 
referendum, since exactly the same framework would apply.   
As then, the policy response would reflect the balance of the effects of a sharper Brexit on demand, supply 
and the exchange rate.  Given the exceptional circumstances, the Committee would have to decide whether 
to extend the period over which inflation is returned to target in order to provide support to jobs and activity.  
Although the exact policy response cannot be predicted in advance, observers know from our track record 
that, in exceptional circumstances, we are both willing to tolerate some deviation of inflation from target for a 
limited period of time and that there are limits to that tolerance. 
Conclusion 
In recent years, the UK has faced a series of supply shocks and regime shifts that have created a series of 
difficult trade-offs for monetary policy.  Brexit is the most recent and potentially the most important of these.  
It will soon be entering a critical phase.  
The paths that the economy, and monetary policy, could take from here are connected by the expectations of 
households, businesses and financial markets.   
Since the referendum was called, these have reacted at different speeds and to varying degrees to the 
prospects for the UK’s departure from the EU. 
Financial markets, particularly sterling, moved quickly and sharply.  Bank analysis suggests that Brexit 
remains the most important driver of short term market interest rates since then (Chart 12).

Households looked through Brexit-related uncertainties initially.  But as the consequences of sterling’s fall 
showed up in the shops and squeezed their real incomes, they have cut back spending growth to rates about 
one half of those pre-referendum.  
Businesses have been somewhere in between.  Since the referendum, they have invested much less 
aggressively than usual in response to an otherwise very favourable environment – with global demand 
growing strongly, limited spare capacity, relatively high rates of return on capital and the low cost of finance – 
reflecting the drag from Brexit-related uncertainties.  Evidence from the Bank’s Decision Maker Panel survey 
indicates that drag took 3-4% off business investment last year.  That effect persists, though it has not 
intensified. 
As the Committee has repeatedly stressed, how the economy evolves will depend on how these 
expectations change as Brexit progresses.   
On the one hand, increased caution could drag on demand.   
On the other, if there is progress towards the new, deep and special partnership the government is seeking, 
a boom in investment and potentially consumption could be unlocked, boosting output. 
From a monetary policy perspective, the Bank is ready for Brexit.  The MPC is well-prepared for whichever 
path the economy takes.  We have the tools we need.  We will be prudent not passive.  We will respond to

any change in the outlook in these exceptional circumstances to bring inflation sustainably back to target 
while supporting jobs and activity, consistent with our remit.   
Our guidance means that those who follow us will be better able to anticipate our actions.  It will make those 
actions more powerful.  And it will help households and businesses consume, save, hire and invest with 
confidence as the UK determines its path forward.

Appendix 
Frequently, the economy experiences shocks that drive inflation and output in the same direction.  These 
shocks to aggregate demand can include variations in government consumption, households’ desire to 
consume, or business’ desire to invest.  Increases in demand put pressure on the use of resources, causing 
prices to rise.  Because monetary policy can also influence demand it can lean against such shocks.  If 
successful, it can stabilise inflation. In this case, no output-inflation trade-off arises.  This is the so-called 
“divine coincidence”. 
Things are different when shocks drive inflation up or down independently of demand. Exogenous changes 
in firms’ pricing power are one example – so-called cost-push shocks. Shocks to the exchange rate, the 
economy’s supply capacity, or commodity prices also have this flavour.  Because monetary policy’s influence 
on inflation is predominantly an indirect one, via demand, in such circumstances inflation can only be 
controlled by delivering an opposing movement in aggregate spending. If something pushes up on inflation 
directly, monetary policy can only bring inflation back down by causing a reduction in spending via higher 
interest rates. The speed with which this adjustment is delivered is determined by the monetary policy maker 
guided by their remit. 
Such circumstances have characterised the period in the UK since the global financial crisis (Chart A1), 
which entailed a large adjustment to the supply side of the economy, meaning a lower exchange rate, lower 
growth, and higher inflation. 
In contrast, the US and the euro area have seldom faced a trade-off between output and inflation 
stabilisation, even since the global financial crisis (Charts A2 and A3).
