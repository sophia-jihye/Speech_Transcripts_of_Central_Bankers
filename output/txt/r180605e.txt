Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy 
Speech at the Kisaragi-kai Meeting in Tokyo 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
It is my great pleasure to have the opportunity today to speak at the Kisaragi-kai meeting. 
 Five  years  have  passed  since  the  Bank  introduced  quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary 
easing  (QQE)  in  April  2013,  and  Japan's  economy  --  which  had  been  deteriorating  under 
prolonged  deflation  --  has  improved  significantly.  Recently,  corporate  profits  have  been at 
record  high  levels,  and  the  labor  market  is  close  to  full  employment.  Although  the  price 
stability target of 2 percent has not been achieved yet, Japan's economy is at least no longer 
in  deflation,  which  is  generally  defined  as  a  sustained  decline  in  prices,  after  having 
overcome negative shocks such as the large drop in crude oil prices. Over the past year, the 
year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  consumer  price  index  (CPI)  has  increased  moderately, 
registering around 1 percent of late. Today, I will first explain in detail the current situation 
of  economic  activity  in  Japan  and  its  outlook,  while  outlining  the  Outlook  for  Economic 
Activity  and  Prices  (Outlook  Report)  released  after  the  Monetary  Policy  Meeting  (MPM) 
held  at  the  end  of  April.  Then,  I  would  like  to  talk  about  the  Bank's  thinking  behind  the 
conduct of monetary policy. 
 I. The Current Situation of Economic Activity and Its Outlook 
Overseas Economies 
Let me start by talking about economic developments. I will first touch on developments in 
overseas economies. 
 Overseas  economies  have  continued  to  grow  firmly.  The  last  time  I  gave  a  speech  at  the 
Kisaragi-kai  meeting  last  December,  I  referred  to  the  remark  by  Christine  Lagarde,  the 
Managing  Director  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  that  the  global  economy  is 
showing  "the  broadest-based  recovery  in  the  last  10  years."  In  the  almost  half  year  since 
then, this synchronous growth of the global economy, with both the advanced and emerging 
economies  growing  in  a  well-balanced  manner,  has  become  more  pronounced.  Such 
synchronous growth can also be observed at the industry level (Chart 1). While the global 
economy  had  continued  to  recover  moderately  over  the  past  few  years,  led  mainly  by  the 
nonmanufacturing  sector,  since  around  last  year,  production  and  trade  activity  in  the 
manufacturing  sector  have  picked  up  substantially,  reflecting  an  expansion  in  IT-related 
 1 
demand due to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), as well 
as  growing  demand  for  capital  goods  due  to  a  rise  in  capital  utilization  rates  on  a  global 
basis. 
 Given  such  positive  cycle  operating  in a  wide  range  of  regions  and industries,  it  is  highly 
likely that overseas economies will continue to grow firmly for the time being. In the IMF's 
quarterly  projections  for  global  economic  growth  based  on  its  World  Economic  Outlook 
(WEO),  those  for  2018  and  2019  were  revised  upward  markedly  in  April  2018  from  the 
October  2017  projections,  with  growth  expected  to  register  3.9  percent,  exceeding  the 
long-term average since the 1990s. There is, of course, considerable uncertainty as to how 
long such high economic growth will last. Among advanced economies, the U.S. economy 
in  particular  has  continued  its  long  recovery  phase  for  nine  years  already,  and  the  growth 
pace is projected to decelerate somewhat around 2020. In this context, some have expressed 
concerns that the U.S. economy might experience a significant downturn, but I consider this 
risk  to  be  small.  The  reason  is that, in the  early  phase  of  the current recovery  in  the  early 
2010s, the level of economic activity was low and the growth pace remained very moderate. 
Therefore, although the economy has been recovering for a long time, there seem to be no 
signs of overheating, such as  an excess build-up of capital and housing stock. Meanwhile, 
the recovery in emerging economies is likely to take a firmer hold, given that growth rates 
in commodity-exporting economies -- which had been lagging behind due to the effects of 
sluggish commodity prices -- have been gradually increasing. Thus, overseas economies are 
expected  to  grow  firmly,  with  growth  momentum  shifting  from  advanced  to  emerging 
economies. 
 Current Situation of Japan's Economic Activity 
Next, I will talk about Japan's economy. The economy has been expanding steadily, albeit at 
a  moderate  pace,  supported  in  part  by  the  growth  in  overseas  economies  that  I  just 
mentioned. The output gap, which represents the utilization of capital and labor, exceeded 
the long-term average of 0 percent in the second half of 2016, and since then has continued 
to  widen  further  in  positive  territory  (Chart  2).  The  diffusion  index  (DI)  for  business 
conditions  for  all  industries  and  enterprises  in  the  Bank's  Tankan  (Short-Term  Economic 
Survey  of  Enterprises  in  Japan)  --  which  is  an  indicator  of  firms'  business  sentiment  -- 
 2 
suggests  that  business  conditions  have  improved  for  seven  consecutive  quarters,  reaching 
the highest level since the early 1990s. 
 Looking  in  more  detail,  in  the  corporate  sector,  exports  and  production  have  been  on  an 
increasing trend (Chart 3). As I mentioned earlier, demand for IT-related and capital goods 
has  been  expanding  on  a  global  basis,  and  this  has  acted  as  a  tailwind  for  Japan's 
manufacturing  sector,  which  has  a  comparative  advantage  in  these  goods.  In  fact,  Japan's 
real  exports  marked  a  new  record  high  in  November  2017  for  the  first  time  in  about  10 
years,  exceeding  the  peak  before  the  global  financial  crisis,  and  have  maintained  their 
uptrend.  In  this  situation,  corporate  profits  have  been  at  record  high  levels,  and  business 
fixed  investment  has  continued  on  an  increasing  trend.  According  to  the  Tankan,  business 
fixed investment plans for fiscal 2018 as of March have turned out to be favorable for this 
time of the year, significantly exceeding the average of the past. 
 There  also  has  been  improvement  in  the  household  sector.  While  labor  market  conditions 
have been tightening further, with the unemployment rate declining to about 2.5 percent for 
the first time since 1993, employee income has continued to increase moderately (Chart 4). 
Private  consumption  has  been  increasing  moderately,  albeit  with  fluctuations,  against  the 
background of this steady improvement in the employment and income situation. 
 Outlook for Japan's Economic Activity 
Now I will turn to the outlook for Japan's economy. In the latest Outlook Report released at 
the  end  of  April,  the  Bank  presents  its  projections  for  Japan's  economic  activity  through 
fiscal 2020. In terms of the medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts, the real GDP 
growth rate is projected to register relatively high growth of 1.6 percent in fiscal 2018 and 
continue to mark positive growth of 0.8 percent in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 (Chart 5). 
 In  fiscal  2018,  the  mechanism  supporting  the  current  favorable  economic  conditions  is 
expected  to  continue  operating.  Domestic  demand  is  likely  to  follow  an  uptrend,  mainly 
against 
the  background  of  highly  accommodative  financial  conditions  and 
the 
underpinnings  through  government  spending.  Exports  are  expected  to  continue  their 
moderate  increasing  trend  on  the  back  of  the  firm  growth  in  overseas  economies.  Under 
 3 
these  circumstances,  in  fiscal  2018,  the  economy  is  likely  to  continue  growing  at  a  pace 
above  the  potential  growth  rate,  which  is currently  estimated  to  be  in the  range  of  0.5-1.0 
percent. 
 From  fiscal  2019  through  fiscal  2020,  Japan's  economy  is  expected  to  continue  on  an 
expanding  trend,  although  the  growth  pace  is  projected  to  decelerate  somewhat.  If  the 
economy performs as projected, the duration of the current recovery phase, which started in 
December 2012, will be the longest in the post-war era, significantly exceeding the record 
of  73  months  registered  during  the  recovery  period  in  the  2000s  (Chart  6).  The  key  issue 
underlying this outlook are the reasons why the long-lasting recovery is likely to continue. 
In what follows, I will outline three reasons. 
 The  first  is  that  overseas  economies  are  projected  to  continue  growing  firmly  in  a 
well-balanced  manner  in  terms  of  regions  and  industries,  as  I  explained  earlier.  Japan's 
exports are expected to follow an increasing trend supported by this tailwind and continue 
to firmly underpin the economy. 
 The second reason is that, even though Japan's economic expansion is becoming quite long, 
it is likely that the pressure to adjust accumulated capital stock will not heighten as much. In 
the  past,  long-lasting  economic  expansion  was  accompanied  by  a  capital  stock  cycle,  in 
which  capital  stock  gradually  had  built  up  and  capacity  utilization  rates  had  declined, 
thereby  suppressing  new  business  fixed  investment.  It  is  expected  that,  during  the  current 
recovery  phase,  capital  accumulation  will  continue  to  some  extent  in  such  areas  as 
construction  in  the  leadup  to  the  Tokyo  Olympic  Games  in  2020.  However,  in  the 
manufacturing sector, there is a sense that capital stock is still insufficient, mainly due to the 
increase  in  exports,  and  it  is  likely  that  the  expansion  in  global  IT-related  demand 
underlying  this  increase  in  exports  will  continue  to  last  for  a  long  time.  In  addition,  due 
mainly to acute labor shortage, many firms in a wide range of industries are actively making 
labor-saving investment, and in view of the structural decline in the working-age population, 
these  developments  are  expected  to  continue  going  forward.  Furthermore,  it  can  be 
expected  that  firms'  growth  expectations  will  gradually  improve.  If  firms'  growth 
expectations  rise,  they  will  revise  upward  the  level  of  capital  stock  that  they  consider 
 4 
necessary  for  future  production  activities,  creating  new  investment  demand.  With  the 
economic  and  price  situation  continuing  to  improve,  and  coupled  with  the  government's 
growth  strategy,  it  is  expected  that  firms'  sentiment  --  which  had  deteriorated  under 
deflation -- will improve, stimulating investment demand. 
 The  third  reason  is  that  private  consumption  is  likely  to  continue  increasing  moderately 
amid  the  improvement  in  the  employment  and  income  situation.  In  this  context,  the 
consumption  tax  hike  scheduled  for  October  2019  may  affect  the  economic  growth  rates 
going forward. However, the increase in the consumption tax rate is smaller than that of the 
previous tax hike in 2014, and measures such as a reduced tax rate and free education will 
be  implemented.  Therefore,  the  increase  in  the  household  burden  as  well  as  the  negative 
impact  on  private  consumption  and  the  economic  growth  rates  are  expected  to  be  smaller 
than after the last tax hike. 
 Risks to Economic Activity 
There are, of course, upside and downside risks to this baseline scenario of the outlook for 
Japan's economic activity. 
 One  of  the  risk  factors  is  the  U.S.  economic  policies,  especially  the  heightening 
uncertainties  over  its  protectionist  trade  policy.  As  stated  in  the  Group  of  Twenty  (G-20) 
communiqué,  "[i]nternational  trade  and  investment  are  important  engines  of  growth, 
productivity,  innovation,  job  creation  and  development."  Therefore,  if  protectionist  moves 
were to spread globally, they could hamper trade activity, which finally has been recovering, 
and  constrain  global  economic  growth.  As  economies  have  become  increasingly 
interdependent through global value chains, countries that adopt  protectionist policies may 
face disadvantages in that such policies could impede necessary imports. Therefore, a brake 
is  expected  to  be  put  on  excessive  protectionist  moves  at  some  point,  but  we  will  not  be 
complacent and will closely monitor the situation. 
 The effects of major economies' policies on global financial markets also warrant attention. 
For  instance,  global  equity  markets  have  been  unstable  since  February  this  year,  and  it  is 
said that this was triggered by a sharp increase in long-term interest rates reflecting the fact 
 5 
that  U.S.  wage  growth  exceeded  market  expectations,  which  gave  rise  to  speculation  that 
the  pace  of  policy  rate  hikes  by  the  Federal  Reserve  could  accelerate.  In  addition,  the 
uncertainties  over  U.S.  trade  policy  that  I  mentioned  earlier  have  been  cited  as  another 
reason  for  the  recent  volatility  in  stock  prices  in  various  countries  and  foreign  exchange 
rates.  With  the  fundamentals  of  major  economies  remaining  favorable,  financial  markets 
have  been  regaining  some  calmness,  but  markets  sometimes  move  suddenly,  triggered  by 
minor matters. As volatility in financial markets may affect firms' and households' sentiment, 
we will pay constant attention to financial market developments. 
 Turning to domestic risk factors, we need to bear in mind uncertainty regarding the effects 
of the scheduled consumption tax hike that I mentioned earlier, as well as both upside and 
downside risks to developments in firms' growth expectations. For example, firms may not 
abandon  the  cautious  mindset  that  had  become  entrenched  under  deflation  and  easily 
embark on proactive investment activities. On the other hand, it is also possible that, amid 
rising growth expectations, there may be a major switch among firms to start using the high 
level of accumulated corporate savings for proactive investment. 
 II. Current Situation of and Outlook for Prices 
Current Situation of and Outlook for Prices 
Next, I will move on to price developments in Japan. The year-on-year rate of change in the 
CPI excluding fresh food has increased to around 1 percent. The rise in energy prices partly 
contributed  to  this,  and  the  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI  for  March  excluding  fresh  food  and 
energy was 0.5 percent (Chart 7). The Bank has not changed its basic assessment that prices 
have continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the economic expansion 
and  the  labor  market  tightening.  Nevertheless,  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI 
has  been  rising  steadily  for  over  a  year,  albeit  at  a  moderate  pace,  and  the  momentum 
toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent is firmly maintained. 
 Going  forward,  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI  is  likely  to  continue  on  an 
uptrend and increase toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of an improvement in the output 
gap  and  a  rise  in  medium-  to  long-term  inflation  expectations.  This  baseline  scenario  is 
unchanged from the previous ones. The medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts of 
 6 
the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI  excluding  fresh  food  are  1.3  percent  for  fiscal 
2018 and 1.8 percent for both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 (Chart 8). 
 The Inflation Mechanism 
I  would  now  like  to  explain  the  mechanism  through  which  inflation  will  rise  toward  2 
percent. The Bank conceptually divides this mechanism into two steps. First, the output gap 
improves in line with economic expansion, which will raise actual prices by making firms' 
wage- and price-setting stance more proactive. Second, as actual prices increase, firms' and 
households' medium- to long-term inflation expectations rise, which will further push up the 
actual inflation rate. 
 As  for  the  first  step,  the  improvement  in  the  output  gap  is  steadily  pushing  up  wages  and 
prices. In terms of wages, those of not only part-time but also full-time employees are rising 
against  the  backdrop  of  tightening  labor  market  conditions.  According  to  various  surveys, 
the rate of increase in base pay for fiscal 2018 has exceeded the actual rate for last year, and 
the proportion of firms that are increasing wages for full-time employees has also increased 
(Chart 9). Firms are also increasingly reflecting rising wage costs in their sales prices. In the 
March  Tankan,  the  DI  for  output  prices  for  small  enterprises,  following  that  for  large 
enterprises, has turned positive for the first time in 27 years, since 1991 (Chart 10). Thus, 
the  first  step  of  the  mechanism  is  working  steadily.  While  it  cannot  be  denied  that  the 
momentum  of  prices  is  not  yet  sufficiently  firm  compared  to  the economic expansion,  the 
year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI  excluding  fresh  food  and  energy  has  continued  to 
rise moderately since bottoming out in March 2017. 
 Next is the second step of the mechanism: whether actual price increases have led to a rise 
in  medium-  to  long-term  inflation  expectations.  In  this  regard,  recent  trends  indicate  that 
inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged, although they have moved out of 
the weakening phase (Chart 11). 
 Given  these  circumstances,  going  forward,  it  is  important  for  the  second  step  of  the 
mechanism in particular to operate more clearly toward achieving  the price stability target 
of  2  percent.  To  that  end,  it  is  necessary  for  the  first  step  to  continue  operating  amid  the 
 7 
long-lasting recovery, so that actual price increases affect people's perception of prices and 
firmly  push  up  inflation  expectations  through  the  adaptive  formation  mechanism.  Going 
forward,  if  firms  and  households  become  increasingly  confident  that  improvements  in 
economic  activity  and  prices  are  not  temporary,  the  mindset  and  behavior  based  on  the 
assumption  that  wages  and  prices  will  not  increase  will  change  and  inflation  expectations 
will rise firmly. The spread of base pay increases in the past few years can be regarded as an 
indication  of  such  change.  If  people's  deflationary  mindset  changes,  the  forces  that  let 
inflation  expectations  converge  to  the  2  percent  target  that  the  Bank  is  committed  to 
achieving  --  that  is,  the  operation  of  the  forward-looking  formation  mechanism  --  will 
become much stronger. 
 Risks to Prices 
Regarding  the  aforementioned  baseline  scenario  of  the  outlook  for  prices,  the  Bank's 
assessment  is  that  risks  are  skewed  to  the  downside.  For  example,  if  there  is  strong 
uncertainty  about  future  growth,  firms  will  hesitate  to  raise  wages  in  view  of  increasing 
employment to expand their business. In that case, the pace of increase in actual wages and 
prices -- that is, the operation of the first step of the inflation mechanism -- may be weaker 
than  expected.  Moreover,  even  if  firms'  wage-  and  price-setting  stance  becomes  more 
proactive, inflation expectations may not rise smoothly; in other words, the second step of 
the mechanism may not operate fully. Past experience suggests that there is a certain time 
lag before actual inflation affects inflation expectations and the length of this lag is highly 
uncertain.  So  far,  there  has  not  been  enough  academic  literature  on  the  learning  process 
through which firms and households revise their inflation expectations upward when faced 
with actual price rises. Taking into consideration that the experience of 15 years of deflation 
had become deeply entrenched in people's mindset and behavior, we need to keep in mind 
that  it  might  take  a  fair  amount  of  time  before  actual  inflation  starts  to  affect  inflation 
expectations. 
 Thus,  in  a  situation  where  there  are  various  risks  and  uncertainty  is  high,  with  a  view  to 
making an assessment of the outlook for prices and being accountable for this, it would not 
be proper -- and not represent adequate information dissemination by the Bank  -- to attract 
excessive  attention  merely  to  forecast  figures.  As  also  highlighted  by  Federal  Reserve 
 8 
Chairman  Powell,  it  is  difficult  to  make  accurate  forecasts  about  future  economic 
developments,  and  too  much  emphasis  should  not  be  placed  on  the  medians  of  board 
members'  forecasts.  Regarding  the  timing  of  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI 
reaching  around  2  percent,  up  until  the  previous  January  2018  Outlook  Report,  the  Bank 
provided specific descriptions such as that this would likely be around fiscal 2019; however, 
the latest report does not include such descriptions. The Bank believes that giving a detailed 
and articulate explanation on price developments based on a comprehensive assessment -- 
including  the  mechanism  through  which  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI 
increases  toward  2  percent  and  the  assessment  of  risks  --  leads  to  more  appropriate 
communication to the public. 
 III. The Conduct of Monetary Policy 
Let  me  now  turn  to  the  Bank's  conduct  of  monetary  policy.  The  Bank  has  been  pursuing 
powerful  monetary  easing  with  a  view  to  achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent. 
Specifically,  under  the  framework  of  "QQE  with  Yield  Curve  Control"  introduced  in 
September  2016,  it  facilitates  the  formation  of  the  yield  curve  that  is  considered  most 
appropriate  for  achieving  the  2  percent  target  judged  on  the  basis  of  developments  in 
economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. At the MPM held at the end of 
last  month,  the  Bank  maintained  the  guideline  for  market  operations,  in  which  the 
short-term policy interest rate is set at minus 0.1 percent and the target level of the 10-year 
Japanese government bond (JGB) yields at around zero percent. 
 The thinking behind this conduct of monetary policy is as follows. First of all, taking a look 
at developments in economic activity and prices, the economy has been improving steadily, 
but prices have not yet been sufficiently firm compared to the degree of improvement in the 
economy, as I mentioned earlier, and thus there is still a long way to go to achieve the price 
stability target of 2 percent. Downside risks to prices also warrant attention. Therefore, from 
the  perspective  of  developments  in  economic  activity  and  prices,  it  is  necessary  for  the 
Bank to continue to pursue powerful monetary easing in line with the current guideline for 
market operations. 
  9 
Next,  I  would  like  to  talk  about  the  assessment  of  financial  conditions.  In  the  conduct  of 
monetary policy, it is necessary to pay attention to both signs of overheating where financial 
imbalances build up and the stability of the financial system is impaired, as well as signs of 
a gradual pullback, in which financial institutions' profit environment deteriorates and their 
financial intermediation functioning declines. Regarding overheating, there is no sign so far 
of  excessively  bullish  expectations  in  asset  markets  or  in  the  activities  of  financial 
institutions.  As  for  risks  of  a  gradual  pullback  in  financial  intermediation,  it  has  been 
pointed out that powerful monetary easing including negative interest rates affects financial 
institutions' profits and the functioning of financial intermediation, for example by reducing 
lending margins. Going forward, attention needs to be paid to the possibility that, if the low 
interest rate environment continues and downward pressure on financial institutions' profits 
becomes prolonged, this may have a cumulative effect on their financial  strength and, as a 
result,  the  functioning  of  financial  intermediation  may  be  undermined.  However,  because 
Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, the Bank judges that there is no 
critical  problem  at  this  point  in  the  functioning  of  financial  intermediation  due  to  a 
deterioration in profits. This is also evidenced by financial institutions' continued proactive 
lending attitudes (Chart 12). 
 These  examinations  indicate  that,  at  present,  the  yield  curve  that  the  Bank  is  currently 
aiming at is sufficiently effective in stimulating economic activity and prices while avoiding 
a negative impact on financial intermediation; in other words, the Bank judges the current 
yield curve to be the most appropriate for maintaining the momentum toward achieving the 
price stability target of 2 percent. 
 When  examining  developments  in  economic  activity  and  prices  as  well  as  financial 
conditions under the framework of "QQE with Yield Curve Control," it is important to  pay 
attention  to  the  difference  between  real  and  nominal  interest  rates.  When  assessing  the 
extent  to  which  interest  rates  stimulate  economic  activity  and  prices,  it  is  essential  to 
consider  the  level  of  real  interest  rates,  which  is  calculated  by  subtracting  inflation 
expectations  from  nominal  interest  rates.  Looking  ahead,  if  real  interest  rates  decline  as 
inflation  expectations  rise,  the  stimulative  effect  on  economic  activity  and  prices  will 
become  stronger.  In  addition,  as  the  potential  growth  rate  of  the  economy  rises  with 
 10 
progress in implementation of the government's growth strategy and firms' continued efforts 
toward  improving  productivity,  the  natural  rate  of  interest  is  projected  to  rise,  and  this  is 
expected  to  enhance  monetary  easing  effects.  Going  forward,  the  Bank  will  continue  to 
pursue  powerful  monetary  easing  while  taking  advantage  of  this  mechanism  embedded  in 
the  framework  of  "QQE  with  Yield  Curve  Control"  in  order  to  achieve  the  price  stability 
target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time. 
 Lastly,  I  would  like  to  make  one  more  point.  As  mentioned  earlier,  the  Bank  has  been 
conducting  monetary  policy  while  examining  whether  the  momentum  toward  2  percent 
inflation  is  being  maintained,  taking  into  account  developments  in  economic  activity  and 
prices as well as financial conditions. The Bank has not set a specific deadline for achieving 
2 percent inflation and does not conduct monetary policy with such a deadline in mind. The 
latest  Outlook  Report  does  not  include  a  description  on  the  projected  timing  of  reaching 
around 2 percent inflation, and this partly aims to clarify this policy stance. Nevertheless, I 
would  like  to  stress  that  this  does  not  mean  that  the  significance  or  nature  of  the  price 
stability  target  has  changed.  Since  the  introduction  of  QQE  in  2013,  the  Bank  has 
committed  itself  to  achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent  at  the  earliest  possible 
time  and  continued  to  conduct  large-scale  monetary  easing  to  underpin  this  commitment. 
Clearly  demonstrating  this  determination  is  indispensable  in  changing  the  deflationary 
mindset that had become entrenched among people. The commitment to achieving 2 percent 
inflation at the earliest possible time has not changed. 
 Conclusion 
Today,  I  have  talked  about  Japan's  economic  and  price  developments  and  the  Bank's 
conduct of monetary policy. Over the past five years, Japan's economic  activity and prices 
have  improved  significantly,  and  are  proceeding  along  a  steady  path  toward  achieving  the 
price  stability  target  of  2  percent.  In  that  sense,  QQE  certainly  has  been  producing  its 
intended effects. 
 On the other hand, it has become apparent that people's deflationary mindset is more deeply 
entrenched  than  expected,  and  that  changing  such  mindset  will  take  time.  To  make  this 
happen,  the  current  virtuous  cycle  of  the  economy  --  in  which  the  inflation  rate  gradually 
 11
