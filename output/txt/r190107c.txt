Japan's Economic and Price Developments 
and Future Prospects 
Speech at the Meeting of Councillors of Nippon Keidanren 
(Japan Business Federation) in Tokyo 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
It  is  a  great  honor  to  have  this  opportunity  to  address  such  a  distinguished  gathering  of 
business leaders in Japan today. 
 This is the sixth time I have the occasion to give a speech here wrapping up the year. Today, 
I  would  first  like  to  talk  about  the  Bank  of  Japan's  view  on  domestic  economic  and  price 
developments while looking back on the past six years. Next, I will elaborate on efforts that 
firms have made so far toward improving productivity, mainly in response to labor shortage, 
and will then outline future prospects. Lastly, I will explain the Bank's conduct of monetary 
policy. 
 I. Japan's Economic and Price Developments 
Economic and Price Developments over the Past Six Years 
Let  me  start  by  looking  back  at  developments  in  Japan's  economy.  The  economy  has 
improved  significantly  over  the  past  six  years  or  so  since  2013  (Chart  1).  The  current 
economic  recovery  phase,  which  began  in  December  2012,  is  likely  to  have  reached  71 
consecutive months this October. If this recovery continues, this month it will match the 73 
months of the longest post-war recovery on record. Furthermore, looking at the output gap, 
which shows the utilization of capital and labor, demand clearly started to exceed supply in 
late  2016  and  the  output  gap  has  continued  to  widen  steadily  within  positive  territory  for 
about two years since then. 
 In  addition  to  this  long  duration,  a  significant  feature  of  the  current  economic  recovery 
phase is that the economic expansion is well-balanced in that it is not led only by a specific 
sector. Looking at business sentiment by industry in the previous prolonged recovery phase 
in  the  mid-2000s, improvement  in  the  economy  as  a  whole  was  driven  by  certain  parts  of 
the  manufacturing  sector  --  such  as  automobiles  and  production  machinery  --  against  the 
background  of  favorable  developments  in  exports  (Chart  2).  On  the  other  hand,  business 
sentiment in  sectors  such  as  construction  and  retailing  did  not  improve  clearly  throughout 
the  recovery  phase.  Thus,  the  degree  of  improvement  in  business  sentiment  differed 
substantially across industries. In contrast, in the current recovery phase, business sentiment 
has  improved  evenly  across  almost  all  industries  in  both  the  manufacturing  and  the 
 1 
nonmanufacturing  sector.  The  well-balanced  nature  of  the  recovery  is  also  confirmed  by 
developments in business conditions by firm size (Chart 3). In the past few years, business 
sentiment  has  clearly  improved  not  only  among  large  firms  but  also  small  and 
medium-sized firms. This contrasts with the situation in the previous recovery phase, when 
the degree of improvement differed significantly between the two. In terms of developments 
by  region,  too,  the current  economic  recovery  does  not center only  on  major  metropolitan 
areas.  The  active  job  openings-to-applicants  ratios  in  local  areas  have  substantially 
exceeded  the  levels  seen during  the  bubble  period and  show  improvements comparable to 
those in major metropolitan areas. 
 One of the reasons for this well-balanced economic recovery is the growth in demand in a 
wide  range  of  fields.  For  example,  looking  at  developments  in  external  demand,  the 
previous recovery phase was characterized by notable growth in exports of goods (Chart 4). 
On  the  other  hand,  in  the  current  recovery  phase,  exports  not  only  of  goods  but  also  of 
services  have  increased,  led  by  demand  from  inbound  tourism  as  well  as  royalties  and 
license  fees  from  the  overseas  operations  of  Japanese  firms,  while  growth  in  external 
demand as a whole has been moderate. Specifically, the increase in demand from inbound 
tourism  has  provided  new  business  opportunities  for  a  wide  range  of  firms,  regardless  of 
their  region  or  size.  In  addition,  looking  at  a  breakdown  of  fixed  capital  formation  in  the 
previous recovery phase, machinery investment increased against the background of growth 
in exports, while investment in structures such as buildings decreased significantly (Chart 5). 
In  the  current  recovery  phase,  investment  in  both  machinery  and  structures  has  been 
increasing.  Of  these  two,  the  increase  in  investment  in  structures  is  largely  attributable  to 
the diversification in investment demand as a result of (1) increases in housing and public 
investment, (2) investment in office buildings accompanying urban redevelopment projects, 
(3)  the  construction  of  large  distribution  centers  in  response  to  the  rapid  growth  in  online 
shopping, and (4) growing demand for the construction of accommodation facilities to meet 
demand from inbound tourism. 
 Let  me  now  talk  about  price  developments  in  Japan  over  the  past  six  years.  The 
year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) excluding fresh food  turned 
positive in mid-2013 and temporarily rose to 1.5 percent in spring 2014.  However, it then 
 2 
flattened  and  subsequently  turned  negative,  mainly  due  to  the  significant  decline  in  crude 
oil prices (Chart 6). Yet, from around late 2016, the CPI started to increase moderately again 
in  line  with  the  output  gap  turning  positive,  and  recently  has  been  around  1  percent.  The 
year-on-year rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh food and energy, which more clearly 
shows the underlying trend in prices, has  generally  continued to be positive for more than 
five  years  since  mid-2013.  Although  the  CPI  has  continued  to  show  relatively  weak 
developments  compared  to  the  economic  expansion  and  the  labor  market  tightening,  the 
economy at least no longer has been in deflation over the past few  years in the sense of a 
sustained decline in prices. 
 Recent Economic Developments and Risks concerning Overseas Economies 
As I just outlined, Japan's economic activity and prices have improved significantly over the 
past six years. Currently,  the economy is continuing its moderate expansion. Although the 
real  GDP  growth  rate  for  the  July-September  quarter  of  2018  was  negative  on  a 
quarter-on-quarter  basis,  this  likely  is  mainly  because  of  the  series  of  natural  disasters, 
which  temporarily  have  exerted  downward  pressure  on  such  components  as  exports, 
production, and tourism. In fact, looking at developments since October, these components 
have started to increase again after the decline in the July-September quarter (Chart 7). 
 As for the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue its moderate expansion. Regarding 
this outlook, however, it is necessary to bear in mind that uncertainties have recently been 
growing,  mainly  with  respect  to  developments  in  overseas  economies.  In  particular,  it  is 
necessary  to  pay  close  attention  to  recent  protectionist  moves,  including  the  trade  friction 
between  the  United  States  and  China.  While  the  results  of  the  recent  Tankan  (Short-Term 
Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) show that the impact of this problem on Japan's 
economy  so  far  likely  has  been  limited,  some  firms  have  voiced  that  it  is  difficult  to 
accurately  gauge  the  potential  impact  at  this  point  given  that  economies  have  become 
increasingly  interdependent  through  global  supply  chains.  Protectionist  policies  clearly  do 
not benefit any economy, and it is likely that a brake will be put on excessive protectionist 
moves  at  some  point.  However,  if  we  regard  this  problem  of  trade  friction  as  part  of  the 
broader issue of determining the future relationship between the United States and China, it 
is undeniable that resolving the trade friction may take time. In this case, there is also a risk 
 3 
that  the  impact  of  this  problem  on  trade  activities  and  economic  activities  in  various 
economies  could  become  complex  and  broad-based,  and  that,  depending  on  future 
developments,  the  negative  impact  could  be  amplified  through  a  deterioration  in  business 
sentiment and instability in financial markets. Attention also needs to be paid to other risks 
originating from overseas economies such as the possibility that the United Kingdom could 
end up with a no-deal Brexit, the possibility that policy rate hikes in the United States could 
lead to capital outflows from emerging economies, and various geopolitical risks including 
those in the Middle East. Although the Chinese economy has continued to see stable growth 
on  the  whole,  relatively  weak  developments  have  been  observed  in  part,  as  seen  in  the 
recent  deceleration  in  the  pace  of  improvement  in  business  sentiment  in  the  country's 
manufacturing sector. Whether this is due to the effects of the trade friction or  a slowdown 
in domestic demand resulting from factors such as deleveraging is something that needs to 
be investigated. 
 Meanwhile,  the  stock  market  has  continued  to  be  somewhat  unstable.  The  fluctuations  in 
the stock market are likely to be partly attributable to changes in perception of the various 
risk  factors  surrounding  the  global  economy  that  I  mentioned  earlier.  The  Bank  will 
continue to carefully examine developments in global financial markets and in the various 
underlying risk factors. 
 II. Efforts toward Improving Productivity 
Robustness of the Economy 
As just explained, there are various risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity. As 
I  will  elaborate  later,  however,  the  robustness  of  the  domestic  and  overseas  economies  to 
shocks appears to have increased. One of the reasons for this is the efforts made by firms so 
far, and I think that it is necessary for these efforts to continue further. Let me now focus on 
the  efforts  that  firms  have  made  so  far  toward  improving  productivity  and  outline  how 
continuing  improvement  in  productivity  can  be  expected  to  boost  the  growth  potential  of 
Japan's  economy  and  also  address  structural  challenges  such  as  the  declining  and  aging 
population. 
  4 
At  this  meeting  exactly  a  year  ago,  I  brought  up  the  problem  of  labor  shortage  and 
mentioned that Japan's economy can be expected to overcome this constraint and continue 
to  grow.  Firms  have  been  making  substantial  progress  so  far  in  this  regard.  Amid  the 
tightening of labor market conditions in the past few years, many firms have been actively 
undertaking  labor-saving  and  efficiency-improving  investment  and  streamlining  business 
processes  to  establish  more  efficient  business  operations.  These  efforts  have  been  boosted 
by the technological progress especially in information technology in recent years, as seen 
in the significant increase in software investment in  sectors such as construction, retailing, 
as well as accommodations, eating and drinking services, where labor shortage is becoming 
acute (Chart 8). 
 As  just  seen,  positive  efforts  to  improve  labor  productivity  in  response  to  the  recent 
tightening of labor market conditions are spreading among many firms in Japan. However, 
quite  a  few  firms  have  voiced  doubt  over  the  sustainability  of  economic  growth  going 
forward. Even though the longest economic recovery in the post-war era has been achieved 
and demand has increased to such a degree that firms suffer from labor shortage more acute 
than  during  the  bubble  period,  not  a  few  firms  have  expressed  cautious  views  about  the 
future. The recent increase in uncertainties surrounding overseas economies likely has led to 
a  more  cautious  sentiment  among  firms  to  some  extent.  In  addition,  there  is  also  a 
possibility  that  the  experience  of  prolonged  low  growth  and  deflation  makes  such 
uncertainties appear greater. However, there is no need to fall into excessive pessimism for 
reasons I will now explain. 
 First,  let  us  take  a  look  at  overseas  economies.  Despite  various  risks,  overseas  economies 
have  continued  to  grow  firmly  on  the  whole,  with  domestic  demand  in  many  economies 
continuing on an increasing trend. In the World Economic Outlook (WEO) released by the 
International Monetary  Fund (IMF) in October, although forecasts were somewhat revised 
downward  from  the  previous  ones  released  in  July,  the  annual  real  GDP  growth  rates  for 
2018  and  2019  are  both  projected  to  be  3.7  percent,  continuing  to  mark  relatively  high 
growth close to the peak registered since the global financial crisis (Chart 9). As for the U.S. 
economy,  prospects  for  the  long-term  growth  potential  have  improved  compared  to  some 
time  ago.  Another  important  point  is  that  no  overheating  of  the  economy  or  notable 
 5 
financial  imbalances  have  been  observed.  Although  the  economic  recovery  of  the  United 
States  has  continued  for  more  than  110  consecutive  months,  which  is  longer  than  Japan's 
current  recovery  phase,  so  far  no  signs  of  the  spread  of  a  bubble  can  be  detected.  This  is 
partly  because  the  pace  of  growth  has  been  moderate  during  this  period  and  various 
financial regulations based on lessons learned from the global financial crisis have been put 
in place. Given these observations, the continuing stable growth of the U.S. economy -- the 
growth  engine  of  the  global  economy  --  provides  substantial  grounds  for  confidence  in 
Japan's economy as well. 
 Second, the diversification of growth sectors of Japan's economy is also an important factor 
enhancing  the  robustness  of  the  economy.  I  mentioned  earlier  that  services  exports  have 
made  a  substantial  contribution  to  growth  in  external  demand,  while  investment  in 
structures  has  significantly  contributed  to  growth  in  fixed  capital  formation,  and  such 
well-balanced growth is likely to raise the resilience of Japan's economy to future shocks. 
 Third,  a  point  worth  mentioning  is  that  the  profitability  of  Japanese  firms  has  improved. 
Even more than the level of corporate profits, what is important in this context is the nature 
of these profits. While corporate profits have been improving over the past six years, until 
around 2016, the main reason was the decline in crude oil prices. Meanwhile, sales volumes 
did  not  increase  very  much  and  turnover  also  remained  more  or  less  flat  (Chart  10).  It  is 
said  that  profit  improvements  taking  this  form  are  unlikely  to  spur  active  and 
forward-looking behavior such as increases in business fixed investment. However, over the 
past two years or so, the nature of the improvements in profits has changed in that they have 
been accompanied by increases in sales volumes and turnover. This indicates that firms can 
have greater confidence in their profits, which is more likely to lead to increases in business 
fixed investment. 
 Future Prospects 
Based on the observations I just highlighted, even if there were some kind of shock, Japan's 
economy and the global economy likely are sufficiently robust to withstand it. Under these 
circumstances,  with  firms  continuing  to  actively  make  efforts  toward  improving 
productivity,  it  can  be  expected  that  the  various  concerns  will  be  gradually  resolved  as 
 6 
Japan's  economy  continues  to  grow  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Needless  to  say,  labor 
productivity is defined as the value added per unit of labor input and represents the earning 
power per worker or unit of labor input such as the hourly labor input. As can be seen from 
this definition, raising labor productivity can be divided into two parts: efforts to save labor 
input, which is the denominator; and efforts to increase value added, which is the numerator. 
As  I  mentioned  earlier,  in  the  past  few  years,  Japanese  firms  have  made  efforts  to  reduce 
labor  input  through  such  measures  as  labor-saving  investment, reflecting  the  tightening  of 
labor  market  conditions.  Such  efforts  have  been  particularly  pronounced  in  the 
nonmanufacturing  sector,  where 
there  remains  substantial  room  for  productivity 
improvements compared to other economies. In fact, Japan is exhibiting the highest pace of 
growth  in  labor  productivity  among  G7  countries  (Chart  11).  In  order  to  further  improve 
labor productivity, it is important to  increase value added, which is the numerator of labor 
productivity.  To  this  end,  it  is  necessary  to  further  create  and  exploit  potential  demand. 
Examples  of  the  successful  creation  of  new  demand  are  provided  by  products  in  which 
Japan  has  an  advantage  such  as  cosmetics  or  sake  (rice  wine).  Domestic  sales  of  these 
products to tourists visiting Japan have led to repeat sales abroad when the tourists returned 
home,  leading  to  an  increase  in  turnover.  In  addition,  the  diversification  and  advances  in 
housekeeping  services,  security  services,  and  household  electrical  appliances  can  be 
regarded as creating demand stemming from the rapid increase in dual-working and senior 
households. Furthermore, new technologies such as rapidly advancing artificial intelligence 
(AI) and big data are likely to be powerful tools to exploit potential demand that otherwise 
cannot be captured. For example, the development of new means of transportation through 
self-driving  systems  and  the  provision  of  preventive  medical  services  using  real-time  data 
of  people's  health  condition  have  been  attracting  attention  as  businesses  with  future 
potential that did not exist before. 
 Naturally, there is no specific method to create and exploit potential demand, and it can be 
said that innovative efforts play an important role. One of the things needed to this end is 
securing imaginative and creative human capital. While there are a number of key points to 
securing  human  capital  --  such  as  creating  appropriate  work  environments  including  via 
working-style  reforms  --  increasing  wages  through  sustainable  productivity  improvements 
is  another  important  point.  Pushing  ahead  with  labor-saving  investment  in  response  to  the 
 7 
labor  shortage  ultimately  is  likely  to  help  to  grasp  opportunities  to  capture  new  demand 
through increasing wages and securing superior human capital. 
 For  firms  engaged  in  creating  and  exploiting  such  potential  demand,  the  government's 
growth  strategy  and  structural  reforms  offer  great  opportunities.  The  Bank  is  actively 
supporting  firms'  investment  activities  by  maintaining  highly  accommodative  financial 
conditions through powerful monetary easing. I would like firms to take advantage of this 
excellent  environment  and  continue  to  pursue  efforts  toward  improving  productivity.  The 
ultimate  driver  of  economic  growth  is  the  animal  spirit  of  firms.  We  hope  to  achieve 
sustainable  growth  of  Japan's  economy  as  a  whole,  with  the  government,  the  Bank,  and 
firms working together as one. 
 III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy 
Lastly, I will talk about the Bank's monetary policy. 
 As stipulated by the Bank of Japan Act, the Bank's monetary policy conduct "shall be aimed 
at  achieving  price  stability,  thereby  contributing  to  the  sound  development  of  the  national 
economy." Based on this, the Bank has set a price stability target of 2 percent and conducts 
monetary  policy  with  the  aim  of  creating  a  virtuous  cycle  in  the  economy  in  which  the 
inflation  rate  rises  moderately  along  with  increases  in  corporate  profits,  employment,  and 
wages.  While  the  government's  growth  strategy  and  flexible  fiscal  policy  should  provide 
strong support to achieve such sustainable economic growth, the Bank's stance to fulfill its 
role  and  do  its  utmost  to  achieve  the  price  stability  target  has  remained  and  will  remain 
unchanged. 
 Of course, as experience shows, the economic and price situation can change as a result of a 
range of factors. Therefore, in fulfilling its mandate, the Bank needs to pursue the monetary 
policy that is most appropriate to the situation at the time while weighing up its benefits and 
costs.  This  view  is  held  not  only  by  the  Bank  of  Japan  but  is  shared  by  central  banks 
worldwide and will not change regardless of the kind of policy measures adopted. 
  8 
When  the  Bank  introduced  quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary  easing  (QQE)  six  years 
ago,  Japan's  economy  was  not  recovering  and  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI 
was negative, far from the price stability target of 2 percent. Under these circumstances, the 
benefits of adopting bold monetary easing measures significantly outweighed the costs. The 
Bank  therefore  judged  it  appropriate  to  take  drastic  measures  focusing  on  achieving  the 
price  stability  target  of  2  percent  at  the  earliest  possible  time  and  embarked  on  bold 
measures  that  were  substantially  different  from  those  in  the  past,  such  as  the  significant 
expansion of the monetary base. 
 Such  powerful  monetary  easing  likely  played  a  role  in  the  substantial  improvement  of 
Japan's  economy.  On  the  price  front,  the  economy  already  is  no  longer  in  deflation  in  the 
sense  of  a  sustained  decline  in  prices.  However,  prices  have  continued  to  show  relatively 
weak developments compared to the economic expansion and the labor market tightening, 
and it is still taking time to achieve the price stability target. Moreover, recently, downside 
risks  mainly  regarding  overseas  economies  have  come  to  warrant  further attention.  In  this 
somewhat complicated situation, what is required is to persistently continue with the current 
powerful  monetary  easing  while  taking  account  of  both  the  positive  effects  and  the  side 
effects -- that is, the benefits and costs -- of monetary easing in a balanced manner. This is 
exactly the kind of situation in which policy sustainability and durability is important. 
 Let me elaborate. In terms of positive effects, it is necessary to maintain a positive output 
gap -- a driver for inflation -- for as long as possible under the current framework of "QQE 
with  Yield  Curve  Control"  and  thereby  firmly  sustain  the  momentum  toward  2  percent 
inflation.  At  the  July  Monetary  Policy  Meeting  (MPM),  the  Bank  introduced  forward 
guidance for policy rates and made clear that it would "maintain the current extremely low 
levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time." This is  also a 
measure  that  clarifies  the  Bank's  policy  stance  of  continuing  with  the  current  powerful 
monetary easing. 
 On the other hand, in order to strengthen the sustainability and durability of  this powerful 
monetary easing, the side effects of the policy also warrant attention. In the first half of this 
year, it was pointed out that the functioning of the Japanese government bond (JGB) market 
 9 
had  deteriorated  under  the  Bank's  large-scale  JGB  purchases,  as  seen,  for  example,  in 
somewhat rigid interest rate formation. Therefore, at the July MPM, the Bank also decided 
to conduct market operations and asset purchases in a more flexible manner. As a result, the 
degree of market functioning has improved, with JGB yields moving upward and downward 
again in tandem with stock prices and U.S. interest rates. In addition, the Bank is aware that 
prolonged  downward  pressure  on  financial  institutions'  profits,  with  the  low  interest  rate 
environment  and  severe  competition  among  financial  institutions  continuing,  could  create 
risks  of  a  gradual  pullback  in  financial  intermediation  and  of  destabilizing  the  financial 
system.  Although  these  risks  are  judged  as  not  significant  at  this  point,  mainly  because 
financial  institutions  have  sufficient  capital  bases,  it  is  necessary  to  pay  close  attention  to 
future  developments,  including  from  the  perspective  of  maintaining  policy  sustainability 
and durability. 
 As explained, the Bank will proceed step by step toward achieving the price stability target 
under  the  powerful  monetary  easing  while  taking  into  account  in  a  balanced  manner  not 
only  the  benefits  of  monetary  easing  but  also  its  costs.  It  is  likely  to  take  more  time  than 
expected  to  achieve  the  price  stability  target,  and  uncertainties  regarding  the  outlook  have 
heightened further. However, firmly maintaining the momentum toward achieving 2 percent 
inflation through such policy conduct will ultimately help to ensure the price stability target 
is  achieved  at  the  earliest  possible  time  without  putting  an  excessive  burden  on  the  real 
economy and the functioning of financial intermediation. 
 Conclusion 
It  seems  that  we  are  almost  out  of  time.  Today,  I  looked  back  on  the  economic  recovery 
over  the  past  six  years  and  talked  in  some  detail  about  firms'  efforts  toward  improving 
productivity so far and future prospects. I also touched upon the possibility that responding 
to  the  recent  labor  shortage  and  actively  proceeding  with  measures  such  as  labor-saving 
investment  will  ultimately  help  firms  to  secure  talented  human  capital  and  create  and 
exploit  new  demand.  The  Bank  will  provide  its  utmost  support  for  such  efforts  by  firms 
through maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions. 
  10 
2019 is the year of the boar in the Japanese Zodiac. While boars tend to have a reputation of 
heading to a target only in a bold way, experts say that they are brave and at the same time 
actually  are  extremely  cautious  animals.  In  2019,  the  Bank  will  continue  to  steadily  work 
toward  achieving  the  price  stability  target.  During  the  process,  it  will  thoroughly  examine 
various risks including those regarding developments in overseas economies. Although we 
should not be overly pessimistic, it is always necessary to calmly watch the surroundings. 
Based on this, the Bank will weigh up the benefits and costs of its policies and implement 
the policies most appropriate to the situation at the time. 
 In little more than four months, the Heisei era will draw to a close and make way for a new 
era.  Taking  this  juncture  as  an  opportunity  to  look  at  Japan's  economy  from  a  broader 
perspective, the impact of the prolonged deflation of the past persists in the form of cautious 
wage setting and a reluctance to accept price rises. At the same time, however, the cautious 
attitude on the part of firms and households has been dissipating slowly but steadily on the 
back of the economic expansion and tight labor market conditions over the past few years. 
In the new era that is about to start, the Bank will continue to firmly fulfill its responsibility 
as  the  central  bank  in  order  to  ensure  the  achievement  of  the  price  stability  target  and 
contribute to sustainable economic growth. 
 I would like to close my speech by expressing my sincere hope that the year 2019 will be a 
wonderful one for all of you. 
 Thank you for your attention.
