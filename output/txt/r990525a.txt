Mr Macfarlane gives an overview of the Australian economy in the 1990s
Talk  by  the  Governor  of  the  Australian  Reserve  Bank,  Mr  I  J  Macfarlane,  to  the  CLSA
Investors’ Forum in Hong Kong on 21 May 1999.
It is a pleasure to be in Hong Kong talking to the CLSA Investors’ Forum. This conference
has built up quite a reputation over the years and I am honoured to be invited to address such
an  impressive  group  of  investors.  I  will  try  my  best  to  avoid  presenting  you  with  a  “sales
pitch”, but that is easier said than done. If you think that I am concentrating too much on the
favourable side of the Australian economy, you can always redress the balance when it comes
to question time.
The Australian economy has attracted a fair bit of favourable attention lately because it has
performed  so  well  during  the  Asian  economic  and  financial  crises.  Whilst  this  favourable
publicity is very gratifying for people like myself who have been around during the lean years
as  well  as  the  good  ones,  I  do  not  intend  to  spend  much  time  today  talking  about  recent
economic events. This is because I think the good performance of the Australian economy is
not just a recent event, but something that has been unfolding over the past decade. In other
words,  the  recognition  may  be  recent,  but  the  underlying  story  has  been  around  for  a  lot
longer.
We have now nearly completed the decade of the 1990s, with nine of the ten years already
behind us. Over this period of nine years, Australia has grown faster than other comparable
OECD  countries  (Slide  1).  Only  Ireland  and  Norway,  which  taken  together  are  only  a  little
over half the size of Australia, have done better, and there are special reasons in each case.
This  is  the  first  decade  to  my  knowledge  where  Australia  has  put  in  such  a  strong  growth
performance relative to other OECD countries. While there have been other decades - such as
the  1950s  and  1960s  -  where  Australia  grew  faster  in  absolute  terms,  we  did  not  exceed
OECD average growth rates in those periods. The 1990s stands out as the first decade of the
post-war era where Australia’s growth would put it in the first quartile of performers.

I should also add, of course, that this economic growth was achieved against a background of
very low inflation. Over the same nine-year period, Australia had an average rate of inflation
of  2.8  per  cent  per  annum.  This  is  slightly  higher  than  the  average  of  OECD  countries  but
within the range of 2-3 per cent as specified in our inflation target. If we deleted the first two
years (1990 and 1991) from our comparison, our average inflation rate would fall to about the
OECD average. Of course, the thing that stands out when we look at inflation in the 1990s is
not the difference between the countries, but the uniformity in that they all have achieved very
low inflation rates.
The question I want to address today is this - why has Australia done so much better relative
to other countries in the 1990s than it had in previous decades? I will attempt to answer this
question  by  starting  with  those  aspects  of  the  economy  I  know  most  about,  namely  macro-
economic policy, and then moving on to other areas which are a little more speculative. By
doing it in this order, I do not wish to imply that improvements in macro-economic policy are
the  main  explanation.  They  may  be,  but  on  the  other  hand,  it  is  entirely  possible  that  the
biggest improvements have come from the structural side.
Macro-economic Policies
Monetary policy has been put on a much sounder footing in the 1990s than in earlier decades.
The inflation targeting regime has been a success in Australia, as it has in other countries that
have  adopted  this  approach.  The  Government’s  recognition  of  the  independence  of  the
Reserve  Bank  has  also  been  an  important  factor.  Monetary  policy  has,  in  effect,  become
depoliticised, and decisions can now be based more on medium-term considerations than in
earlier  decades.  Low  inflation,  and  the  fact  that  it  has  been  maintained  without  forgoing
economic growth, is the clearest testimony to this improvement.
Fiscal policy is also in much better shape. The Budget is in surplus and projected to stay there
during the period covered by the forward estimates. Perhaps the best medium-term measure of
a  country’s  fiscal  position  is  the  ratio  of  government  debt  to  GDP.  Instead  of  showing  one
year’s position, this measure summarises the effect of all previous years’ surpluses or deficits.
As you can see by the next slide, Australia has the lowest ratio of any OECD country, and it is
still declining.

One aspect of Australia’s recent economic performance that has received favourable comment
is the behaviour of the exchange rate. When the Asian crisis erupted, the exchange rate fell so
that at its low point in August last year it had fallen by a very significant amount. Unlike a
number of countries in the region, interest rates were not raised to defend the exchange rate. I
would like to make two observations about the exchange rate:
• 
The first is that under our floating exchange rate regime, the exchange rate is allowed to
vary quite a lot with cyclical developments in the world economy. One of the reasons
that we are comfortable with this degree of variability is that we know that it takes place
around a basically flat trend. This can be seen from Graph 1 which shows the Australian
dollar against the US dollar.

•  My second point is that some people have tended to exaggerate the size of the fall in the
Australian dollar over 1997/98 by looking only at the Australian dollar/US dollar rate.
At least half of the story over that period was US dollar strength rather than Australian
dollar  weakness.  This  is  illustrated  in  Graph  2  which  shows  the  Australian  dollar  in
trade  weighted  terms,  where  the  fall  was  much  less  pronounced.  Again,  I  would  not
want to place too much weight on this measure either, because it tends to be pushed up
by the large depreciation in a few Asian currencies. The truth probably lies somewhere
between the two.

Recent events in Asia and elsewhere have highlighted how important financial stability is in
determining  macro-economic  outcomes.  Although  there  are  many  factors  which  underlie
financial stability, one very important one is the prudential supervision of the banking system.
In  Australia,  we  learnt  quite  a  lot  about  that  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s,  and  that
learning experience has served us well over the past decade. The best single measure of this
aspect of financial stability is shown by the level of bad debts of the banking sector. As you
can see from Graph 3, these have fallen from their peak of 6 per cent in 1992 to less than 1 per
cent at present. This is about as low as they can realistically be expected to go.

Structural Policies
Turning to structural policies, I would like to start by showing a graph of productivity. This
graph  shows  the  average  increase  in  productivity  in  each  of  the  last  three  economic
expansions,  i.e.  the  1970s,  the  1980s  and  the  1990s.  The  measure  of  productivity  used  is
multi-factor  productivity.  This  measure  of  productivity  cannot  be  increased  simply  by
shedding labour and replacing it with capital. It can only be increased by using both labour
and capital more productively. As you can see from Graph 4, productivity growth  has  been
much faster in the 1990s - nearly 2 per cent per annum - than the rates of increase achieved in
earlier  expansions  -  about  1  per  cent  per  annum.  Whilst  we  cannot  draw  very  specific
conclusions  from  this  improvement,  it  seems  to  me  that  it  tells  us  that  we  must  have  been
doing something right. My guess is that the main things behind this improvement have been
the various micro-economic reforms that have been aimed at increasing the competitiveness
of the Australian economy. These include:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the privatisation of a lot of public utilities, banks, insurance companies; and
the introduction of a good deal more flexibility into wage bargaining.
the introduction of a more stringent regime for competitive policy;
the deregulation of financial markets;
the substantial lowering of tariffs;

I  think  we  made  a  lot  more  progress  in  these  areas  than  we  were  ever  given  credit  for
internationally. Each of these changes met with resistance, and  in  many  cases  compromises
were  made  which  would  not  please  the  purists.  But  taken  together,  along  with  the  private
sector restructuring that was occurring at the same time, they have amounted to a major set of
reforms, and have made the Australian economy leaner, more flexible and more competitive.

BIS Review   58/1999
Whilst these measures make the economy more efficient and competitive in the longer run,
they of course have short-run costs. There is always an increase in uncertainty in an economy
where change is occurring, and there are often job losses involved, such as when a large over-
staffed public utility is privatised. Of course, there are also enormous benefits which are often
overlooked,  such  as  cheaper  electricity,  cars,  telephone  calls,  airline  flights,  new  export
industries, etc. But because the complaints and resistance tend to receive more publicity than
the successes, the impression is given that there is a lot of resistance.
I think this is a misleading impression and that Australians are actually very adaptable people.
Some historical examples of this adaptability include:
• 
the ease with which Australia replaced the old British system of weights and measures
with the metric system (compared with the limited success the United States and United
Kingdom have had in the same endeavour); and
 the ready acceptance of such measures as random breath testing and compulsory seatbelt
wearing to reduce the road toll. These were introduced in Australia many years ago and I
think we were the first country to do so. These measures are still resisted in a number of
countries.
Another  aspect  of  this  adaptability  is  the  speed  with  which  Australians  have  taken  up  new
technology,  particularly  computer-based  communications  technology.  I  have  two  graphs  to
illustrate this. The first on modem usage per head of population, and the second on electronic
commerce servers per head of population. Both measures, not surprisingly, show the United
States, at the top of the table, but Australia is also very highly placed, coming third in modem
usage  and  second  in  electronic  commerce  servers.  In  particular,  it  is  notable  that  Australia,
along  with  Canada,  makes  considerably  greater  use  of  these  technologies  than  European
countries, for example.

Risks
The picture I have painted is, not surprisingly, a very rosy one. This is partly  because  I  am
talking to a group of international investors, but it is mainly due to the fact that the numbers
themselves have been very good ones. But the outlook cannot be perfect; every economy has
some vulnerable points. Even the Americans, who have done so well over recent years, worry
about the level of the stock market and the possibility of incipient inflationary pressures. What
are the Australian equivalents?
We  think  that  our  expansion  is  going  to  slow  down  at  some  point  because  that  is  what
business cycles do. We are still forecasting a slowdown even though our previous forecasts of
slowdowns have not eventuated. But I would hardly classify a mild slowing of the economy as
being a major problem for us. The only way we could get into a major problem on this front is
if there is an outright contraction in the world economy, and that does not seem to be a likely
outcome.
We do not think that our asset markets are over-heated, nor do we see inflationary pressures at
present. Credit growth has been very strong, but it has not interacted with asset prices as it did
in the  1980s.  That  could  all  change  in  the  future,  of  course,  but  for  the  present  this  sort  of
over-heating seems a long way off.
The usual area that people point to as a danger point for Australia is the balance of payments.
Naturally, our current account deficit has widened over the past two years. This is what you
would expect, given the buoyancy of the Australian economy and the contraction in so many
of our major export markets. This  widening  is  thus  more  a  reflection  of  the  strength  of  the
Australian economy rather than its weakness.
If you look back over the past 20 years, you will see that the Australian current account deficit
has fluctuated between about 3½ per cent and 6½ per cent of GDP. On four occasions, it has
exceeded  6  per  cent,  and  it  seems  likely  that  when  the  final  figures  come  in  for  the  March
quarter  of  1999,  this  will  have  happened  for  the  fifth  time.  In  the  past,  this  has  often  rung
7
BIS Review   58/1999
alarm bells, but it is not doing so on this occasion. Why is that so? I think there are basically
two reasons for this:

* Excludes RBA gold transactions; March 1999 estimate.
  The  first  reason  is  that  in  the  past  the  widening  current  account  deficit  was  partly  a
reflection  of  domestic  imbalances  such  as  a  large  Budget  deficit  or  a  higher  rate  of
inflation than the rest of the world. Neither of those are present on this occasion, and the
widening  current  account  deficit  can  be  fully  explained  by  differing  growth  rates
between the Australian economy and its trading partners.
The  second  reason  is  that  in  the  1980s  the  widening  current  account  deficit  raised
doubts about its sustainability. People thought that the debt to GDP ratio would keep on
rising  forever  and  that  debt  servicing  could  become  an  intolerable  burden.  Neither  of
these two eventualities occurred. As Graph 8 shows, the debt to GDP ratio stabilised at
around  40  per  cent,  which  is  high  by  world  standards  but  not  excessively  so  (for
example, New Zealand, Canada and Sweden all have higher rates). A similar story can
be  told  with  regard  to  debt  servicing  (Graph  9).  Its  ratio  as  a  percentage  of  exports
reached a peak of 20 per cent in the late 1980s, but is now less than half of that level.
In Australia, we always have to keep a weather eye on the balance of payments, but it does not
seem to represent quite the same constraint now that it did in the 1980s. Of course, it is not
really up to me to make these judgments. It is really up to the market. It does seem, however,
that the market is much more prepared to give the Australian economy the benefit of the doubt
than  it  formerly  was.  To  return  to  my  earlier  theme,  I  think  that  is  because  the  totality  of
policies in Australia are now judged much more favourably than they were in earlier  years.
Virtue does seem to have its own rewards.
