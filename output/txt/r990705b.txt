Mr  Heikensten  talks  about  the  interaction  between  monetary  and  fiscal  policy  and  labour
market developments
Speech  by  Lars  Heikensten,  First  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  the  Swedish  central
bank, to the Landskrona Municipality in Landskrona, Sweden on 16 June 1999.
For more than six years now, monetary policy in Sweden has been conducted with an inflation target.
Sweden was one of the first countries, together with Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom,
for  example,  to  adopt  an  inflation  targeting  strategy.  Other  countries  have  recently  displayed  an
interest  in  targeting  inflation  directly  as  the  guideline  for  monetary  policy.  Examples  are  countries
with strong economic growth in Asia, South America and Eastern Europe.
In many respects, Sweden’s period with an inflation target has been one  of  good  economic  results.
Inflation and interest rates have come down to levels that are historically low and growth since the
crisis in the early 1990s has been relatively high and stable. Part of the explanation is, of course, that
the recession left us with plenty of unutilised resources. But new production capacity has also been
created at a rapid rate. Moreover, inflation expectations have been lowered, which gives a new and
better  environment  for  price  and  wage  formation.  International  inflation  has  also  been  low.  The
picture of unemployment is more disappointing, though here too the recent trend points in the right
direction.

Monetary  policy,  however,  is  just  one  of  the  factors  that  are  important  for  economic  development.
Two crucial matters for economic development in general and thereby for the conditions underlying
monetary policy are the situation in the labour market and fiscal policy. In recent years it is not least
the construction of fiscal policy that has contributed to the good economic performance.
The interaction of fiscal and monetary policy has been debated a good deal of late. Income tax cuts
have been discussed, for instance. Now that Sweden’s economy seems to be moving into a stronger
phase, in large measure as a result of higher domestic activity, it is of the utmost importance that we
do not land in a situation with wage drift and overheating as a consequence of an unduly expansionary
fiscal  stance.  Against  this  background,  I  shall  be  talking  today  about  the  conditions  for  monetary
policy and its interaction with fiscal policy and labour market developments.

BIS Review   77/1999
Interaction with fiscal policy
Fiscal  policy  affects  the  chances  of  success  in  monetary  policy  in  various  ways:  via  its  impact  on
general confidence in monetary policy, via short-run effects on demand and by modifying the long-
term conditions for economic growth and low inflation.
Let me begin with credibility. If the direction of fiscal policy is perceived as being unsustainable in
the  longer  run,  economic  policy’s  overall  focus  on  low  inflation  and  stable  growth  is  liable  to  be
questioned. Few  industrialised  countries  have  experienced  this  as  recently  and  tangibly  as  Sweden.
The  massive  budget  deficits  in  the  early  1990s,  with  rapidly  accumulating  government  debt,  made
Sweden’s  economic  future  uncertain  and  pushed  interest  rates  up.  With  the  consolidation  of
government  finances,  however,  and  the  long-term  ambitions  for  fiscal  policy  that  the  Government,
supported by the Riksdag (Sweden’s Parliament), has presented, confidence has improved.
The new budget process — with a moving budget ceiling and a budget surplus of 2 per cent of GDP
as a medium-term target — means that the Government and  the  Riksdag  have  set  up  a  clear  set  of
rules to show that Sweden has no intention of relapsing into earlier habits. There is nothing fortuitous
about these rules. But the purpose of the budget ceiling and the budget target as confidence-enhancing
instruments does presuppose that they are observed consistently and continuously over the business
cycle.
Changes  in  fiscal  policy  also  affect  monetary  policy  through  their  direct  impact  on  demand.  The
debate  in  recent  weeks  has  focused  not  least  on  these  effects.  An  adjustment  of  income  tax  or  of
transfers to households alters disposable income and thereby private consumption. Similarly, a change
in  corporate  tax  or  transfers  to  firms  affects  company  profits  and  thereby  investment  and  other
economic decisions. Activity in the economy may also be affected if the government decides to spend
more on public sector consumption or investment.
This  makes  fiscal  policy  a  factor  of  importance  when  assessing  economic  activity  and  future
inflationary  pressure.  At  the  same  time,  the  changes  that  are  generated  do  not  lend  themselves  to
mechanical calculations. Part of the reason is that the path of inflation is determined by other factors
besides fiscal policy.
A third important aspect of fiscal policy’s interaction with inflation has to do with fiscal effects on
potential output. Lower tax on  productive  capital  or  companies  may  lead  to  more  companies  being
established and thereby raise potential output. Similarly, lower tax on labour or increased educational
inputs  may  generate  an  increased  supply  of  labour  and  also  influence  wage  formation.  These  are
examples of the numerous ways in which changes in tax and expenditure systems are likely to modify
economic  opportunities  and  promote  conditions  for  good  growth  without  the  attendant  capacity
shortages that generate price pressure.
Current fiscal policy
The trade-off between monetary and fiscal policy — the policy mix, as we economists like to say —
has improved considerably in the present decade.
The rapid accumulation of government debt has ceased and the stock is now being reduced. While the
consolidation of  government  finances  has  made  the  fiscal  stance  restrictive,  it  has  been  possible  to
lower  interest  rates  and  this  in  turn  has  stimulated  investment,  economic  activity  and  employment
lately. This is accordingly a considerable improvement compared with the early 1990s, for example,
when factors such as very weak government finances led the Riksbank to keep interest rates up at a
time when government debt was rising markedly.

In the June Inflation Report we noted that as a result of measures proposed in the Budget Bill, during
1999 and possibly also in 2000 fiscal policy would probably be more restrictive  than  the  Riksbank
had assumed earlier but would still become successively more expansionary. The restrictive economic
effect of fiscal policy was accordingly judged to be less marked than in the period 1994 – 97.
Our  scenario  assumed,  however,  that  there  would  be  no  further  tax  cuts  next  year.  We  foresee  a
government financial surplus somewhat above 2 per cent of GDP but have thus assumed that it will be
used to repay government debt. In 2001, on the other hand, we assume that any surplus in excess of 2
per cent of GDP will be transferred to households.
The  Swedish  debate  about  tax  cuts  and  increased  spending  has  become  more  intense  as  the
government budget moved out of the red and is expected to show continued and growing surpluses in
the years ahead. That is hardly surprising. We had exactly the same debate in the 1980s as soon as the
budget deficits had been eliminated. Some comments are therefore called for.
One comment concerns the formulation of the budget target. A medium-term average implies that in
good years the surplus should be above 2 per cent and by most standards the coming years must be
regarded as good. While the economy does admittedly still appear to have some unutilised resources,
they will gradually be utilised. Maintaining a surplus above 2 per cent when activity is high means
that  a  smaller  surplus  can  be  tolerated  when  activity  is  lower.  In  this  way,  room  is  created  for  the
budget to act as an automatic stabiliser. If, instead, the surplus is held mechanically at exactly 2 per
cent  from  year  to  year,  fiscal  policy  will  tend  to  accentuate  cyclical  fluctuations  and  exert  a
destabilising effect.
Another comment concerns the demand effects of an easier fiscal stance in the present situation. The
tax changes being discussed seem largely to be unfinanced income tax reductions for low and medium
income groups. Judging from what has been indicated to date, a corresponding adjustment of public
spending is not envisaged. In that case, the tax cuts would  enlarge  household  income  and  raise  the
level  of  economic  activity  via  increased  consumption.  That  could  result  in  increased  inflationary
pressure that monetary policy might need to counter.
That said, I want to underscore that tax cuts may well be motivated. There are many indications that
the  Swedish  economy  would  work  better  if  taxes  were  lower.  Moreover,  with  the  growing
international  exchange  in  almost  every  economic  domain,  maintaining  taxes  in  Sweden  at  a  higher
3
BIS Review   77/1999
level than in the rest of the world will become increasingly difficult. But there is reason to deliberate
the type of tax cuts that would benefit the Swedish economy most in connection with good growth.
Tax reductions with positive supply-side effects — instead of the cuts being discussed, which mainly
stimulate demand — would increase the possibilities of combining the good growth with persistently
low inflation.

Interaction with labour market trends
Let me now leave monetary policy’s interaction with fiscal policy and consider its relationship with
the situation in the labour market. What forms does this interaction take?
Monetary  policy’s  chief  contribution  to  employment  lies  in  the  creation  of  economic  stability  and
clear  rules  for  wage  formation.  A  monetary  policy  that  is  predictable  and  operates  with  a  clear
inflation  target  provides  good  guidance  for  wage  negotiations.  The  lack  of  a  properly  functioning
stabilisation policy was presumably one reason why wage formation did not work in the 1970s and
1980s. The rules of the game were unclear to the labour market organisations. That is hardly the case
today, as the Trade Union Confederation, for example, has acknowledged. Their wage negotiations in
1997 started, in fact, from the 2 per cent inflation target.
In the assessment of future inflationary pressure, monetary policy in turn must take the labour market
situation into account. Wages are of major economic importance: in that the wage bill accounts for
almost 70 per cent of value added, the development of wages has a large impact on costs and thus on
price formation. Moreover, wage settlements are liable to influence inflation expectations.
Wage tendencies are therefore one of the principal variables in any assessment of inflation. However,
the difficulties in forecasting wage trends are considerable. The Riksbank does, of course, follow data
on  wages  and  unit  labour  costs;  other  important  indicators  include  labour  shortages  in  particular
industries, wage drift, registered and total unemployment in relation to job vacancies.
A  central  concept  in  this  context  is  equilibrium  unemployment,  often  referred  to  by  the  English
acronym NAIRU—the level of unemployment that can be combined with stable inflation. Attempts to
push unemployment down below the NAIRU with monetary stimuli are liable to have the sole effect
BIS Review   77/1999

of boosting inflation. In other words, the NAIRU is not responsive to an expansionary stabilisation
policy. It depends instead on the workings of the labour market, together with demographic changes
and  technology.  Thus,  lastingly  higher  employment  cannot  be  generated  by  continuously
implementing an expansionary monetary policy. This is a basic tenet of economics, yet to judge from
the public debate it still seems to be misunderstood.
Various attempts have been made to estimate the NAIRU for Sweden. If this could be done with some
certainty,  it  would  obviously  be  of  interest.  Insights  into  when  a  reduction  of  unemployment  risks
boosting inflation would be a useful guide for monetary policy. The matter is unfortunately not that
simple, mainly because equilibrium unemployment is something that cannot be observed directly.

Assessing the level of the NAIRU for Sweden is presumably particularly difficult at present. We still
do  not  know  all  that  much  about  the  long-term  consequences  of  all  that  has  happened  in  the  past
decade. After fluctuating around a low level for decades, possibly with a slight upward trend, with the
crisis  in  the  early  1990s,  unemployment  shot  up  in  just  a  few  years.  Moreover,  policy  has  been
realigned and focused successfully on low inflation. This is likely to influence wage formation and
hence the NAIRU.
It is notable that problems have also been encountered recently in estimating the level of the NAIRU
for the United States. Yet the adjustment to low inflation occurred there back around the turn of the
1970s. For some time now, US unemployment has been below the rate that an earlier rule of thumb
identified as the equilibrium level but inflation has not accelerated. Some explain this mainly in terms
of favourable transitory effects, while others attribute it to more far-reaching changes of a structural
nature.  In  any  event,  the  US  example  shows  that  drawing  conclusions  about  the  NAIRU  can  be
difficult even in economies where unemployment has remained close to a level that is comparatively
constant.
In the Riksbank’s work, estimates of the NAIRU are accompanied by, for example, calculations of the
output  gap,  which  aim  to  provide  a  picture  of  total  capacity  utilisation.  The  output  gap  is  the
difference between current production and the economy’s long-term production capacity or potential
GDP. Like the NAIRU, the latter equilibrium level is not directly observable and therefore has to be
estimated  with  statistical  methods.  The  equilibrium  level  of  output  and  the  NAIRU  evidently  have
5
BIS Review   77/1999
points in common. The situation in the labour market must be a central aspect of any assessment of
total capacity utilisation.

While good forecasts of inflation can be made without knowing the exact levels of potential GDP and
the NAIRU, for those of us who conduct monetary policy it is naturally a problem that it is difficult to
tell just how much employment can rise without entailing a risk of a renewed acceleration of wages
and inflation. But that is no reason for believing that the functioning of the labour market and wage
formation will not be of central importance for future inflation. This brings me to the current situation
in the labour market.
The current situation in the labour market
The Riksbank’s view of the Swedish economy in the coming years is comparatively optimistic. With
the low interest rates and some recovery in international economic activity, GDP growth is judged to
be  2.5  per  cent  this  year  and  3  per  cent  in  both  2000  and  2001.  As  I  mentioned  earlier,  this  will
presumably involve the gradual utilisation of the resources that are unutilised at present.

Increased employment is also foreseen and in the June Inflation Report we counted on a reduction of
unemployment to below 5 per cent in two years time. Against this background, in the period 1999–
2001  the  average  annual  rate  of  wage  increases  is  judged  to  be  3.5–4  per  cent.  That  seems  to  be
consistent with a forecast annual rate of productivity growth of 1.5–2 percent and the same order of
inflation expectations among the labour market organisations.
I  should  perhaps  underscore  that  this  is  a  forecast,  not  a  desired  rate  of  wage  increases.  A  lower
nominal wage rise would create better conditions for a quicker increase in employment.
How  wages  actually  develop  and  the  consequences  of  this  for  inflation  and  monetary  policy  will
depend in large measure on how the labour market turns out to function in the coming upward phase.
The Riksbank will be keeping a watchful eye on the available indicators. The estimates of the NAIRU
and  the  output  gap  suggest  that  inflationary  pressure  is  rising  and  that  in  our  forecast  period  the
economy will approach or even reach full capacity utilisation. But, as I emphasised earlier, it is not
only these indicators that we will be considering. All incoming statistics that contribute to the picture
of future inflationary pressure will be followed closely.
It  should  also  be  underscored  that  the  outcome  is  not  inevitable.  An  influence  can  be  exerted  with
economic policy. I spoke earlier of how budget measures in the form of taxes as well as expenditures
can  modify  the  workings  of  the  labour  market  and  the  economy  in  general.  As  regards  the  labour
market and wage formation, there are many other things to do, for instance in labour market policy,
the rules and implementation of unemployment support, the rules that influence wage formation and
so on.
Concluding remarks
In many respects, economic policy has produced good results in recent years. This applies not least to
the interaction of fiscal and monetary policy. Government debt has been reduced, interest rates have
fallen  and  economic  growth  has  been  good,  and  all  this  has  been  combined  with  low  inflation.
Employment has been a problem; there are now clear signs of an improvement here, too.
One important explanation for the successful combination of high growth and low inflation in recent
years is that the crisis in the early 1990s brought capacity utilisation down to a low level. If economic
7
BIS Review   77/1999
activity  strengthens  as  expected,  the  situation  may  gradually  change.  Capacity  utilisation  is  rising.
This presents policy with new challenges, with an increased risk of higher inflation.
It is desirable that the interaction of fiscal and monetary policy continues to function well. There are
strong reasons for adhering to the rules that have been established. An increase of 1 percentage point
in  the  level  of  interest  rates  weakens  the  budget  balance  by  about  SEK  10  billion.  A  continued
amortisation  of  the  sizeable  government  debt  will  create  much-needed  room  to  manoeuvre  in
economic policy. There will be more scope for stimulating increased demand in future slowdowns.
At the same time, tax cuts would clearly benefit the Swedish economy in the somewhat longer run.
But the cuts must then be concentrated to just those taxes that play a major part in the workings of the
economy,  where  changes  can  help  to  raise  potential  output.  Together  with  other  measures  that
improve wage formation and the functioning of the labour market, such tax adjustments could lead to
the creation of new jobs without an acceleration of inflation. The more steps that can be taken in this
direction,  the  better  will  be  the  conditions  for  a  continuation  of  a  good  economic  development  in
Sweden.
