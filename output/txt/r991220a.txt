Mr Bäckström discusses the prospects for the Swedish economy
on the threshold of the new millennium
Speech given by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Board
of Directors and President of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Umeå School of Economics
and Business Administration on 3 December 1999.
 First a word of thanks for the invitation to Umeå to discuss the prospects for the Swedish economy on
the threshold of the new millennium.
In an economic perspective, the last century of this  millennium  appears  to be  unique. The  dramatic
improvement  in  prosperity  and  living  standards  that  has  taken  place  during  the  20th  century  is
unparalleled in the history of our country. As recently as the 19th century, Sweden was poor, perhaps
even one of the poorest European countries.
History  teaches us that  material prosperity  can  never  be  taken  for  granted.  Countries  and  areas  can
suddenly rise up and become culturally and materially prominent only to subsequently fall back again
into poverty. There are examples of this in the present millennium as well as in those preceeding it.
Economic growth is not just a matter of the usual economic aspects, i.e. accumulation of real capital
and population increase. There are cases where countries with a high rate of capital investment and
relatively  high  population  growth  have  failed  to  transform  this  into  rapidly  increasing  material
prosperity. The former planned economies are clear examples of this.
Something more is evidently required. There are interesting lessons to be drawn here and challenges
for the new millennium. Let me first briefly describe the last century of this millennium in economic
terms. This can provide a good perspective for assessments of our future economic prospects.
The 20th century was a fantastic century in many respects
In many respects, the 20th century has been a fantastic century in Sweden. The standard of living -
measured  as  GDP  per  inhabitant  -  has  risen  almost  ninefold  in  a  hundred  years.  Total  production,
GDP,  has  increased  almost  twenty  times,  while  the  population  has  doubled.  This  can  be  compared
with the 19th century when the standard of living only doubled or at most tripled - the lack of statistics
makes it difficult to be more exact.
During  the  20th  century,  annual  GDP  growth  has  averaged  around  3%,  though  the  increase  in
production  has  been  far from  evenly  distributed  over  time.  In  the  1920s,  as  well  as  in  the  post-war
years from the 1940s to the 1960s, growth was above the average for the century.
Towards  the  end  of  the  century,  however,  the  annual  increases  in  production  slackened.  Growth
became increasingly weak during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The average growth rate for the 1990s
is in fact the worst in the entire century. However, the average for this decade is pulled down by the
negative growth from 1990 to 1993. From 1994 onwards, the growth rate has returned to the previous
average  and  the  annual  change  is  close  to  3%.  Hopefully,  the  weaker  trend  during  the  period  that
began in the early 1970s has been reversed in the past few years. However, this cannot be taken for
granted.  One  explanation  for  the  recent  stronger  growth  is  that  the  deep  recession  left  a  reserve  of
unutilised resources that could gradually be taken into use. Nevertheless, potential GDP growth is now
often said to be between 2% and 2.5%, since most analysts consider that the productivity  trend  has
improved slightly in recent years.

In both the 19th and the 20th century the Swedish population has roughly doubled. In 1820 it totalled
2.6 million; at the beginning of the 20th century, it was almost 5 million, and the figure today is almost
9 million.
BIS Review 137/1999

These figures  mean  an  average  annual  population  growth  rate  of around  0.7%. That is  not the  case
today;  the  current  figure  is  closer  to  approximately  half  of  this  level.  According  to  the  forecast  of
Statistics Sweden, the population will only increase by around 0.1-0.2% this year and during the first
decade of the 21st century.
With  GDP  growth  of  3%  and  a  population  increase  of  around  0.7%  a  year,  a  rough  measure  of
productivity  is  obtained  which  shows  that  it  has  increased  on  average  by  2.3%  per  year  during  the
20th century as a whole. Nowadays, the figure is lower; most analysts estimate that trend productivity
is under rather than over 2% per year, although there has been some improvement in recent years.
The standard of living has accordingly not risen as quickly during the 1990s as it did during a number
of earlier decades during the century.

Sweden
UK
In order to obtain an idea of developments in Sweden we can look at the United Kingdom. Sweden is
considered to have become industrialised about hundred years after the UK. GDP per capita therefore
grew  more  quickly  in  Britain  than  in  Sweden  during  the  first  half  of  the  19th  century.  From  1870
onwards, however, the relationship between the two countries changed. Growth per capita became the
same in both countries and after 1890 and up to 1970, Sweden took the lead. The Swedish economy
experienced  a  fantastic  period  of  growth.  After  1970  growth  slowed  and  Sweden  fell  behind  other
countries.
Annual  inflation  has  averaged  around  4%  in  the  20th  century.  However,  this  average  conceals
relatively sharp fluctuations in the rate of inflation at the beginning of the century and a successively
rising trend in the post-war period. This rising trend was first interrupted during the 1990s.
In  the  closing  stages  of  World  War  One,  a  remarkable  increase  of  the  inflation  rate  took  place.
Inflation rate in 1918, for instance, was almost 40%. This inflation period was changed into a period of
deflation in the early 1920s when prices fell for three years in a row. Altogether, the price level fell by
over 40% between 1921 and 1923. This was truly a period of deflation.

Swedish  price  statistics  are  available  from  the  beginning  of  the  1830s.  They  show  inflation  was
relatively stable and averaged just over 0.5% a year between 1830 up to the outbreak of World War
One.  For  the  entire  period  from  1830  up  to  today,  the  average  rate  is  around  2.5%,  which  accords
relatively well with our inflation target.

The employment trends in different sectors, as a proportion of total employment, shows the Swedish
economy’s transformation during the 20th century. Three different stages are especially clear.
Firstly,  fewer  and  fewer  people  earn  a  living  from  agriculture  over  the  years.  Having  provided
employment  for  around  60%  of  the  labour  force  at  the  beginning  of  the  century,  agriculture  now
engages only a couple of per cent. This change reflects a dramatic increase in agricultural productivity
and  thereby  internal  migration.  The  population  in  rural  areas  falls  and  large  cities  such  as  Malmö,
Gothenburg and Stockholm grow. It is also primarily in these regions that growth is generated.
Secondly,  the  shrinking  agricultural  sector  is  reflected  in  a  corresponding  increase  in  industrial
employment.  Manufacturing  occupied  over  30%  of  the  labour  force  in  the  1950s  when  this  part  of
Sweden’s corporate sector was largest in terms of employment. Thereafter, the proportion of employed
in this sector has fallen.
Finally,  the  really  dramatic  development  as  regards  increased  employment  is  the  expansion  of  the
service  sector.  At  the  end  of  the  20th  century,  the  service  sector  provides  employment  for  over
two-thirds of the labour force in comparison with around 20% at the beginning of the century. In the
beginning,  it  involved  expansion  of  the  private  service  sector,  but  from  the  late  1950s  and  the
beginning of the 1960s, public employment grew at a fast rate. The share rose from around 10% to
approximately a third of the labour force in the 1990s.
An important factor behind the rapid expansion of the service sector is that women started to take paid
employment. This created a demand for the production of both public and private services. Women’s
entry into the labour market meant that a previously untapped labour reserve was used.
These  changes  have  meant  large  transformations  which  have  had  an  impact  on  people’s  everyday
lives.  However, these  have  probably  been  necessary  to  bring  about  the  marked  increase  in  material
prosperity.

Finally, I should like to illustrate the fact that the transformation of the economy in the 20th century
has  not  always  taken  place  in  calm  and  harmonious  forms.  There  have  been  some  large  ups  and
5
BIS Review 137/1999
downs. The situation was most turbulent in the early 1910s and the 1920s. A period of high inflation
and rapidly growing demand was followed by deflation and a large fall in total production.
Otherwise, development has been relatively uniform and stable since the breakthrough of industrialism
in the mid-19th century apart from the 1870s and also the early 1930s, which is not so clearly visible
in the diagram.
Challenges on the threshold to a new millennium
At the end of the 20th century, the new information technology is making rapid progress. As far as we
can see today, it will affect production and distribution processes as well as consumer behaviour. That
in turn makes the environment more competitive and calls for further change in Sweden’s corporate
sector.
Put  to  good  use,  this  transformation  can  probably  create  stronger  potential  growth,  lead  to  higher
productivity growth and lower inflation, and benefit employment. The favourable changes that have
occurred  over  a  number  of  years  in  the  Swedish  economy  since  the  1980s  suggest  that  such  a
development is within our grasp.
All forecasts to date about the spread of the Internet have been on the low side. In the United States, it
was 38 years before 50 million households had radio sets, while the intervals for television sets and
cable television were 13 and 10 years. The Internet, however, had reached 50 million households after
only 5 years and according to some estimates the number of users will increase greatly during the next
few years.
It has been said that whereas conventional telephony in Sweden is growing by 7% a year, traffic on the
Internet  is  currently  rising  at  this  rate  every  week.  It  is  not  just  that  more  and  more  people  are
subscribing;  those  who  surf  on  the  Internet  are  doing  so  more  and  more.  The  number  of  surfers  is
measured by Sifo Research & Consulting; the figures show that almost 3.5 million people in Sweden
surf, which is not quite half of the population aged 12 to 79. Of these, as many as 2 million stated that
they surfed on a daily basis. Another noteworthy figure is that in the age group 50-79 years, almost
20%  are  active  users  of  the  Internet.  So  the  Internet  is  not  something  that  only  young  people  find
attractive.
Furthermore, Sweden is one of the absolute  leaders in information technology  (IT),  both  as regards
Internet  users  and  in  broader  terms  such  as  the  number  of  computers  and  mobile  phones.  In  such
surveys, the United States usually comes out top.
The Internet makes it simple to obtain information, communicate with others and trade in goods and
services. Price comparisons are already feasible and one can buy some goods and services, not least
bank  services.  In  these  ways  the  Internet  cuts  distances,  overcomes  borders,  contributes  to  a  more
competitive  environment  and  enables  consumers  to  be  better  informed.  Everyone  can  get  the
information he or she needs easily and painlessly, often dispensing with intermediaries.
Besides  affecting  consumer  behaviour,  the  Internet  and  information  technology  in  general  have
consequences for production processes. In addition to more informed consumers, we have firms with
better oversight of production, material inputs, distribution processes and sales.
Information technology compared with the railways
Simplifying  somewhat,  the  advent  of  the  Internet  can  be  compared  with  the  era  of  railroad
construction in Sweden in the second half of the 19th century.
In the initial phase, there was a boom for those who constructed the railways and manufactured rolling
stock. In the closing decade of the century, Swedish firms began to produce locomotives; previously
that had been the preserve of British manufacturers. The Swedish firms took over the domestic market
and  were  even  able  to  export  their  products.  Much  the  same  happened  with  the  manufacture  of
passenger carriages and goods wagons.
BIS Review 137/1999

Today we can see similar developments in the IT industry. Besides the giant Ericssson, Sweden has
many  different  IT  enterprises.  But  growth  is  still  being  driven  not  so  much  by  users  of  the  new
communication facilities as by the production of new possibilities.
To continue with the comparison, in the next phase people started to travel by rail. A journey from
Stockholm  to  Gothenburg  admittedly  took  11  hours  and  45  minutes  in  1865  but  that  was  nothing
compared with a horse-drawn carriage. Travelling became quicker and more efficient; people gained
new impressions and learned new things. Sweden became smaller.
Today  we  travel  on  the  Internet  by  gathering  information  simply  and  efficiently  from  all  over  the
world, largely for the price of a local telephone call. Millions of people in all parts of the world are
indeed using this facility and in that sense the world has now become smaller.
The really important phase, however, was when the railways began to affect processes for production
and  distribution.  Previously,  production  in  Sweden  had  been  located  in  the  vicinity  of  iron  ore  and
forests. The units were numerous and not particularly efficient; transportation was slow. In the county
of Värmland, for example, there were sixty different sites for the production of iron in 1870. When the
railways had been constructed, it was easier to concentrate production to fewer sites; by around 1900
there  were  only  six  sites  and  they  were  accordingly  considerably  more  efficient.  This  is  just  an
example to illustrate how the railways played a major part in Sweden’s industrial upswing in the late
19th century. Productivity and growth rose.
For the information technology, this phase of the process probably lies ahead. The new technology has
not yet seriously altered either production and distribution processes or consumer behaviour. Progress
is still a little hesitant as more and more people use the new technique for surfing and learn the new
technology. The potential will also be limited as long as the technique is not entirely user-friendly.
IT generates pressure for change
When the new information technology really catches on, it will probably lead to a rapid expansion and
transformation of capital stocks. The entire economy will then be involved in intensive investment and
high productivity growth. Old technology will be replaced by new and each unit of capital equipment
will  then  require  a  smaller  input  of  labour.  Unprofitable  units  or  firms  will  be  closed  down,
accompanied by new establishments. Structural changes generate developments that are often referred
to  at  present  as  a  new  “economy”.  The  marked  improvement  in  productivity  maintains  profits  and
keeps prices down. During the transformation, a good circle is created  but  it is  difficult  to  tell  how
long it will last. It can be described, if you like, as a period of extensive rationalisation and heightened
efficiency. The growth trend is raised for an indefinite period, enabling the economy to expand more
rapidly without inflation taking off.
It  should  be  borne  in  mind  that  the  adaptation  to  the  new  information  technology  does  not  occur
automatically. It is not the case that one day we suddenly find the new technology has begun to be
implemented in ways that are leaving their mark on economic developments in general.
During recent decades economists have increasingly highlighted institutional aspects in a broad sense
as an explanation as to why some economies grow more rapidly than others. This approach underlines
that the rate of economic growth is related to the system of rights and incentives that is adopted in a
country  and  the  determination  to  maintain  this  system  in  a  credible  way.  In  economic  jargon,  it  is
usually  asserted  that  the  incentive  structure  and  its  impact  on  economic  growth  is  formed  by  the
existing institutional structure.
The late 19th century provides important lessons about the necessary conditions for this good circle.
At the beginning of the 1800s, as I said before, Sweden was still a poor country with an unstable form
of government, a chaotic monetary system and a general shortage of credit facilities. Ninety years later
the  Swedish economy  had  undergone  a  dramatic transformation.  Inflation  was  low,  with  an  orderly
monetary  system.  The  nation  was  bursting  with  vitality  in  every  field.  An  impressive  range  of
products,  many  of  them  world  leaders,  were  being  developed  on  the  basis  of  Swedish  inventions.
Swedish  financial  experts  were  engaged  in  the  exploitation  of  the  inventions  at  an  early  stage.
7
BIS Review 137/1999
Employment was provided for more and more people, living standards rose and growth was among the
highest in the world.
Opinions  about  the  causes  of  the  pronounced  change  in  the  Swedish  economy  are  not  completely
unanimous.  An  increasingly  stable  form  of  government  presumably  contributed.  A  series  of
constitutional reforms provided a guarantee of stability.
The stable prices presumably played a part. When inflation is low or the price level is stable, those
who have to plan for the longer run face less uncertainty. After a rather chaotic period in the history of
the monetary system, the introduction of the silver standard in the early 1830s and subsequently the
gold standard led to price stability.
Another significant factor was probably the credit system’s development. Banks were established and
the abolition of interest controls was followed by more financial expertise. That made it possible to
exploit the inventions and finance investments in the emerging industries.
Economic activities benefited from the abolition of trade guilds, freedom to trade and the reform of
joint-stock companies. The reform of elementary education was, of course, another important step that
ultimately promoted human capital.
This  catalogue  is  not  intended  to  be  a  complete  account  of  all  the  factors  behind  Sweden’s
transformation  from  a  poor  country  into  a  rapidly  expanding  industrial  nation.  The  point  I  want  to
make is that a variety of institutional changes seem to have been needed to provide a stable framework
for the subsequent process of industrialisation. It is just this stability in the fundamental conditions for
economic  activities  that  was  no  doubt  important  for  the  process  that  resulted  in  the  industrial
revolution, which in itself was full of commercial risks and uncertainties.
Improvement in opportunities for change
A  similar  gloss  can  be  applied  to  the  realignment  of  economic  policy  from  the  second  half  of  the
1980s. There have been a number of reforms aimed at creating stability and opportunities. The credit
and  currency  markets  have  been  deregulated,  components  of  the  social  security  system  have  been
reformed, a tax reform has been implemented, targets have been established for government finances,
price stability is enshrined in law and the Riksbank has been given an independent status.
All this represents good possibilities of the Swedish economy facing a stable future as we step over the
threshold to a new millennium. It is important that wage formation also functions properly. It remains
to be seen whether the Swedish economy has changed in this area. Otherwise, there is a risk that firms
will be under pressure from two fronts. Profitability will be depressed both by increased competition
and by rising wage costs. Investment will be held back and the transformation will proceed too slowly
or  not  at  all.  There  will  then  be  no  quick  renewal  of  capital  stocks.  Companies  will  not  draw  the
benefit of the new information technology at a sufficiently rapid rate and will then lag behind. Other
critical  factors  that  may  affect  the  rate  of  transformation  are,  for  instance,  the  tax  system,  the
educational system, etc.
Various  factors  that  hamper  or  check  an  adjustment  could  thus  result  in  the  Swedish  economy
following  a  lower  instead  of  a  higher,  path  for  long-term  growth,  with  a  stronger,  not  a  weaker
inflation propensity and a continuation of high unemployment instead of a reduction to the low level
that most people want. These risks seldom feature in the general discussion about the new economy.
Conclusion
From an economic perspective, the 20th century has been a fantastic century. One of the explanations
for this has been the existence of an ability to adapt the economy to new conditions and this has also
led to rapidly rising living standards.
The  changes  that  many  people  refer  to  as  the  new  economy  unquestionably  present  a  number  of
challenges to the Swedish economy at the end of the 20th century. The notion of a new economy is not
BIS Review 137/1999
8
correct; that is not what it is all about. It is rather a matter of a new challenge in the long series of
challenges the Swedish economy has had to face ever since the dawn of the industrial era more than a
century ago.
Concepts  such  as  development  and  winding-up  are  important  components  in  an  ongoing
transformation  and  adaptation  of  the  Swedish  economy.  It  is  just  as  important  a  prerequisite  for
increasing prosperity now that the world is on its way into a new millennium as it was over a hundred
years ago when Sweden was industrialised. The smoother we make such a continuous transformation,
the greater the chances will be of looking forward to a new fantastic century.
