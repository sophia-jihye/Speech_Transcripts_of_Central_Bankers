Mr Gjedrem reports on the Norwegian economy and monetary policy in Norway
Speech given by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of the Norges Bank, at the Royal Norwegian Embassy,
in London on 28 October 1999.
 Introduction
1.
Ambassador,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  I  am  happy  to  have  this  opportunity  to  speak  to  you  about
monetary policy in Norway. What happens in the financial community in London is important to the
Norwegian economy: the financial markets here provide  substantial loans  for  Norwegian  firms,  and
are  at  the  same  time  an  important  recipient  of  Norwegian  financial  investments.  Short-term  capital
movements  between  United  Kingdom  and  Norway  are  also  important.  Against  this  background,  I
would  like  to  share  with  you  information  about  the  Norwegian  economy.  My  focus  will  be  on
explaining distinctive aspects of the Norwegian economy, which is based largely on a limited number
of  commodities.  My  hope  is  that  this  understanding  may  help  market  operators  to  make  informed
decisions when dealing with Norwegian markets.
Background
2.
Trend  GDP  growth  in  the  Norwegian  mainland  economy  is  about  2–2¼%,  and  the  inflation  rate  is
around 2%. GDP per capita is slightly higher than in most other European countries. The high level of
per capita income is partly a result of extensive revenues from oil and gas extraction. These revenues
also allow Norway to operate with a substantial current account and government budget surplus.
Extraction  of  North  Sea  oil  started  in  the  1970s,  and  the  production  volume  has  increased  over  the
years.  The  petroleum  sector  employs  only  a  small  part  of  the  total  labour  force,  but  brings  in
substantial revenues. A main question for Norwegian economic policy is therefore how to stabilise the
Norwegian economy in the face of high, fluctuating revenues from the petroleum sector.
The importance of the petroleum sector
3.
Some  figures  will illustrate  the  importance of  the  petroleum  sector  in  the  Norwegian  economy.  Oil
production started in the 1970s and has gradually increased. Given the current estimates for existing
resources, production is expected to be at its maximum level between the years 2000 and 2010, and
then decrease gradually as the remaining resources are reduced. The level of future oil production is
highly uncertain.
Employment in the petroleum  sector  and  related industries is  only  around  4% of total employment.
Investment  in  the  petroleum  sector  has  been  substantial  compared  to  investment  in  the  rest  of  the
economy, and as a share of GDP.
Investment has an import share of about 1/3, which means that investment relating to the petroleum
sector has had a substantial effect on industries in mainland Norway.
The income from petroleum extraction is of substantial significance to the Norwegian economy and to
the public sector in particular. In the 1990s the export value of oil has been around 1/3 of total exports
excluding ships and oil rigs.
The petroleum sector is an important source of revenues for the government, both through taxes and
through direct government ownership.

BIS Review 121/1999
Projections indicate that revenues will remain at about the same level until around 2008, when they are
expected to gradually decrease as petroleum production declines.
The Norwegian Government runs a budget surplus including petroleum revenues.
The columns show the budget surplus (or deficit), excluding petroleum revenues. The line represents
total  net  government  surplus,  which  is  transferred  to  the  Government  Petroleum  Fund.  The  surplus
also  includes  yields  on  Fund  investments.  We  note  that  the  amount  of  petroleum  income  used  to
finance public expenditure varies from year to year, while a large portion of the income is saved.
Oil prices and hence petroleum revenues fluctuate over time.

After  a  period  of  high  prices  in  the  1970s,  when  OPEC  first  demonstrated  its  power,  and  the  early
1980s, oil prices have been fairly stable.
Focusing on the last 15 years, somewhat larger fluctuations have been observed since 1997. In 1998
the  price  of  oil  dropped  temporarily  below  $10 per  barrel.  This  year  the  price  has  increased
substantially above the $15 to $17 a barrel price range that we consider a more “normal” level.

Fluctuating oil prices and economic stability: Dutch disease and the Government
Petroleum Fund
Oil revenues increase consumption possibilities. However, it is a challenge to manage these resources
in a way that increases welfare for current and future generations. A rapid expansion of the sheltered
sector  based  on  uncertain  and  perhaps  temporary  increases  in  petroleum  revenues  may  lead  to  the
situation called Dutch disease.
The  impact  of  oil  price fluctuations on  the  exchange  rate  and  on  economic  stability  in  general  will
depend on the speed at which petroleum revenues are used. In general, income can either be used now,
or  saved  by  accumulating  assets  abroad,  so  as  to  redistribute  the  increased  income  and  thus
consumption between  generations. The income  can be  used  to  increase  net  imports  while  resources
BIS Review 121/1999
4
from  the  internationally  exposed  sector  are  transferred  to  the  sheltered  sector.  This  will  allow  for
increased consumption of both exposed and sheltered sector goods.  If  petroleum  revenues  are to  be
used for increased sheltered goods consumption, a real exchange rate appreciation will be needed to
initiate the reallocation of resources to the sheltered sector. The extent of the reallocation will depend
on how fast the revenues are used and how much is saved for future consumption.
Suppose,  as  one  extreme,  that  all  income  entering  the  government  budget  were  used  in  that  same
period. This means that an increase in the oil price would increase government income and domestic
demand, encouraging a reallocation of resources from the exposed to  the  sheltered  sector.  If  the oil
price  fell  again later,  Norway  would be  left  with  an exposed  sector  that  is  too  small,  resulting  in  a
current  account  deficit  and  expectations  of  an  exchange  rate  depreciation  that  would  be  needed  to
restore the exposed sector.
Such fluctuations in the use of oil revenues would lead to considerable instability in the Norwegian
economy  and  large  fluctuations  in  the  exchange  rate  over  time.  Norwegian  economic  policy  is
organised to counteract such instability.
The  key  issue  is  to  prevent  increased  petroleum  revenues  from  leading  directly  to  increased
government  consumption,  in  other  words  to  reduce  the  dependence  of  government  spending  on  oil
revenues. The share of government spending financed by oil revenues varies over the business cycle.
For the past few years this share has averaged around 3% and it is expected to be kept at about that
level over the coming years. To this end, Norway has created the Government Petroleum Fund, which
receives  revenues  from  the  petroleum  sector,  transfers  the  amount  necessary  to  produce  a  balanced
government budget and invests the surplus abroad. As long as the increase in petroleum income is kept
outside  the  domestic  economy,  there  will  be  less  need  for  structural  change  and  thus  less  need  for
exchange rates to change.
The Petroleum Fund serves many purposes. It is a means of storing wealth and redistributing income
from oil extraction between generations, of buffering against changes in oil prices, and of facilitating
demand management. Thus, the Fund facilitates the fiscal policy tasks of maintaining the desired size
of the exposed sector and stabilising the economy.

BIS Review 121/1999
North Sea oil and gas reserves are part of Norway’s economic wealth. Extracting the oil and allocating
the revenues to the Petroleum Fund is a way of transforming this wealth into financial assets abroad.
The  purpose  of  accumulating  capital  in  the  Fund  is  to  redistribute  petroleum  revenues  between
generations  and  ensure  the  long-term  stability  of  state  finances.  The  larger  the  Fund,  the  less
dependent Norway will be on petroleum revenues in the future, and the more prepared we will be to
meet the challenge of an ageing population.
Furthermore, the Petroleum Fund acts as a buffer against short-term variations in petroleum revenues
by separating the cash flow from oil extraction from current expenditure. Since a large share of the
revenues from  petroleum  activities  accrues  to  the  state,  any  fluctuations  in  oil  prices  will  primarily
result in changes in allocations to the Fund. Since all of the Fund’s capital is invested abroad, such
changes will in principle not influence economic activity. This makes the Norwegian economy more
robust to oil price fluctuations, thereby reducing oil dependence in the short term.
To illustrate the importance of the buffer function, let us assume that the oil price shows a temporary
rise of NOK 10 per barrel, or a little less than USD 1.50 per barrel, lasting for about a year. This is a
small change in the oil price, well within normal variations from one year to  the  next.  Government
revenues - and hence the budget surplus - would then increase by around NOK 10 billion in the first
year and NOK 12–13 billion the next year. This corresponds to around 1% of Norway’s annual GDP.
By comparison, annual trend growth in the mainland economy is slightly over 2%. Note that a price
increase on the margin will be reflected mainly in an increase in government revenues and will have
limited  effect  on  private  sector  incomes.  This  means  that  the  effect  of  the  price  increase  on  the
Norwegian  economy  depends  on  how  the  government  spends  the  additional  revenues.  If  they  are
absorbed into the economy through higher expenditure or reduced taxes, when the economy is already
nearing  capacity,  such  a  policy  would  rapidly  lead  to  substantial  pressures  on  resources  in  the
economy. This would translate into an acceleration of wage and price inflation and unstable conditions
in  the  foreign  exchange  market.  The  Petroleum  Fund  is  designed  to  channel  the  revenues  resulting
from an increase in the oil price to the Fund for investment abroad, in order to prevent an increase in
oil prices from influencing the budget. The increased revenues would thus not have an impact on the
domestic economy, but be invested abroad through the Petroleum Fund.
The current account balance and government budget surplus show that Norwegian consumption has
adjusted to petroleum wealth by increasing net imports and by maintaining a budget deficit excluding
petroleum  revenues.  At  the  same  time  some  of  the  wealth  is  saved  abroad  to  redistribute  income
between generations. This means that there has already been a gradual resource reallocation from the
exposed to the sheltered sector. As long as consumption is fairly well adjusted to the expected level of
the petroleum wealth, there may not be a need for substantial exchange rate movements in the near
future to achieve further adjustment.
Stability of the Norwegian krone
5.
Let us turn to the stability of the krone. People in the banking industry often suggest that the krone is a
petro currency fluctuating widely with the price of oil. Is this the case, or has stabilisation policy been
successful in Norway so far?
Looking at the data, we note that the krone exchange rate has been fairly stable over time. Since 1986
the authorities have focused on stability of the krone exchange rate. From 1986 to 1992 Norway had a
fixed  exchange  rate  system  with  a  defined  central  rate  with  fluctuation  margins.  This  system  was
abandoned  in  1992  after  extensive  speculation  against  the  krone  during  the  period  of  unrest  in
European exchange markets. Following the decision to allow the krone to float on 10 December 1992,
the guidelines for monetary policy were revised. Monetary policy was subsequently oriented towards
exchange rate stability, but without stipulating a central rate with fluctuation margins.
The krone depreciated slightly immediately after the crisis, but then remained stable without extensive
use of Norges Bank’s instruments. Since 1996, the exchange rate has fluctuated more widely. There
may be several reasons for this. During part of this period, the government budget has not contributed
sufficiently  to  smoothing  growth  in  domestic  demand  and  production.  Wage  inflation  in  1997  and
BIS Review 121/1999
6
1998 was higher than in other countries. Turbulence in international financial markets has also had an
important  contagion effect  on the  krone.  In  addition,  oil revenues  have  fluctuated,  which  may  have
affected investors’ expectations regarding future developments in the Norwegian economy.

The pressure against the krone exchange rate was particularly strong in the autumn of 1998. The crisis,
first in Asia and later in Russia, led to considerable turbulence in international markets. At the same
time,  pressure  in  the  labour  market  led  to  high  wage  increases,  while  the  current  account  was
negatively  affected  by  a  fall  in  export  prices,  combined  with  increases  in  imports.  All  in  all,  these
factors contributed to creating depreciation expectations. Thus, fluctuations in oil prices represent only
one of many causes of exchange rate variability over the past few years.
Monetary policy is aiming at exchange rate stability. The krone exchange rate depreciated gradually
through the first half of 1998, and in  August there  was  a  strong  pressure against  the  krone.  Norges
Bank responded by increasing its key rates seven times through 1998, with a total of 4½ percentage
points.  After  the  last  interest  rate  increase,  in  August  1998,  the  interest  rate  on  banks’  deposits  in
Norges Bank was 8%. The strong increase in interest rates was not sufficient to bring the exchange
rate back to its initial range. However, Norges Bank evaluated that further interest rate increases would
not lead to a further appreciation of the krone, as a higher interest rate might contribute to a recession
and thereby destabilise the economy. This would not be a credible monetary policy.
In 1999 the economy has been cooling off, wage settlements have been moderate, and oil prices have
increased again. The krone has returned to its initial range, while interest rates have been cut by a total
of  2.5 percentage  points  this  year,  by  0.5 percentage  point  each  time.  The  last  cut  was  on
22 September, when the interest rate was reduced to 5.5%.
Since  1992  the  nominal  value  of  the  krone  has  remained  close  to  the  same  level.  Moreover,  the
average  inflation  rate in the  1990s  has  been  2¼%, indicating  real  exchange  rate stability.  Thus,  the
exchange rate has been surprisingly stable in the face of fluctuating oil revenues.
We  can  conclude  that  the  exchange  rate  has  been  fairly  stable  over  a  long  period.  However,
developments  in  recent  years  indicate  that  Norges  Bank  cannot  fine-tune  movements  in  the  krone
exchange  rate.  Norges  Bank  will  therefore  focus  on  factors  determining  long-term  exchange  rate
stability.

The mandate
6.
Let  us  turn  to  the  mandate  for  monetary  policy  and  how  Norges  Bank  interprets  its  role  and
responsibilities.  The  political  authorities  formulate  Norges  Bank’s  mandate  for  the  conduct  of
monetary  policy.  The  mandate  is  laid  down  in  the  Exchange  Rate  Regulation,  adopted  by  Royal
Decree of 6 May 1994. Section 2 of the Regulation states:
Chart 9 The Regulation of May 6, 1994
(cid:127) “The monetary policy to be conducted by Norges
Bank shall be aimed at stable exchange rates against
European currencies, based on the exchange rate
maintained since the krone was floated 10 December
1992.”
(cid:127) “In the event of significant changes in the exchange
rate, policy instruments will be oriented with a view
to returning the exchange rate over time to its initial
range. No fluctuation margins are established, nor is
there an appurtenant obligation on Norges Bank to
intervene in the foreign exchange market.”
Legg inn filadresse her
BIS Review 121/1999
8
The first sentence in the Regulation indicates that we have a managed float of the krone, based on the
range of the exchange rate maintained since the krone was floated in December 1992. Instruments are
to be oriented towards maintaining a stable krone exchange rate against European currencies. Norges
Bank has chosen to define the term European currencies as the euro from 1 January 1999.
The  Regulation  does  not  stipulate  a  central  rate  with  specific  fluctuation  margins.  Norges  Bank
interprets the concept initial range as a broad indication of a central rate around which the krone can
fluctuate.
The second sentence refers to significant changes in the exchange rate in relation to the initial range. It
is important to note that the concept significant changes is not quantified. Significant must therefore be
given an economic content. A reasonable interpretation is that a  significant change  is  a  change  that
influences expectations concerning price and cost inflation to the extent that changes in the exchange
rate become self-reinforcing through a wage-price spiral.
The expressions with a view to,  over time,  aimed  at and  based on  also show  that  Norges  Bank  has
considerable latitude for exercising discretion.
The instruments
7.
Monetary policy is conducted through two main instruments - exchange-market interventions and the
Bank’s  key  interest  rates.  Interventions  influence  the  supply  of  kroner  in  the  exchange  market.  A
change  in  interest  rates  influences  both  conditions  in  the  exchange  market  and  total  demand  and
production. Monetary policy may thus influence price and cost inflation through both these channels.
In Norges Bank’s experience,  extensive  exchange-market  interventions have  yielded  poor  results.  If
the central bank intervenes heavily to defend the krone, this may evolve into a game situation in which
market participants perceive central bank interventions as an interesting opportunity to make a profit.
Market agents know that a situation in which the krone is being propped up because Norges Bank is
intervening cannot be sustained. It is then tempting to take positions in the foreign exchange market
against the central bank. This implies that heavy interventions may intensify the pressure on the krone
over  time,  steadily  increasing  the  necessary  volume  of  interventions.  If  market  participants  assume
that Norges Bank will use the interest rate to defend specific exchange rate levels, this may lead to a
similar game situation.
Norges Bank does not intend to behave in a way that will prompt such game situations. However, the
Bank  may  use  interventions to  a limited  extent  if  the  exchange  rate  moves  substantially  out  of  line
with what we consider to be reasonable on the basis of fundamentals, or in the event of exceptional
short-term volatility in thin markets. In such circumstances, there is less risk of ending up in a game
situation against exchange market agents.
Norges Bank’s most important instruments are its two key rates - the interest rate on banks’ deposits
and  the  overnight  lending  rate.  Experience  shows  that  the  central  bank’s  key  rates  have  a  fairly
substantial  impact  on  money  market  rates  at  the  very  short  end  of  the  market,  i.e. overnight  and
one-week rates. The effect on interest rates on financial instruments with longer maturities is not as
direct.  Here,  expectations  concerning  the  central  bank’s  course  of  action  and  general  confidence  in
monetary policy play a role, as does the level of very short-term rates.
Money market rates influence the krone exchange rate directly through the return that can be achieved
on krone positions, but also indirectly through the effect on the outlook for the real economy and price
and cost inflation in Norway. A higher interest rate will, therefore, normally result in an appreciation.
Both the appreciation and the interest rate increase will lower demand. The appreciation will also in
itself lead to lower inflation on imports, while lower demand will reduce the general inflation level.
Over time both the inflation rate and the activity level will influence the exchange rate. Thus, Norges
Bank needs to exercise discretion in monetary policy by considering the effects of interest rate changes
not  only  directly  on  the  exchange  rate,  but  also  on  the  rest  of  the  economy,  and  to  focus  on  the
fundamental conditions for exchange rate stability over time.

Exercising discretion in monetary policy
8.
The  mandate  stipulates  the  objective  of  monetary  policy,  but  Norges  Bank  has  to  choose  how  to
achieve  the  objective.  As  shown,  the  krone  exchange  rate  has  fluctuated  in  recent  years  in  spite  of
Norges Bank’s active use of instruments, indicating that Norges Bank cannot fine-tune movements in
the krone exchange rate.
The  exchange  rate  will  also in  the  future  be  influenced  by  factors  that  are  not  under  the  control  of
Norges  Bank,  like  fluctuations  in  international  financial  markets,  the  evolution  of  the  price  of  oil,
fiscal  policy,  and  developments  in  domestic  prices  and  costs.  Thus,  in  its  use  of  the  interest  rate
Norges Bank focuses on the preconditions for stability of the krone exchange rate over time.
The  interest  rate  affects  the  exchange  rate  directly  through  returns  on  holding  kroner,  but  also
indirectly through the effects of the interest rate on inflation and output. More specifically, stability of
the exchange rate requires that:
• 
• 
Price and cost inflation must be brought down to the level aimed at by euro countries.
Monetary  policy  must  not  in  itself  contribute  to  deflationary  recessions,  as  this  would
undermine confidence in the krone.
Let me explain in  more  detail.  Suppose  that  price  and  cost inflation  in  Norway  were allowed to  be
higher than in the euro countries. The nominal exchange rate would then have to depreciate in order to
keep the real exchange rate constant over time. Thus, stabilising inflation at around the level aimed at
by the ECB is a means of achieving exchange rate stability against the euro.
In a situation with the prospect of increased inflationary pressure and a depreciating exchange rate, an
increase in the interest rate may at the same time bring the exchange rate back towards its initial range
and reduce inflationary pressure through lower demand and lower imported goods inflation. This in
turn will contribute to long-run stability in the exchange rate. Similarly, with an appreciating exchange
rate  and  a  low  inflation  and  activity  level  in  the  economy,  a  lower  interest  rate  will  contribute  to
stabilising the exchange rate in both the short run and the long run through a stable inflation level.
On the other hand, we can think of situations where we would need to set a high interest rate in order
to keep the exchange rate close to the initial range in the short run, creating a deflationary recession in
the economy. Normally, a deflationary recession will lead to a weakened krone exchange rate, which
means that the high interest rate set to keep the level of the exchange rate unchanged in the short run in
itself will induce exchange rate instability in the long run. Similarly, the opposite situation may occur,
BIS Review 121/1999
10
where  a  low  interest  rate  is  required  to  keep  the  exchange  rate  stable  in  the  short  run,  creating
inflationary  pressure  in  the  economy.  In  both  situations,  however,  a  policy  aimed  at  stabilising  the
exchange  rate  in  the  short  run  will  weaken  the  basis  for  exchange  rate  stability  over  time.  Hence,
Norges  Bank  cannot  with  open  eyes  set  interest  rates  to  levels  where  monetary  policy  in  itself
contributes to a higher inflation or a deflationary recession, which would undermine the confidence of
the krone.

If  price  and  cost  inflation  is  in  line  with  the  level  aimed  at  by  the  euro  countries,  one  of  the
fundamental conditions for exchange rate stability is satisfied. In spite of this, the exchange rate may
be  perceived  as  “too  strong”  or  “too  weak”  in  relation  to  the  initial  range.  This  may  be  due  to
conditions  in  the  real  economy,  which  could  imply  a  real  appreciation  or  real  depreciation  of  the
krone. The background for such changes in the exchange rate may be that the cost competitiveness of
Norwegian industry has to be adjusted and that the equilibrium range of the krone exchange rate has
changed.  In  this  situation  Norges  Bank  should  carefully  evaluate  the  reasons  for  exchange  rate
movements.  If  we  have  reason  to  believe  that  the  exchange  rate  will  remain  permanently  strong  or
weak, Norges Bank will inform the authorities that measures other than those available to the Bank are
required.
We  note,  however,  that  the  present  exchange  rate  level  has  more  or  less  prevailed  for  more  than
10 years. On the basis of its analyses, Norges Bank does not find grounds for regarding this level as
inappropriate.
How does the Norwegian regime differ from inflation targeting?
9.
Price stability is an important part of long-term exchange rate stability, and the setting of interest rates
will often be the same whether the goal is exchange rate or inflation targeting. However, Norwegian
monetary policy differs in some respects from monetary policy in countries with an inflation target.
• 
Norway  has  a  long  tradition  of  cooperation  between  the  political  authorities  and  social
partners.  Income  and  wage  determination  is  fairly  centralised,  and  the  social  partners
evaluate the effects of wage outcomes on employment.
 In a number of countries that have switched to a monetary policy regime based on inflation
targeting, fiscal policy is oriented towards reducing government debt and deficits. A passive
fiscal policy implies that in practice monetary policy assumes a greater role in stabilising the
11
BIS Review 121/1999
(cid:127)
economy.  In  Norway  fiscal  policy  has  an  important  role  in  demand  management.  The
fulfilment of this task is facilitated by the fact that the Norwegian government has  greater
financial  leeway  than  most  other  countries  due  to  its  oil  revenues.  Fiscal  policy  has  been
fairly  well  adapted  to  the  economic  situation  over  the  last  decade.  The  active  role  it  has
played  in  demand  management  has  functioned  as  an  anchor  for  fiscal  discipline.  The
Government Petroleum Fund is meant to be a buffer against changes in the terms of trade. In
other countries this role must be filled by the exchange rate.

– Tradition of co-operation between political authorities and
social partners
– Wage-setting considering employment effects

– Fiscal policy has financial leeway for stabilisation policy
– Petroleum Fund buffer against terms of trade variability, not
the exchange rate

  Monetary  policy  in  Norway  is  oriented  towards  stability  of  the  exchange  rate  and  not  an
explicit inflation target. The setting of interest rates will more or less be the same. Norges
Bank  focuses  on  keeping  a  low  rate  of  inflation  and  on  avoiding  a  situation  in  which
monetary  policy  in  itself  contributes  to  a  recession  that  may  threaten  the  fundamental
conditions for stability of the krone.
The  institutional  set-up  for  monetary  policy  in  Norway  is  different.  In  a  country  with
inflation targeting, the central bank will inform the political authorities if the inflation target
is  not  met.  In  Norway,  Norges  Bank  will  inform  the  authorities  that  measures  other  than
those available to the Bank are required if a situation arises where we are unable to return the
exchange rate to its initial range without causing inflation or a deflationary recession. This
implies a greater focus in the conduct of fiscal policy on factors that influence the exposed
sector of the economy. This is consistent with our concern that the economy may run into a
Dutch disease.
Economic developments
10.
From looking at the principles of Norwegian economic policy, let us turn to Norges Bank’s view of
the current situation. The high and steady rate of growth from 1992 and onwards has been moderated
this year. The overall picture indicates that the exchange rate is stable, while the economy is showing
signs of cooling off.

Each  quarter  Norges  Bank  presents  an  inflation  report  with  an  assessment  of  the  outlook  for  the
Norwegian  economy  and  for  price  inflation  for  the  next  two  years.  The  projections  in  the  Inflation
Report provide a basis for the Bank’s conduct of monetary policy.
The  Inflation  Report  published  in  September  indicates  that  price  and  cost  inflation  in  Norway  will
gradually  slow  to  the  level  aimed  at  in  the  euro  area.  Among  other  things,  this  is  based  on  the
assumption  that  growth  in  public  expenditure  will  be  approximately  in  line  with  the  trend  rate  of
growth in the mainland economy.
For 1999 Norges Bank expects a growth rate of ½%. Growth is anticipated to be low also next year
and  approach  trend  growth  in  2001.  Demand  growth  could  be  higher  than  expected,  which  would
contribute to maintaining the pressure in the labour market. Employment is still high and near capacity
level, while we see a tendency towards higher unemployment in sectors such as the construction and
engineering industries.

Inflation is expected to remain at around 2% for the next two years, with inflation rates of 2¼% this
year, 2% next year and 1¾% in 2001.
Chart 14  shows  the  key  technical  assumptions  underlying  Norges  Bank’s  projections.  Short-term
interest rates are assumed to move in line with market expectations, as reflected in forward rates in
September (Chart 15). According to market expectations, the differential against European rates will
narrow from the current level of a little more than 3 percentage points to around 1 percentage point at
the end of 2001. The krone exchange rate is assumed to be NOK 8.30 against the euro throughout the
projection period.
Developments,  as  indicated  by  Norges  Bank’s  analyses,  imply  that  there  is  little  room  for  further
decreases in interest rates. It is more likely that the next change will involve a reduction rather than an
increase. If developments are in line with expectations, any further reduction will, however, be smaller
than the reductions implemented so far.

Norges  Bank  has  changed  its  procedures  this  year.  The  goal  is  to  achieve  predictability  and
transparency. Each month the Executive Board of the Bank discusses monetary policy. The dates for
the monthly meetings are announced ahead of time. Changes in interest rates will normally be decided
at these meetings. After each meeting there is a press release at 2 p.m. and a press conference at 4 p.m.
The  quarterly  Inflation  Report  presents  analyses  that  provide  a  basis  for  the  Bank’s  conduct  of
monetary policy.
Additional information from Norges Bank in  English,  such  as  articles  and  speeches, is  available  on
Norges Bank’s website www.norges-bank.no.
Conclusions
11.
Oil and gas provide substantial wealth for the Norwegian economy, while fluctuations in the price of
oil give rise to variations in the value of this wealth. Norwegian economic policy is organised so as to
maintain stability in the face of these variations.
Fiscal policy carries a responsibility for stabilising the real economy, while monetary policy is aiming
at  price  stability  and  preventing  a  deflationary  recession  with  a  view  to  maintaining  exchange  rate
stability over time.
Changes in the price of oil may influence expectations about future economic development in Norway
independently of how much of the petroleum revenues are absorbed into the economy in the short run.
However,  successful  use  of  the  Petroleum  Fund  will  provide  financial  leeway  for  an  active
stabilisation policy, the redistribution of wealth between generations and to a large extent protect the
Norwegian economy from oil price fluctuations.
