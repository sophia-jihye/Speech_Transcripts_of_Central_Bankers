Mr Garganas looks at the challenges for Greek monetary policy
on the eve of euro-zone entry
Address  by  Mr  Nicholas  C  Garganas,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Greece,  at  the  Euromoney
International Bond Congress, held in London on 15 February 2000.
 It is a great pleasure on the occasion of the Euromoney International Bond Congress to be given this
opportunity  to  speak  to  you  about  recent  developments  in  the  Greek  economy  and  I  would  like  to
thank  Eurobank  and  Deutsche  Bank  for  having  invited  me  here  tonight.  I  believe  that  this  is  a
particularly interesting time for Greece as she prepares for entry into the euro-zone on 1 January 2001.
I want to begin by looking at the impressive progress made by the Greek economy over recent years
before going on to discuss some of the challenges which monetary policy, in particular, faces over the
coming months.
In  recent  years  economic  policy  in  Greece  has  been  oriented  towards  achieving  a  high  degree  of
sustainable  economic  convergence  and  fully  satisfying  the  criteria  set  by  the  Maastricht  Treaty  for
participation  in  the  third  stage  of  EMU  by  the  time  compliance  is  examined  in  2000.  Fiscal  and
monetary  policies  were  implemented  vigorously  and  the  targets  of  the  last  two  convergence
programmes were met, thus placing Greece directly on the road to joining the euro-zone by 1 January
2001.
Three  of  the  four  convergence  criteria  of  Article  109j(1)  of  the  Treaty  -  the  government  budgetary
position and public debt, the exchange rate and long-term interest rates - are already  fully  satisfied,
and the fourth - the criterion on price stability - will be fulfilled by the end of this month.
On 29 November 1999, the Ecofin Council abrogated its decision that an excessive deficit existed in
Greece; indeed, the general government deficit reached 2.5% of GDP in 1998, well below the Treaty
reference value. In 1999, the general government deficit was further reduced to 1.5% of GDP, below
the  projection  of  the  1999  budget.  Cyclical  adjustment  of  the  government  balance  shows  that  the
budgetary position of Greece has already  been  in  compliance  with the requirements  of the  Stability
and Growth Pact from 1999. As can be seen from Figure 1, left hand scale, in 1993 the deficit was
13.8% of GDP.

BIS Review 20/2000
The  debt-to-GDP  ratio  peaked  at  111.6%  in  1993  (Figure  1,  right  hand  scale),  was  broadly  stable
thereafter, and started to decline in 1997. It was reduced by 3.1 percentage points in 1998 and a further
1.2  percentage  points  in  1999,  despite  some  additions  of  below-the-line  debits.  At  about  104%  of
GDP, its level is still very high, but is now very firmly on a downward path.
With  regard  to  the  criterion  on  exchange  rate  stability,  the  Maastricht  Treaty  stipulates  that  the
criterion will be satisfied if “a Member State has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided
for  by  the  exchange-rate  mechanism  (ERM)  of  the  European  Monetary  System  without  severe
tensions for at least two years before the examination” of compliance with the convergence criteria.
The drachma entered the ERM in March 1998 at a central rate of 357 per ECU, just over 12% below
the  market  rate prevailing  at  the  time.  As  from  January  1999,  it  joined  ERM  II  at  a  central  rate  of
353.109 per euro, with the standard fluctuation band of plus or minus 15%.
High  interest  rate  differentials  and  favourable  expectations  concerning  Greece’s  convergence
prospects  resulted  in  large  capital  inflows.  As  can  be  seen  from  Figure  2,  the  drachma  appreciated
(first against the ECU, and since January 1999 against the euro) and traded at around 7% above its
central rate for the best part of 1999. The central rate of the drachma was revalued by 3.5% against the
euro on 15 January this year. The new central rate of the drachma is 1 euro=340.75 drachma, and the
standard fluctuation band of plus or minus 15% continues to be observed around the central rate.

These developments in the exchange rate, presented in Figure 3, indicate that the Greek drachma has
successfully participated in the ERM for two years without experiencing any severe tensions during
the  period  under  review.  Throughout,  the  drachma  has  been  above  its  central  rate,  reflecting  the
favourable conditions in the Greek economy. Therefore, in my view, Greece fulfils the exchange rate
criterion.
Financial  markets  have  reacted  favourably  to  Greece’s  good  convergence  prospects  and  the  spread
between the 10-year yield on government bonds and German bunds in February was around 98 basis
points, compared with 196 basis points in March 1999 and 425 basis points in September 1998. The
12-month moving average of the yield on 10-year government bonds, used to test for convergence, has
been  below  the  reference  value  (derived  from  the  average  interest  rates  in  France,  Germany  and
Austria, the three  best  performing  Member  States  in  terms  of  price  stability)  since  November  1999
(Chart 4), and therefore Greece fulfilled the criterion on the convergence of interest rates.

Progress towards  price  stability  is  also  very  substantial. The  objective  of  the  Bank  of  Greece  is  for
consumer price increases not exceeding 2%. This target was reached in August 1999. The annual rate
of inflation was 2 percent in terms of the national CPI, which corresponds to 1.5% for the harmonised
index of consumer prices. Recent price developments (Chart 5) suggest that while the downward trend
in headline inflation has been reversed since October 1999, partly as a result of rising oil prices, the
underlying trend was still declining in December 1999. Headline inflation eased to 2.6% in January
2000  on  an  annual  basis,  from  2.7%  in  December  1999,  while  the  underlying  index  edged  up
marginally  from  1.8%  in  December  1999  to  1.9%  in  January  2000  (see  Chart 5).  The  harmonised
index  of  consumer  prices  has  been  converging  rapidly  since  the  beginning  of  1999  (Figure  6),
exceeding  the  reference  value  by  only  0.2  percentage  points  in  January  2000,  down  from  2.5
percentage  points  in  January  1998.  Although  the  increase  in  oil  prices  has  been  slowing  down  the
process of disinflation in recent months, current projections suggest that, in the 12 months ending in
February  2000,  Greece  should  have  an  average  rate  of  inflation,  on  a  harmonised  basis,  below  the
reference value (Figure 6).
The fall in inflation was achieved under conditions of accelerating economic growth and rising real
incomes. As can be seen from Figure 7, GDP grew at 3.5% in 1999 - the third successive year above
3% and the fourth year of growth faster than the EU average. Real convergence with our European
partners is expected to continue, with growth of 3.8% projected for 2000 and over 4% for 2001.

One  area  in  which  performance  is  not  satisfactory  is  the  labour  market.  Unemployment  is  at  about
10.5% of the labour force, above the EU average (Figure 7).

Although employment has been growing steadily, the labour force is also growing fast as a result of
large immigration and increasing participation. Last year, the government adopted a National Action
Plan  for  Employment,  which  relies  on  a  range  of  intensive  employment  -  enhancing  measures.
However, it is somewhat too early to assess the effectiveness of these measures.

The peaks in the second quarter of 1994 and the fourth quarter of 1997 are due to high interest rates
because of speculative pressures against drachma in May 1994 and October 1997.

So much for recent developments and the results that Greece has already achieved in the convergence
process. Let us now look at the challenges ahead.
In  the  coming  months,  the  main  challenge  for  economic  policy  in  Greece  will  be  to  secure  the
sustainability of the ongoing disinflation process so as to ensure a smooth transition to the common
currency within a healthy growth environment.
Progress towards price stability reflects a number of important policy choices, most notably the tight
stance  of  monetary  policy  adopted  to  date,  centered  on  high  short-term  interest  rates  and  a  strong
drachma (Figure 8). The reduction in inflation is also supported by the tight stance of fiscal policy and
by  the  slowdown  in  the  growth  rate  of  unit  labour  costs  (Figure  9).  Unit  labour  costs  registered  a
substantial deceleration following the two-year wage agreement, signed in the private sector in May
1998. Unit labour costs in the whole economy increased by 2.5% in 1999, down from 5.5% in 1998
and 8.4% in 1997. In the manufacturing sector the deceleration was more pronounced as a result of
improving productivity (Figure 9).
As the changeover to the euro approaches, so domestic short-term interest rates will have to align with
those  in  the  euro-zone  and  the  exchange  rate  converge  to  its  central  ERM  parity.  Table  1  provides
some indication of the gap between official interest rates in Greece and those in the euro-zone. The
consequence of convergence is that monetary conditions will inevitably loosen. The question  which
clearly  arises  therefore  is  the  extent  to  which  this  development  represents  a  possible  threat  to  the
sustainability of price stability.
A useful point which  can be  made  at  the  outset  is  that the impact  of  monetary  policy  loosening  on
inflation may well be diminished by the openness of the financial system in Greece, the dampening
effect on household incomes of decreasing yields on financial assets and the fact that economic agents
have already anticipated the fall in domestic short-term interest rates. However, this is not to say that
the Bank is not taking the issue seriously. On the contrary, we are carefully monitoring the situation.

Indeed,  the  Bank  supported  fully  the  recent  3.5%  revaluation  of  the  drachma  central  rate  within
ERM II. By reducing the amount of exchange rate convergence required, this step will considerably
reduce the foreseeable negative effect on domestic inflation. It is now expected that the depreciation
that will occur until the end of this year will have little impact on inflation. Last week the drachma
traded  at  around  2.25%  above  its  new  central  ERM  parity.  The  impact  of  a  depreciation  of  the
drachma towards its central ERM parity is negligible: given that the share of imports in consumption
is about 22% in Greece, the depreciation of the drachma required for it to reach its central parity is
estimated to imply an acceleration in consumer price inflation of not more than 0.4 of a percentage
point.
Developments  after  the  March  1998  devaluation  provide  evidence  of  Greece’s  ability  to  absorb
external  shocks  and  to  implement  non-accommodating  policies  when  required.  Aggregate  demand
slowed down as a result of restrictive fiscal and incomes policies, though a tight stance of monetary
policy still had a central role in containing pressure on prices.

The  revaluation  has  facilitated  some  convergence  of  interest  rates  by  allowing  a  reduction  without
implying a loosening of the overall stance of monetary policy.

Developments in interest rates and the exchange rate since the revaluation of the central parity suggest
that  markets  largely  discounted  the  effects  of  the  revaluation  (Chart 10).  A  downward  trend  in  the
3-month  Athibor-Euribor  differential  was  noticeable  from  the  third  week  of  November  onwards.
Developments in the foreign exchange  market  were  broadly  similar,  with  concerns  about  whether  a
central rate adjustment would occur and, if so, its extent, along with seasonal factors, causing some
weakening of the drachma in December. Following the revaluation, the market adjusted quickly with
the implied December 2000 forward rate moving to the new central rate of 340.75 drachmas per euro.
Thus the revaluation, in combination with the fact that interest rate declines have already been largely
discounted,  suggest  that  the  impact  of  the  monetary  policy  “shock”  will  be  considerably  less  than
initially anticipated. Overall, it is not now expected that it will be very significant. That having been
said, however, interest rate policy in the remainder of the year will proceed cautiously. The timing and
magnitude  of  changes  in  interest  rates  by  the  Bank  of  Greece  will  be  dictated  by  developments  in
inflation and the evolution of the exchange rate. We intend to ensure a smooth transition to euro-zone
membership in both money and foreign exchange markets.
In view of the forthcoming easing of monetary policy, other policies - notably, fiscal policy, but also,
wage and structural  policies  -  will  become  the pre-eminent  instrument  available  to  counter  possible
inflationary pressures and ensure sustainability of low inflation.
The new convergence programme which was recently presented to and accepted by the Ecofin Council
envisages a further tightening of fiscal policy, targeting a general government deficit of 1.2% of GDP
for this year and a primary surplus of 6.7%. For 2001, the target deficit is 0.2%, followed by a small
surplus in the following year. The general government primary surplus is projected to rise again to 7%
of  GDP  for  both  years. Maintaining  the level of the  primary  surplus  may  become  the  most  reliable
policy instrument available to hold back demand and ensure price stability.
As regards wage developments, the updated Greek convergence  programme  implies  moderate  wage
increases in the public sector in 2000 and beyond. The conditions of the renewal of the two-year wage
agreement  for  the  private  sector  that  has  just  lapsed  are  of  particular  importance.  As  I  mentioned
earlier  wage  moderation  was  a  key  factor  that  contributed  to  lowering  inflation  and  inflationary
expectations in the aftermath of the 1998 devaluation,  suggestive  of  an incipient culture  of  stability
that will be essential in the forthcoming wage negotiations. A credible targeting of inflation and the
maintenance of the announced target in all circumstances have also created a favourable climate that
BIS Review 20/2000

may  positively  affect  the  outcome  of  the  impending  wage  agreement.  The  behaviour  of  economic
agents might also be influenced by awareness of the consequence of a regime change: the exchange
rate  instrument  will  no  longer be  available as  a  solution  to  competitiveness  losses  once  Greece  has
become a full member of the euro-zone.
Finally,  deregulation  and  structural  reform  aimed  at  enhancing  competition  and  improving  the
functioning  of individual  markets (the  goods,  services,  capital  and  labour  markets)  are  also  helping
price  stability.  In  this  context,  it  is  important  to  mention  that  key  sectors  of  the  economy,  such  as
electricity  and  fixed  telephony,  are  programmed  to  be  opened  to  competition  as  from  2001  in
accordance with an EU timetable.  Additionally,  conditions on  the  supply  side  of  the  economy  have
been  improving  in  recent  years.  The  acceleration  of  private  capital  formation,  the  improvement  in
infrastructure and the structural reforms (including privatisations) implemented so far have most likely
increased the productive potential of the economy.
To  conclude,  the  Greek  economy  has  come  a  long  way  over  the  recent  past.  Tight  monetary  and
exchange rate policies have been instrumental in fighting inflation. The inevitable reduction in interest
rates implied  by  participation in the  euro-zone  and  a  return  of  the  drachma  to  its  central  ERM  rate
would represent an easing of monetary conditions with a foreseeable impact on inflation. I have tried
to  argue  today  that  the  inflationary  impact  of  gradual  interest  rate  and  exchange  rate  convergence
should not be very significant. The support of other policies, in particular, further fiscal consolidation,
persisting  wage  moderation  and  continued  progress  towards  structural  reform  should  prevent  any
significant  inflationary  pressure  resurgence  when  monetary  policy  eases  and  ensure  a  smooth
transition  to  the  euro  on  1  January  2001.  The  outlook  for  Greece  once  in  the  euro-zone  is  good,
suggesting that in the long run she will be in a position to reap the full benefits of EMU membership.
