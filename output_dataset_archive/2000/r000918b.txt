Ian Macfarlane: Recent major developments in the Australian economy
Talk  by  Mr  Ian  Macfarlane,  Governor  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Australia,  to  the  World  Economic
Forum Asia Pacific Economic Summit Melbourne, on 11 September 2000.
 It is a pleasure to be speaking before the World Economic Forum again. I have done so before in Hong
Kong and Singapore, and I am proud that I can now add Melbourne to the list. It is also very pleasing
that the Forum has successfully expanded beyond its Davos base, and made the Asia Pacific region an
important part of its operations.
In the short time I have available tonight, I would like to outline some of the major developments in
the  Australian  economy  over  recent  years,  and  then  say  a  few  words  about  the  outlook.  Where
possible, I will compare our performance to that of other countries. Inevitably, I will make a number
of comparisons with the United States as it is the yardstick by which everyone’s performance seems to
be judged these days.
I will take as my starting point a comparison of economic growth rates of developed countries over the
most recent decade (Column 1 of Table 1). These figures from the OECD show that except for Ireland,
which  is  a  very  special  case,  the  Australian  growth  rate  has  been  higher  than  for  any  comparable
OECD  country.  For  me,  the  interesting  thing  about  this  table  is  that  this  is  the  first  decade  in  my
working life where Australia has figured in the top half of the table, let alone being virtually in the top
position.
Incidentally, these figures cover the whole decade and so include a recession for each country, usually
in the early part of the decade. This holds the average growth rates down. Another approach would be
to look at growth rates during current expansions. Up to the current quarter, our expansion has lasted
37 quarters and averaged growth of 4.1% per annum: the comparable figures for the United States are
38 quarters and 3.7% per annum.
If we turn to an international ranking of inflation rates over the past decade (Column 2 of Table 1),
Australia finishes in the middle of the field, with an average inflation rate of 2.3% per annum. This is a
huge improvement on recent decades, but, of course, virtually every country has shown a significant
improvement. There are a number of factors behind this improvement, but one I would like to mention
today  is  our  monetary  policy  regime.  Like  a  number  of  countries  in  the  above  list,  Australia  has  a
monetary  policy  regime  which  is based  on  the  trilogy  of  an  inflation  target,  an  independent  central
bank and a floating exchange rate.
An important factor behind our good growth and low inflation has been our productivity performance.
Here,  if  we  use  the  simplest  measure  of  productivity,  which  is  labour  productivity,  the  pattern  in
Australia is very similar to the pattern in the United States (Graph 1): strong growth in the 1960s, a
flattening out in the 1970s and 1980s, followed by a pick-up in growth in the 1990s. But the pick-up in
the  1990s  in  Australia  has  been  more  pronounced  than  in  the  United  States.  We  have  gone  from
growth of 1.7% per annum to 3.0% per annum, whereas the United States went from growth of 1.5 er
cent per annum to 2% per annum.
I do not want to suggest that this means we have higher productivity than the United States; remember
we  are  only  talking  here  about  rates  of  change  of  productivity.  The  fact  that  we  have  been  able  to
speed up more than they have is, in large part, because we were starting from a lower base.
Incidentally, the OECD recently completed a study called “Is There A New Economy?” in which it
looked at similar calculations to the ones I have shown above for a range of countries. It found that out
of the 29 OECD economies, only six  had  achieved  a  higher trend  growth of  GDP  per  capita in  the
1990s compared with the 1980s. They were the United States, Australia, Ireland, Denmark, Norway
and the Netherlands.

Whilst I am on the subject of productivity, I want to make two general points:
• 
The first is the obvious one which I have made on numerous occasions that the main reasons
behind the pick-up in productivity growth have been structural changes made over the past
15  years  in  the  Australian  economy  which  have  increased  flexibility  and  competitive
pressures. These changes include:
     further tariff reductions;
financial deregulation;
labour market deregulation;
privatisation; and
a more stringent regime of competition policy.
 It has not been easy to put these changes in place, even though there has been for most of the
decade  considerable  bipartisan  political  support  for  change.  Inevitably,  compromises  have
had to be made and, viewed in isolation, some of the individual changes do not look to be all
that  thorough-going.  But  taken  together,  I  think  the  total  is  larger  than  the  sum  of  the
individual  parts.  Of  course,  one  aspect  of  the  economy  that  was  not  reformed  during  the
period covered by these calculations was the tax system. But that finally changed a couple of
months  ago  when  a  Goods  and  Services  Tax  was  introduced  to  replace  the  old  wholesale
sales tax and to take some of the weight off income taxes.
The second point about productivity I want to make concerns the new economy/old economy
divide. Some people tend to judge a country’s technological sophistication by, for example,
the  number  of  listed  companies  in  the  IT  sector.  Although  Australia  has  a  number  of
companies that fit this description, about 70 or so in fact, their combined share of the stock
market is not large by international standards. But that is only one measure of technological
sophistication. Another equally important one is the country’s willingness to embrace new
technology. This may be a better guide to productivity improvements than focusing only on
the IT sector. I have two measures of the spread of technology:
  The first is Internet usage as a percentage of the population, which shows Australia in
a  relatively  high  position  among  the  countries  compiled  by  the  Consulting  Group,
NUA (Table 2).
A measure that is more specific to the business sector is the number of e-commerce
servers per head of population. On this measure, Australia is second only to the United
States (Table 3).

So, in terms of willingness to adapt to new information technology, Australia would get a very high
score. This, along with the measures I mentioned earlier, helps to explain why there has recently been
such a significant lift in the rate of growth of productivity.
A big lift in productivity growth has a beneficial effect on many areas of the economy. A lot of it is
passed through to consumers and, in the process, this makes it easier to maintain low inflation. Some
of it can also make businesses more profitable, which is, after all, the incentive that drives much of the
efforts  towards  improving  productivity  in  the  first  place.  The  two  broadest  measures  of  corporate
profits as a percentage of GDP in Australia have been trending up over the past decade, with profits
after interest showing a much sharper rise than profits before interest, again another indirect benefit of
a low inflation (Graph 2) decade.
With  good  growth  and  good  profitability,  businesses  have  been  keen  to  hire  staff.  As  a  result,
employment has grown strongly and the unemployment rate continues to decline (Graph 3). Again, a
comparison with the United States is interesting - during our expansion, the unemployment rate has
fallen by 4.8 percentage points compared with a fall of 3.7 percentage points for the United States. The
fact  that their level  of the  unemployment  rate,  at  4.1%,  is  lower  than  ours,  at  6.4%,  is  due  to  their
lower starting point, in part a result of the relatively mild nature of their early 1990s recession.

There are two other things I wish to touch on before concluding. The first is the exchange rate, which
has attracted a lot of attention and soul searching this year. It is surprising that in an economy showing
the medium-term characteristics I have just outlined, the exchange rate is so weak. If we refocus our
attention to the immediate period, the puzzle is, if anything, greater. We have an economy growing at
well over 4%, and probably more like 5%, with exports rising rapidly in the context of the strongest
world growth for a decade, rising commodity prices and high corporate profitability.
Why markets are placing such a low valuation on the Australian dollar is not a question I can easily
answer, any more than I can answer why valuations in some equity markets seem so high relative to
normal. These things can occur for periods in markets. They eventually come out right in most cases,
but it can take some time, and in the meantime the effect can be uncomfortable, unhelpful and even
damaging.  For  my  part,  I  think  that  an  important  contributing  factor  this  time  is  that  markets
underestimated  (and  are  still  underestimating)  the  Australian  economy’s  underlying  strength.  The
coincidence of a strong world economy plus a low Australian dollar is virtually unprecedented, and is
one  of  the  several  reasons  why  we  at  the  Reserve  Bank  have  been  confident  in  the  strength  of  the
Australian economy.
The influence of the world economy has been quite expansionary for Australia over the past year, most
notably  in  the  form  of  a  28%  increase  in  exports.  This  has  been  the  result  of  both  strong  volume
growth and rising prices. Even with substantial growth in imports, the foreign balance is now making a
good  contribution  to  Australian  growth  and,  at  the  same  time,  reducing  the  current  account  deficit
(Graph 4).
The reduction in the current account deficit from 6% of GDP a few quarters ago to 4.9% now may not
look to be a big story. However, what is unusual about it is that it has occurred at a time when the
Australian economy has been growing strongly. In all other instances where a turnaround of this size
has  occurred,  a  major  cause  has  been  a  slowdown  or  contraction  in  the  Australian  economy  (and
consequent fall in imports). On this occasion, the manner of the improvement in the current account
portends much better for the future.
Conclusion
We are now in the tenth year of our current expansion, and are in much better shape than in the mature
phase  of  previous  expansions.  This  year  is  an  eventful  one  in  that  it  contains  a  number  of  one-off
occurrences such as the Y2K changeover, the introduction of the GST and, in a few days, the Olympic
Games.  These  events  have  the  effect  of  adding  to  demand  and  of  shifting  it  around  from  month  to
month and quarter to quarter. This is making a number of indicators of the economy more difficult to

read  than  normal,  but  I  do  not  think  it  alters  the  overall  assessment  that  this  is  an  economy  which
retains  a  fair  bit  of  momentum,  and  where  the  economic  fundamentals,  both  here  and  abroad,  are
continuing to provide a stimulus to growth.
