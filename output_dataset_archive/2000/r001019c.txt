Kerstin Hessius: The new economy seen from a central bank perspective
Speech by  Ms  Kerstin  Hessius,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  a  seminar  on  the  IT
revolution  and  the  new  economy,  organised  by  Skandinaviska  Enskilda  Banken  Institutionell
Förvaltning, at Moderna Museet Stockholm, on 12 October 2000.
 I  would  like  to  begin  by  thanking  the  organisers  for  choosing  such  a  stimulating  and  appropriate
environment for this seminar as Moderna Museet. If there is one place where you can see the effect of
structural change, it is in art.
A country’s economy is constantly subjected to changes, which lead to new structures. However, this
is  nothing  new.  Every  time  an  economy  has  undergone  significant  structural  changes,  it  has  been
regarded as a new economy. In many ways today’s “new economy” can be seen as one of many such
major structural changes. Nor is there any accepted definition of the “new economy” concept; what I
am referring to is primarily an increase in the growth potential of the economy.
“Multiplied intellectual capacity”
The new information technology and the internet have revolutionised the methods in which we work,
shop and communicate today. As someone once said, it is as though IT multiplies intellectual capacity
in the same way that the industrial revolution multiplied physical  capacity.  In  addition,  the  costs  of
using the new intellectual capacity have fallen drastically over a short period of time, which facilitates
a rapid dissemination.
However, from a historical point of view, it is only when technological advances have made a general
impact  on  the  production  process  that  productivity  gains  will  arise.  The  steam  engine  moved
production  from  household  to  factory,  the railway  enabled  wider  markets  to  develop  and  electricity
brought the conveyer belt. Computers and the internet enable a more effective flow of information at
almost  all  stages;  financing,  projection,  follow-up,  stock  management,  procurement,  negotiation,
auction,  verification,  invoicing,  auditing,  requisitioning  and  distribution.  Furthermore,  the  improved
access to information contributes to a reduction in the risks when outsourcing parts of the company’s
operations.
More efficient markets - the “naked economy”
Increased access to information means that the markets - the matching processes between buyers and
sellers - also  become  more  efficient.  Some  people  therefore  call  the  new  economy  the  “naked
economy”.  We  can  use  the  internet  to  search  for  products  and  compare  prices,  which  brings  down
transaction costs and new companies find it easier to get into the market.
A good example of this is how the matching process on the labour market is facilitated by information
technology. In the USA around 80% of personnel managers are said to use the internet and one of the
largest employment agencies on the internet advertises more than one million jobs.1 Four hundred of
the  world’s  500  largest  companies  use  web  sites  in  their  recruitment  process.  These  internet
employment agencies probably reduce the search costs and facilitate the matching process - reducing
what is known as friction unemployment.

This has a particularly strong impact when it occurs in conjunction with lower trade barriers and an
increased exchange of trade. A popular example of the new international business to business is the
joint  electronic  marketplace  planned  by  the  world’s  leading  car  manufacturers.  This  is  estimated  to
achieve  a  turnover  of  USD  250  billion  and  to  cover  60,000  sub-contractors.  Electronic  trading  in
components in the motor vehicle industry is estimated to be able to reduce the cost of producing a car
by almost 15%.2
The  new  internet  markets  will  naturally  lead  to  stiffer  competition.  Sub-contractors  will  experience
fewer barriers to entering markets and the price picture will become more transparent. This means that
strong suppliers will be able to push out weaker ones more quickly and sub-contractors’ margins will
in general be put under pressure - the producer surplus will decline for the benefit of the consumers
and prices will fall. Suppliers will be forced to rationalise and to improve in order to maintain their
margins. The stiffer competition among those who remain will be the driving force behind continued
growth in productivity.
How IT will boost growth
The more efficient production process and markets are both examples of boosts to productivity that
will temporarily increase growth. A simple way of describing this is to imagine the new technologies
and more efficient markets causing the path of the long-term potential GDP to shift outwards. This is
done by growth strongly accelerating (see slide 1A). However, when the technological revolution has
subsided, the boost in growth will also subside.
However, it is not self-evident that there is some form of “natural” growth rate to return to. Over a
long-term perspective the growth rate has both varied and accelerated. I therefore intend to take up the
other possible angle of approach sometimes mentioned, that IT could raise growth permanently. This
could only be achieved by the technological innovations also creating the right conditions for a more
rapid development in technology in the future (see slide 1B). One example of this type of development
is what is known as Moore’s Law. It is now 25 years ago that Gordon Moore, the founder of Intel,
predicted that  the  capacity  of  a  microprocessor  would  double  every  18  months.  So  far  he  has  been
proved  right  and  many  believe  that  Moore’s  forecast  may  hold  true  far  into  the  2010s.  However,
despite the fact that certain technological indicators, such as the number of patents granted, indicate an
increasingly  rapid  development  in  the  USA  and  Sweden,  it  is  difficult  to  believe  in  a  perpetual
technological acceleration.
From  a  central  bank  perspective,  we  can  probably  keep  our  distance  to  this  debate  by  reminding
everyone  that  our  monetary  policy  goal  horizon  is  one  to  two  years.  It  suffices  to  imagine  that  the
adaptation periods between the first and second dotted-line curve (in slide 1A) will take perhaps five
to 10 years. From this perspective the question of whether IT developments will lead to a temporary or
permanent increase in the growth rate is of mainly academic interest.

In this context, it may be appropriate to dismiss some prejudices about macro-models. Many believe
that these models will become unusable and outdated in a “new economy”, but that is not the case.
When  structural  changes  take  place,  forecasts  based  on  historical  estimates  naturally  become  more
uncertain.  It  is  therefore  reasonable  to  attach  greater  importance  on  these  occasions  to  recent
information and indicators. But the models need not be assessed on historical data. In actual fact the
models’  parameters  can  be  “calibrated”  in  such  a  way  that  their  properties  closely  agree  with  the
conception of the way the economy functions. This conception can, of course, be based on historical
connections,  but  can  equally  well  be  based  on  information  not  contained  in  historical  data.  The
models  are in actual fact  an  important tool  in  testing  whether  historically  assessed  connections  still
apply and play an important role in signalling significant structural changes.
What does the data in the USA say?
What information does factual data actually give us? Without doubt there is a clear break in the GDP
growth trend in the USA, which has been much higher during the second half of the 1990s than during
the 1970s and 1980s. The fact that this has occurred without any corresponding increase in inflationary
pressure indicates that there has been an increase in the economy’s long-term production capacity. But
should this really be regarded as a “new” economy? In actual fact, the growth rate in recent years does
not appear unusually high when seen in a perspective of 40-50 years. On the contrary, it is the growth
rate during the 1970s and 1980s which appears to be unusually low.
What  really  makes  the  1990s  in  the  USA  unique  is  the  course  of  the  economic  upswing,  its  long
duration and especially the developments in productivity. Growth in productivity has largely increased
over  time,  instead  of  decreasing,  as  has  been  the  case  in  previous  periods  of  economic  upswing
(slide 2).
There has been an intense debate among leading US economists over the past year as to whether this
increase in productivity merely reflects greater productivity in the manufacture of computers and other
IT equipment, or whether this IT capital also has a spread effect to other parts of the economy. No one
questions  the  fact  that  productivity  in  the  actual  manufacture  of  computers  and  IT  equipment  has
increased.  There  has  been  an  increase  of  almost  25%  a  year  in  this  field  during  the  1990s.  The
dissension concerns the spread effects.

The background to this scepticism regarding the effects of IT on the rest of the economy lies in the
“Solow paradox”. Nobel prizewinner Robert Solow stated in 1987 that “we see computers everywhere
but not in the productivity statistics”. This was true until the mid-1990s.

Now, however, the effects of computers are beginning to show in the statistics and this paradox could
be dismissed. Stephen Oliner and Daniel Sichel at the Federal Reserve in Washington3 have made an
in-depth  analysis.  This  is  based  on  the  fact  that  the  productivity  trend  has  increased  by  just  over
1 percentage point during the latter part of the 1990s and they conclude that IT actually accounts for
most of the growth in productivity. Just under half of the total increase results from investments in IT.
The remainder is the result of a more rapid increase in total factor productivity (TFP), that is to say,
the part considered to be due to factors such as technology and organisation (slide 3). Half of this part

can be attributed to the production of IT products, but the remainder - corresponding to one third of a
percentage point of the total increase - is attributable to a generally higher level of efficiency  in the
economy  as  a  whole.  Other  studies  have  produced  similar  results.  However,  the  question  of  how
strong a relation this has to IT is still open. There are probably a number of factors working together in
this process, such as deregulation, increased competition, a higher average level of education, etc.
The new economy in Sweden
While many people are wondering whether what has happened in the USA can really reach Europe, it
cannot be denied that Sweden is showing many similarities. The good growth rate in recent years and
low prices provide food for thought.
Firstly,  a  few  words  on  the  conditions  in  Sweden  compared  with  the  USA.  Here  I  am  not  merely
talking about the most fundamental factor, ie a broad base of well-educated labour. Price stability and
healthy public finances are also important conditions for providing  a  “new  economy”  with  growing
power.  In  addition,  strategically  important  markets,  such  as  telecommunications  and  broadcasting
media have been opened up to competition.
It  is  especially  important that  Sweden  had a  broad  base  of  users  of  various  technical  systems  at  an
early stage. A broad base is essential for users and producers to gain a real exchange from working in
the  networks  comprised  by  the  new  technology.  Ericsson’s  successful  broadening  of  its  operations
from  fixed  to  mobile  telephony  and  Sweden’s  rapid  licensing  of  first  NMT  and  then  GSM  gave
Sweden one of the world’s broadest bases of mobile phone users. The subsidised provision of personal
computers  to  employees  also  broadened  the  user  base  and  gave  Sweden  the  highest  PC  density  in
Europe.  This  of  course  facilitated  the  use  of  the  internet  and  thus  the  general  e-mail  revolution  in
Swedish  companies  and  homes.  The  combination  of  internet  usage  and  the  high  density  of  mobile
phones  means that  mobile internet,  despite  its slow  start,  has  already  come  further  here  than  in  the
USA.  Slide  4  shows  a  summary  of  Sweden’s  position  in  various  technological,  network-based
systems.  As  the  internet  is  still  in  a  phase  of  development,  these  figures  can  primarily  serve  as
indicators of future growth.

However, Sweden’s relatively high growth rate and low inflation rate can at the same time be partly
explained by the fact that we are still absorbing spare resources and labour laid off in connection with
the crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. The gap between actual and potential growth does not appear
to be completely closed, while the Riksbank and others perceive that this gap is well and truly closed
in the USA.

BIS Review 89/2000
There  are  thus  a  few  pieces  of  the  puzzle  remaining  before  we  can  feel  convinced  that  Sweden  is
moving  towards  a  US  development:  how  large  is  the  IT  sector  in  the  Swedish  economy?  How
important is the IT sector to the rest of the Swedish economy? What does IT mean to productivity in
Sweden? Unfortunately I have to say now that we know too little about this.
We know that productivity in Sweden has developed unevenly during the 1990s - a disjointed period
disturbed  by  a  bank  crisis,  currency  crisis  and  problems  with  public  finances.  Investment  has
developed more weakly than in the USA, although it has picked up in recent years. Capital intensity
does not, therefore, explain the growth in productivity. What does become more evident, on the other
hand,  is  a  break  in  trend  in  that  part  of  productivity  attributed  to  technology  and  more  efficient
organisation, ie total factor productivity TFP (slide 5). This showed a weak and tentative development
up to the mid-1990s, but has really picked up over the last five years.

This  picture  is  also  supported  by  studies  from  the  OECD  (slide  6).  A  comparison  of  the  different
countries  shows  that  Sweden,  along  with  the  USA,  Finland  and  Australia,  has  had  the  highest
technology content (TFP) in growth, while other countries have grown through using more labour or
capital.
What we still do not know is how large and how important the IT sector actually is in Sweden. One
problem is that Statistics Sweden, which otherwise makes in-depth studies of many social phenomena,
cannot  discern investments  in  IT - much  less adjust  the  price of  these  investments  against  the  rapid
qualitative development that constantly raises the performance of IT. It is necessary to obtain statistics
in this field in order to calculate where productivity is coming from and how it is spread on, as Oliner
and  Sichel  have  calculated  in  the  USA.  The  Riksbank  therefore  welcomes  Statistics  Sweden’s
announcement of a report on IT-related statistics and hopes to see concrete results.

Meanwhile,  there  have  been  passable  attempts  from  various  quarters  to  bridge  over  the  gap  in  the
statistics.  The  OECD  has  made  a  comparison  of  IT  investments  over  one  year  between  countries,
which clearly places Sweden at the top of the list, together with the USA (slide 7). In addition, there
are approximate calculations on expenditure on software which actually show a higher percentage in
relation to GDP in Sweden than in the USA.

However, in the work on the Riksbank’s Inflation Reports, there are factors that are easier to pick up.
One is of course the fall in computer prices. Prices have fallen by almost 35% a year since 1996. There
is even an element of “new economy” in the deregulation of the telecommunications and electricity
markets. Firstly, it would not have been so easy to implement the deregulation without the aid of the
new technology. Secondly, the deregulation might not have had the same impact without, for instance,
the information provided on the internet, which helped consumers in making a choice.
7
BIS Review 89/2000
All in all, I can allow myself to make a qualified guess on some areas, without knowing for certain:
1. 
Productivity, total factor productivity, has risen considerably in Sweden during the latter half
of the 1990s. The emergence of information technology has probably been significant in this.
2. 
3. 
The  effects  will  continue  to  be  felt  for  a  number  of  years,  probably  beyond  the  monetary
policy horizon, for which reason the Riksbank will continue to monitor the IT phenomenon
in future.
Deregulation and increased competition play a special role in Sweden, particularly as they
have run parallel to IT developments.
At the same time, there is reason to point out that the “new economy” does not constitute a guarantee
for a stable and positive development in asset prices, either in the USA or Sweden. On the contrary,
history shows that rapid  technological  changes  often lead  to  speculative  bubbles. This  was  the  case
after the emergence of the railway at the end of the 19th century and the crash of 1929 followed on
from  the  breakthrough  of  electricity  and  the  internal  combustion  engine  at  the  beginning  of  the
20th century. I do not intend to make an in-depth analysis of the causes here, but to point out that even
very  promising  developments  in  the  growth  of  productivity  can  live  up  to  the  profit  expectations
created during speculative bubbles.
Monetary policy implications
It  is  evident  that  large,  IT-driven  and  IT-supported  structural  changes  are  underway  and  that  these
affect  productivity  and  price  levels  in  a  way  that  needs  to  be  taken  into  account  when  assessing
inflationary pressure in the economy. We do not know how long the technological changes will have
an effect, but I have every reason to believe that IT will affect developments in Sweden for the next
few years, which basically comprises the monetary policy target horizon. On the other hand, there is in
my  opinion  nothing  to  indicate  that the “new  economy”  has  invalidated  any  fundamental  economic
connections.
At the same time, rapid changes such as those we are now experiencing involve greater uncertainty.
No one can say with any great precision how productivity will develop over the next few years and
how  large  a  role  IT  will  play  in  its  development.  This  uncertainty  is  enhanced  by  the  difficulty  in
measuring the IT sector’s significance as a result of shortcomings in Swedish statistics.
Uncertainty  over  the  total  effects  of  technological  developments  means  that  we  must  show  greater
sensitivity  when  formulating  monetary  policy.  Let  me  call  it  being  more  “reactive”  than  would
otherwise  have  been  the  case.  By  reactive,  I  mean  that  we  must  constantly  reconsider  our  earlier
assessments in the light of developments in the economy and the way the various parts actually react. I
maintain that this has in many ways been a characteristic of our Inflation Reports over the past year.
These  reflect  clearly  how  the  view  of  potential  growth  and  the  connection  between  inflation  and
growth have changed as a result of the Riksbank’s analyses and models taking account of structural
changes in their assessments.
The  repo  rate  could  not  have  remained  at  its  current  level  if  price  levels  had  not  been  affected  by
deregulation on several markets and the fact that we can see a positive development in productivity.
Then there are of course a number of other important factors that must be taken into account, labour
supply,  wage  formation,  international  price  developments  and,  in  particular,  confidence  in  the
monetary  policy.  However,  developments  in  productivity  will  continue  to  play  a  central  role  in  the
assessments.  The  Riksbank  monitors  the  various  signs  of  the  “new  economy”  and  takes  them  very
seriously.
