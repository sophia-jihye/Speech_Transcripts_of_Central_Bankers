Svein Gjedrem: Economic perspectives
Annual  address  by  Mr  Svein  Gjedrem,  Governor  of  the  Norges  Bank,  at  the  meeting  of  the
Supervisory Council of Norges Bank, Gausdal, 15 February 2001.
 Introduction
Norway’s  economy  is  today  characterised  by  substantial  petroleum  revenues,  sharp  growth  in
government  expenditure,  a  tight  labour  market  and  high  cost  inflation.  High  oil  prices  and  sizeable
petroleum production are contributing to surpluses on the current account and the central government
budget. This has also resulted in a vigorous rise in Norway’s disposable income. The current account
surplus in 2000, which was equivalent to about 14 per cent of GDP, is among the highest surpluses
recorded by an OECD country in the post-war period. The total general government budget surplus
also rose sharply, reaching 14½ per cent of GDP.

With the exception of a brief pause in growth from the summer of 1998, the Norwegian economy has
been expanding since 1993. Employment has risen and unemployment has fallen to just over 3 per
cent. A shortage of labour in many sectors has resulted in a relatively sharp growth in labour costs in
Norway.

Whereas the upturn was balanced for a long period, the public sector has laid claim to a large share of
the increase in the labour supply in recent years. Manufacturing employment has fallen markedly since
1998.
The  mainland  economy  features  some  aspects  that  are  associated  with  a  boom  period,  although
growth is low. After several years of mainland GDP growth in the order of 3-4 per cent, activity is now
increasing by less than 2 per cent a year. The economy is operating near capacity limits.
New working time reforms, increased use of sick pay and disability benefits and a reduced supply of
labour  from  other  Nordic  countries  are  restraining  growth  in  many  sectors.  Moreover,  there  is  no
evidence suggesting that  productivity  growth  in  Norway  has  picked  up  to  the  levels  in  some  of  our
neighbouring countries.

International  equity  prices  declined  sharply  last  autumn.  In  the  US,  output  and  employment  are
stagnating.  As  shown  in  the  chart,  the  risk  premium  in  capital  markets  on  long-term  credit  to
enterprises has increased. In addition, many international enterprises now have a poorer credit rating
than  earlier  This  has  also  affected  borrowing  in  Norwegian  companies,  which  now  have  to  place
greater emphasis on their customers’ ability to honour commitments. International financial and capital
markets are characterised by uncertainty and unrest.
This  unrest  is  not  found  among  economic  agents  in  Norway.  As  long  as  oil  prices  are  high,  the
Norwegian economy is fairly sheltered. Many central banks are now reducing their key rates. As our
economy is affected to a lesser extent, the differential between short rates in Norway and abroad may
widen.
Monetary policy
The  long-term  objective  of  monetary  policy  is  to  provide  the  Norwegian  economy  with  a  nominal
anchor – domestic price stability, and thereby the basis for a stable krone. Nominal stability is the best
contribution monetary policy can make to economic growth and prosperity. A nominal anchor is also a
necessary  precondition  for  stable  financial  markets  and  property  markets.  High  inflation  and  wide
swings  in  the  exchange  rate  impair  the  function  of  prices  as  an  information  vehicle.  This  leads  to
booms  followed  by  busts  and  an  arbitrary  redistribution  of  income  and  wealth.  Inflation  therefore
poisons the economy.
By  linking  movements  in  the  krone  to  the  euro,  we  have  chosen  to  follow  the  same  standard  for
nominal stability in the economy as set by the euro area countries.

Since 1997, inflation has been higher in Norway than in the euro area. The difference partly reflects a
period of strong growth in Norway, while the level of activity in Europe has been low. The higher level
of inflation in Norway cannot be sustained, however, as this would undermine the basis for stability in
the krone exchange rate and confidence in monetary policy.
Short-term capital inflows and outflows are probably the most important factor determining movements
in the krone exchange rate from day to day, from week to week and from one quarter to the next. They
are  governed  by  expectations  concerning  future  returns.  Changes  in  expectations  concerning  the
future value of the krone can trigger extensive capital movements.
As a rule, Norges Bank does not intervene in foreign exchange markets with a view to influencing the
krone exchange rate. The krone  is  floating,  and  the  value  of  the  krone  fluctuates  in  periods  by  the
same magnitude as exchange rates in other open economies. Nevertheless, the prevailing stability of
the krone is largely a reflection of confidence that inflation in Norway will be kept at a low level.
Our experience is that changes in the Norwegian interest rate level only have a predictable effect on
the  krone  exchange  rate  when  the  change  in  interest  rates  also  contributes  to  stabilising  inflation.
However, the relationship between interest rates and price and cost developments is uncertain. The
setting of interest rates thus requires the use of professional judgement and discretion. The basis for
exercising  discretion  is  subject  to  limitations,  however.  Should  any  doubt  arise  as  to  whether  the
interest rate is oriented towards nominal stability, this would trigger substantial capital movements.

An  inappropriate  setting  of  interest  rates  could  easily  jeopardise  financial  stability  in  the  domestic
economy. The experience of Norway and other countries shows that credit and property markets can
be  very  unstable.  If  interest  rates  are  kept  at  too  low  a  level  for  too  long,  credit  demand  will  rise
BIS Review 14/2001

sharply, as we witnessed in the 1980s. At that time, rising property prices generated expectations of
further price increases, which in turn led to rising credit demand. When the bubble burst, recession
ensued with falling asset values, a debt crisis and a growing number of bankruptcies. It is important to
bear in mind that this instability is inherent in financial and property markets. We cannot rely on the
memory of market participants.
Interaction with income formation
A precondition for a stable krone exchange rate  against  European currencies is that price and cost
inflation  in  Norway  must  over  time  not  exceed  the  corresponding  aim  for  inflation  of  the  European
Central  Bank  (ECB).  The  ECB  orients  monetary  policy  instruments  towards  price  stability,  and  has
defined price stability as an inflation rate below 2 per cent. The rise in prices for imported goods  is
expected  to  continue  to  be  relatively  low,  leaving  room  for  a  somewhat  higher  rise  in  prices  for
domestically  produced  goods  and  services.  Corporate  profits  and  margins  vary  and  influence  price
inflation from one year to the next, but are to some extent self-regulating. High margins tend to result
in  stronger  wage  growth,  while  low  margins  lead  to  tighter  cost  control.  Profits  will  thus  revert  to
previous levels. Over time, productivity growth therefore determines the level of wage growth that is
consistent with stability in prices and the exchange rate. With productivity growth around the average
for the 1980s and 1990s, ie in the order of one and a half per cent per  year, nominal wage growth
should be brought down to between 3 and 4 per cent. There will be room for higher wage growth if
productivity growth increases, as seems to be the case in Sweden and Finland.

In  recent  years,  cost  inflation  in  the  euro  area  countries  and  among  trading  partners  has  been
relatively low. Growth in labour costs in Norway has been roughly 11 percentage points higher than in
the euro area and 10 percentage points higher than among trading partners in the past three years.

Unemployment as a percentage of the labour force

BIS Review14?/2001
A number of other small, open economies have recorded a decline in unemployment and lower growth
in labour costs than Norway. In Sweden, unemployment has shown a substantial decrease over the
past five  years and  wage growth  is below 4 per cent. Three-year  wage  agreements  are  now  being
concluded, underpinning the basis for low cost inflation. In the Netherlands, unemployment has fallen
to  a  very  low  level.  Wage  growth  has  picked  up,  but  is  lower  than  in  Norway.  In  Denmark,
unemployment has come down without an increase in wage  growth. In Finland, unemployment has
fallen sharply from the high level that took hold in the 1990s, and wage growth has slowed. In the euro
area, unemployment has dropped without an increase in wage growth. In Norway, the high growth in
labour costs may be a source of rising unemployment.
In  connection  with  the  wage  settlement  last  year,  short-term  interest  rates  rose  by  1½  percentage
points. The substantial rise in costs in Norway,  which  was reflected  in  the strong  pay  increases for
white-collar employees and  in the  centralised  income  settlement,  contributed  to  pushing  up  interest
rates. In previous periods, higher wage growth has also been accompanied by a rise in interest rates.
In 1998, the negotiated wage increases, in conjunction with the depreciation of the krone exchange
rate, led to a rise in interest rates of 4½ percentage points over the spring and summer months. The
income settlement in 1986, which was negotiated during the strongest boom in the post-war period,
resulted in a severe cost shock for  Norwegian  enterprises  and,  combined  with  the  fall  in  oil  prices,
forced a devaluation of the Norwegian krone. This  was followed by high interest  rates  over  several
years. Falling wage and cost inflation from 1989, however, provided the basis for the decline in interest
rates  from  1992.  The  centralised  income  settlements  are  important  for  wage  and  interest  rate
developments, but they do not take place in a vacuum. The outcome is influenced by labour market
tightness  and  income  developments  for  groups  other  than  those  covered  by  the  centralised
settlements.

Rise in labour costs, 1998-2000
Norwegian key rates are currently 1½ percentage points higher than in the US, 2¼ percentage points
higher  than  in  the  euro  area,  and  3  percentage  points  higher  than  in  Sweden.  In  some  countries,
short-term  interest  rates  are  now  moving  down  and  in  other  countries  expectations  of  interest  rate
increases have receded. Norges Bank has a neutral bias with regard to interest rates developments,
partly reflecting price and cost developments in Norway, as illustrated in the chart.
In general, it can be argued that when wage and cost inflation is expected to rise and deviate from the
rate of increase in the euro area, or when unexpected upwards shifts in labour costs occur, interest
rates must be raised to avoid rising inflation and a weaker krone. In our open economy, with a floating
exchange  rate,  it  can  be  assumed  that  an  increase  in  wage  growth  of  one  percentage  point  will
gradually  translate  into  a  corresponding  increase  in  price  inflation  unless  the  wage  increases  are
anchored in higher productivity. The magnitude  of  the  increase  in  interest  rates  must  be  consistent
with  this.  First,  nominal  interest  rates  must  be  increased  in  order  to  maintain  real  interest  rates.
Second,  real  interest  rates  must  also  be  increased  with  a  view  to  removing  the  causes  behind  the
differentials.

Interaction with fiscal policy
It  is  important  that  the  annual  budgets  are  based  on  a  long-term  strategy  that  takes  into  account
possible fluctuations in oil revenues from one year to the next. With large and, to some extent, varying
budget revenues, the basis for determining central government expenditure and taxes from one year
to the next may easily be impaired. If budget spending is allowed to vary in step with oil prices, the
Norwegian  economy  may  experience  abrupt  shifts  and  instability.  Changes  in  oil  prices  may  then
quickly  influence  wage  and  price  expectations,  the  exchange  rate  and  long-term  rates.  In  addition,
short-term rates would have to be changed frequently and sharply.

In recent years, central government real underlying spending growth has accelerated somewhat. Both
in 2000 and 2001, spending growth has been higher than 2 per cent, which is above potential growth
in  the  mainland  economy.  At  the  same  time,  taxes  have  increased.  Fiscal  policy  has  thus  had  a
virtually neutral effect on domestic demand for two years while wage growth has been substantially
higher than in other countries.
A  possible  interpretation  of  this  development  is  that  it  is  more  demanding  to  use  the  government
budget to dampen cyclical fluctuations during an upturn than during a downturn. The willingness and
ability to pursue a counter-cyclical policy may in itself be cyclical.
Another interpretation is that a neutral fiscal policy in a year featuring a sharp increase in government
financial assets reflects a balance between using the government budget to stabilise the economy and
phasing in higher financial revenues in the economy.
Irrespective, a gradual shift in economic policy is taking place. While fiscal policy is having a neutral
impact on domestic demand, monetary policy is having a contractionary effect. This is partly reflected
in higher short-term rates compared with long-term rates. The focus of the income settlements may
also be said to have changed somewhat since the mid-1990s, with less emphasis on balanced labour
market developments.
Natural resources and growth capacity
Petroleum  revenues  fluctuate  widely,  with  substantial  uncertainty  as  to  future  developments.  This
raises the question of how quickly petroleum revenues shall be used. The term “Dutch disease” was
first used to describe the situation in the Dutch economy in the 1970s and 1980s after revenues from
the large gas finds in the Groningen field were used to finance strong growth in public expenditure.
When the gas revenues declined and growth in the economy came to a halt, a tightening of policy was
necessary and unemployment rose.
The Norwegian economy was also hit by the Dutch disease in the 1980s. The reason was that in the
previous decade the state had budgeted on the basis of future strong growth in petroleum revenues.
Welfare  schemes  were  expanded.  As  in  the  Netherlands,  manufacturing  industry  was  scaled  back.
The recession after the bubble burst in the credit market and oil prices fell in 1986 was much deeper
than would have been the case if we had maintained a larger and competitive manufacturing sector.
6
BIS Review14?/2001
Norwegian  industry  lost  export  market  shares  in  the  late  1980s  in  spite  of  the  booming  conditions
abroad and substantial capacity slack at home. The Dutch  disease,  both  in  the  Netherlands  and  in
Norway,  led  to  higher  unemployment  and  substantial  social  losses.  However,  in  both  countries  the
economy was back on track in the 1990s.
At the same time, the experience of other countries indicates that in the long run the supply of natural
resources can prove to be just as much of a disadvantage as an advantage for a nation’s economy.
Many  countries  with  an  abundance  of  natural  resources  are  poor  today.  They  have  not  used  the
resources to provide for sustainable higher income. Since 1950, developments in many oil-producing
nations have been very unstable, while many Asian and European countries without access to natural
resources are among the world’s richest countries. It would appear that easy money can reduce the
growth capacity  in  an economy. A comparison  of economic developments in  Norway  and  the  other
Nordic countries in recent years may also be a source of concern. Their business sector now seems to
have a stronger growth capacity than our own.
There are three pitfalls that must be avoided.
First,  in  countries  with  substantial  revenues  from  natural  resources,  growth  conditions  for  the
internationally  exposed  sector  may  become  less  favourable.  The  exposure  of  large  parts  of  the
economy  to  intense  foreign  competition  provides  a  breeding  ground  for  learning,  innovation  and
development.  Competitive  pressures  in  sheltered  sectors,  such  as  internal  trade  and  public
enterprises, are normally more limited. In my view, it is essential to maintain a broad exposed sector in
the mainland economy, primarily because of the effect this has on the growth capacity of the economy.
Second, substantial petroleum wealth can weaken financial discipline in enterprises that are financed
or  assume  that  they  can  be  financed  by  the  public  sector.  If  enterprises  assume  that  the  central
government will provide support, resources may be squandered and the risk of substantial losses may
be  given  little  emphasis.  The  organisation  of  public  enterprises  is  thus  important.  The  central
government’s  financial  responsibility  for  individual  enterprises  and  for  other  levels  of  public
administration must be delimited in a credible manner.
Third,  petroleum  production  generates  a  profit  in  excess  of  a  normal  return,  ie  economic  rent.  As
economic rent accrues to the state, the central government is now accumulating substantial capital. A
strong interest in gaining access to this capital can easily arise. There is a risk that entrepreneurship,
talent and energy in the business sector and political life are used to acquire a piece of the economic
rent  –  to  dance  around  the  golden  calf  –  rather  than  for  innovation,  restructuring  and  growth.
Decision-making forms in economic and political life must provide an effective shield to prevent special
interests from gaining a dominant influence and control over petroleum wealth. The risk is particularly
high in cases where markets are not efficient and where the remuneration for an assignment or the
price  of  the  resource  that  is  transferred  from  the  state  are  agreed  through  negotiations.  The  EEA
Agreement restricts the scope for favouring individual enterprises or groups of enterprises. The eager
control  exercised  by  the  surveillance  body,  the  ESA,  reduces  the  possibility  for  pressure  groups  to
prevail. It is important for growth capacity that both national and international competition authorities
engage  in  effective  supervision  in  order  to  avoid  the  development  of  a  business  sector  that  is
dependent on protection.
Against this background, I would like to expand on the central government’s asset position and wealth
management.

The  table  shows  in  simplified  form  the  central  government’s  financial  assets  and  liabilities,  with
estimates  for  the  balance  at  the  end  of  2000.  The  government’s  most  important  assets  are  the
Government Petroleum Fund, assets in the National Insurance Fund, and the state’s direct ownership
interests  in  enterprises.  The  estimate  for  the  government’s  direct  ownership  in  the  table  includes
Statoil, Norsk Hydro, Telenor, Statkraft and DnB. In addition, the state has many smaller stakes and
direct loans through the state banks. The government has loan debt. In the table, the figures for the
National Insurance Fund  are consolidated as  the  Fund’s  claims  on  the  central  government  and  the
central government’s debt to the Fund are offset. The table shows that the central government’s loans
through  the  state  banks  are  approximately  the  same  as  the  central  government’s  loan  debt.  The
central government raises loans in the bond market and lends through the state banks. The interest
rate on the loans and the pricing of risk are market-related. If we exclude this credit intermediation, the
management of government wealth is primarily linked to state ownership interests in the Norwegian
business sector, the National Insurance Fund and the Government Petroleum Fund.

In  the  years  ahead,  the  capital  in  the  Petroleum  Fund  will  increase  as  the  surplus  on  the  central
government  budget  is  transferred  to  the  Fund.  The  chart  shows  the  estimates  for  growth  in  the
Petroleum Fund. The projections, as they should be, are based on prudent assumptions concerning oil
and gas prices, the return on the Fund and the domestic use of oil revenues.
The state’s direct financial interest in petroleum activities (SDFI) may be regarded as part of the tax
system.  The  government  would  have  had  little  possibility  of  ensuring  that  a  sizeable  share  of  the
8
BIS Review14?/2001
economic  rent  benefit  society  without  such  a  field-specific  instrument.  It  is  doubtful  whether  the
government can fully realise the value of the SDFI through its disposal.
Buyers  may  have  more  knowledge  about  the  holdings  than  the  seller.  Companies  that  buy  SDFI
stakes will also face some uncertainty as to the future tax system, which will have a negative effect on
their willingness to pay. It is therefore understandable that only a smaller share of the SDFI is offered
for  sale.  At  the  same  time,  the  sale  of  the  SDFI  increases  the  need  to  remedy  the  substantial
loopholes that have been found in the petroleum tax system.

The previous table showing government assets and liabilities does not, however, provide a complete
picture  of  the  government’s  financial  position.  The  right  to  tax  corporate  and  personal  income  and
wealth  and  to  levy  indirect  taxes  is  clearly  the  government’s  most  important  asset.  General
government tax revenues are estimated at close to NOK630 billion this year. The expected real return
on  government  net  financial  wealth  is  about  a  sixteenth  of  this.  In  2005,  when  the  value  of  the
Government Petroleum Fund could reach NOK1200 billion,  the  total return  on  government  financial
assets will approach one tenth of general government revenues at the current tax level.
At  the  same  time,  future  expenditure  on  pensions,  health,  education,  infrastructure  and  the  judicial
system represents a major commitment for the government.
Government expenditure for maintaining and developing the welfare state will increase substantially in
the  years  ahead,  primarily  as  a  result  of  demographic  trends.  Estimates  show  that  government
expenditure on old-age pensions and disability benefits will double from 7½ per cent of GDP in 2001
to 15 per cent of GDP in 30 years. At the same time, it is reasonable to assume that spending on other
programmes,  which  are  today  financed  over  government  budgets,  will  increase  as  a  share  of  total
GDP.
With the  current  tax  level,  in  conjunction  with  the  challenges  that  increased  trade  and  globalisation
pose  to  the  tax  system,  there  would  hardly  be  scope  for  increasing  taxes.  It  would  therefore  be
reasonable to assert that the value of the right to tax is lower than the value of commitments taken on
by the government when the intention is to develop the welfare state. Without substantial government
saving in the years ahead, promises to preserve the welfare state will lose credibility. The government
thus  has  a  clear  motive  for  saving.  At  the  same  time,  the  high  level  of  petroleum  revenues,  as
mentioned, provides scope for accumulating substantial government financial wealth.
In my view, three points are of importance with regard to government wealth management.
First, investment must be based on the reason underlying government saving which, as I understand
it,  is  to  distribute  petroleum  wealth  across  generations  and  establish  a  foundation  for  maintaining
important elements of the welfare state.
Second,  the  manager  must  seek  to  achieve  a  maximum  return  within  duly  considered  risk  limits.
Returns  and  risk  must  be  monitored  continuously.  The  return  and  the  risk  limit  must  reflect  the
government’s motive for saving.
BIS Review 14/2001

Third, the management must be organised so that the manager pursues the objectives of the owner
and does not develop its own goals.
The government’s motive for saving resembles the motives underlying saving in pension funds and life
insurance  companies.  Among  the  government’s  saving  vehicles,  investments  in  the  National
Insurance Fund and the Government Petroleum Fund are best adapted to this motive for saving.
For both funds, there is a clear division of responsibility between the manager and the government,
with the Ministry of Finance as owner. In the case of the Petroleum Fund, Norges Bank’s mandate is
to achieve the highest possible financial return in keeping with the strategy and risk limits established
by the government.
The Fund’s investments are distributed among many countries and spread among a large number of
equities and bonds. At end-2000, the Fund had invested NOK 153 billion in about 1800 companies in
21 countries, while NOK 234 billion had been invested in bonds in 18 countries. All ownership interests
are now less than 1 per cent of the companies’ total value. A turnaround in one country or a region,
which in isolation may be pronounced, will not have a major effect on the total value of the Fund. The
value of the Fund’s equity portfolio will therefore shadow developments in prices on international stock
exchanges. There is a substantial element of risk diversification, although we are not immune to the
risk associated with the uncertainty in global developments. Along the same lines, the return on bond
investments will reflect international interest rate developments.
The Government Petroleum Fund is built up through transfers of petroleum revenues that are not used
domestically. In other words, the value of a natural resource is converted into a financial asset. The
name of the Fund was chosen to reflect this. However, one weakness that may be associated with the
Petroleum  Fund  is  that  the  objective  of  saving  is  not  sufficiently  highlighted.  The  future  use  of
revenues could have been made clearer either by choosing another name or by earmarking the capital
for  specific  future  uses,  even  though  this  would  imply  a  constraint  on  the  government’s  scope  for
manoeuvre.  The  study  that  is  being  planned  may  analyse  fundamental  and  practical  aspects  of
establishing  a  link  between  the  pension  system  in  Norway  and  the  assets  in  the  Government
Petroleum Fund.
The National Insurance Fund’s investments are mainly confined to Norway. As a result, changes in the
value of the Fund’s equity portfolio primarily reflect developments in Norwegian business and industry.
The Fund has larger ownership interests in individual companies than the Petroleum Fund, and wider
fluctuations in value.

This  is  illustrated  further  in  the  chart.  The  composition  of  government  assets  is  broken  down  into
equities  and  bonds  in  the  Petroleum  Fund  and  the  National  Insurance  Fund  and  government
ownership interests in the five largest companies. The horizontal axis provides a normal measure of
risk,  in  other  words  the  standard  deviation  of  the  return.  The  risk  is  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the
historical performance of the companies’ share prices. For unlisted companies, we have used share
price  performance  for  comparable  international  companies.  Higher  risk  means  that  the  assets  are
more exposed to fluctuations in return. As a whole, the return on the Petroleum Fund and the return on
private bond holdings in the National Insurance Fund feature a moderate risk profile. The risk is higher
for both the National Insurance Fund’s equities and the state’s ownership interests in the five largest
companies.
For a given expected return, the owner should aim at reducing risk because future income will then be
more secure. Conversely, the owner should require a higher return on investments with higher risk.
The absence of this excess return will reflect social losses.
It is important to bear in mind that the government can choose the composition, the required return
and  the  risk  profile  with  regard  to  its  financial  investments  without  taking  into  account  the  funding
requirements of Norwegian companies. By the same token, Norwegian companies can choose their
debt and equity structure independent of the government’s financial investments. The capital market
serves as an intermediary between the government as investor and enterprises seeking capital. This
market  makes  it  possible  to  separate  the  government’s  choices  from  companies’  choices.  The
distribution  of  the  government’s  financial  investments  and  the  choice  of  corporate  funding  structure
should  not  be  based  on  the  notion  that  we  are  living  in  a  barter  economy.  The  Norwegian  capital
market is part of a Nordic market, which is being increasingly integrated into an international capital
market. Capital markets are a very efficient tool for channelling funds from savers to investors.
Direct strategic ownership could nevertheless be the best solution if it generates a high return and the
government  has  a  solid  basis  for  exercising  its  role  as  owner.  There  is  some  room  for  doubt
concerning both points. The government has often neglected its demanding role as owner. A number
of shortcomings stand out with regard to the way government ownership is managed.
First,  the  government  has  shown  little  ability  and  willingness  to  impose  clear  and  ambitious  return
requirements and control the financial risk in companies where it has a dominant stake. In addition, if
the companies are underperforming, both jobs and regions will be adversely affected.
Second, the government has not developed effective management of equity in the companies.  The
size  of  equity  and  the  dividend  policy  seem  to  be  randomly  determined  by  historical  factors.  New
equity management instruments, such as share  buy-backs and extraordinary dividends,  are seldom
used.  On  the  whole,  it  seems  difficult  for  a  state-owned  enterprise  and  for  the  state  as  owner  to
acknowledge that a growth period may have come to an end and that the owners should invest their
capital elsewhere.
Third,  the  state  as  owner  will  always  have  a  strong  aversion  to  negative  corporate  events.  On  the
other hand, the state will provide little extra rewards to a company that has boosted its return on equity
by one or two percentage points. The result is an erosion of an important driving force behind growth.

In a state-owned enterprise the board or management of the company and the state as owner may
have a common interest in overcapitalising the company because they will then both be on the safe
side.
Fourth,  the  state  has  complex  and  elaborate  procedures  for  making  decisions.  Moreover,  the
procedures are designed to accommodate tasks other than the role of ownership. Studies in political
science show that the weighing of interests occurs through deliberations in ministries or parliamentary
standing committees. As a result, decision-making procedures may not be suitable for the owner to
provide clear management signals and ensure consistency over time.
Fifth,  it  is  difficult  for  the  government  to  maintain  clear  dividing  lines  between  its  various  roles.
Considerations  regarding  business  policy,  state  finances  and  demand  management  can  impair
ownership management and make it a disadvantage for an enterprise to be owned by the state.
Historical factors tend to explain each of the government’s current strategic ownership interests. Some
state enterprises have changed from a state monopoly with administrative functions to companies that
now compete in a market. Ownership, for example in the electricity sector, may in other cases have
been a historical instrument for providing the government with economic rent.
Several of the former state-owned enterprises have been partly privatised, which could contribute to
improving the management of companies by  its owners. Company  performance  will receive greater
attention,  for  example.  This  would  enhance  the  management  of  equity  capital  and  create  greater
impatience  with  regard  to  performance.  This  would  stimulate  growth.  The  sale  of  state  ownership
interests will also enhance the efficiency of the domestic capital market, which now primarily features a
shortage of investment vehicles rather than a shortage of capital.
At the same time, it is important for the state to assume the ownership responsibility associated with
its  remaining  ownership  interests.  As  a  large  owner,  the  state  will  have  to  safeguard  its  financial
interests ensuing from its current holdings. This is partly because various owners may have different
interests to promote. Joint ownership is not the same as joint interests.
The reason for government ownership that seems to have been highlighted most is the importance of
national ownership. There may be concern that the acquisition of Norwegian companies could lead to
a  relocation  of  head  offices,  research  and  product  development  to  a  foreign  country.  Proximity
between  decision-makers  and  enterprises  may  also  be  important.  On  the  other  hand,  it  may  be  a
disadvantage for an enterprise to be designated as a means of safeguarding national ownership. The
state  may  after  a  period  find  that  it  owns  enterprises  that  were,  but  no  longer  are  important.  The
business sector is not static.
At the same time, cross-border acquisitions and sales of companies are important for disseminating
knowledge and technology and thus for enhancing growth. Value added in Norwegian companies can
be increased when they acquire foreign companies, and in many cases Norwegian jobs may be more
secure  under  the  ownership  of  a  company  located  abroad.  The  best  contribution  to  balanced
ownership  is  a  well  functioning  Norwegian  capital  market,  a  solid  infrastructure  in  infrastructure,  a
neutral tax treatment of investment and a well educated workforce. Changes in state ownership of two
of  the  three  largest  Norwegian  commercial  banks  illustrate  that  national  considerations,  although
deemed important, are not always decisive.

BIS Review14?/2001
Allow me to conclude by summing up my discussion of government wealth management as follows:
• 
The government has a clear motive to save, which is to distribute petroleum wealth across
generations and foster  confidence  in  the  welfare  state.  These  considerations  may  imply  a
considerable accumulation of capital in the hands of the government.
Wealth  management  must  be  adapted  to  the  government’s  motive  to  save.  The  models
chosen for the National Insurance Fund and the Government Petroleum Fund satisfy this.
The  government’s  choice  of  investment  strategy  and  Norwegian  companies’  choice  of
funding structure should be looked upon as two separate things. The capital market is the
most effective tool for channelling funds from saver to investors.
Divestment  of  government  ownership  interests  in  the  Norwegian  business  sector  will
contribute to enhancing ownership management and will stimulate growth.
   Thank you for your attention.
