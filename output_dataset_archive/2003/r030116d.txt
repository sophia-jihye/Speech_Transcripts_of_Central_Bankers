 Rakesh Mohan: Transforming Indian banking - in search of a better tomorrow 
Valedictory address delivered by Dr Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at 
the Bank Economists’ Conference 2002, Bangalore, 29 December 2002. 
 The significant transformation of the banking industry in India is clearly evident from the changes that 
have occurred in the financial markets, institutions and products. While deregulation has opened up 
new  vistas  for  banks  to  augment  revenues,  it  has  entailed  greater  competition  and  consequently 
greater risks. Cross-border flows and entry of new products, particularly derivative instruments, have 
impacted significantly on the domestic banking sector, forcing banks to adjust the product mix, as also 
to  effect  rapid  changes  in  their  processes  and  operations  in  order  to  remain  competitive  to  the 
globalised environment. These developments have facilitated greater choice for consumers, who have 
become  more  discerning  and  demanding  compelling  banks  to  offer  a  broader  range  of  products 
through diverse distribution channels. The traditional face of banks as mere financial  intermediaries 
has since altered and risk management has emerged as their defining attribute. 
- Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2001-02, Reserve Bank of India 
Mr. Verghese, ladies and gentlemen, 
It  gives  me  great  pleasure  to  deliver  the  valedictory  address  at  the  Bank  Eonomists’  Conference 
(BECON)  2002.  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Corporation  Bank  and  the  Indian  Banks’  Association  for 
giving  me  this  opportunity.  Over  the  years,  the  BECON  has  evolved  as  an  important  forum  for 
intensive discussions on both contemporary and futuristic issues facing the Indian banking industry.  
This  forum  has  served  as  an  important  platform  for  structured  information-sharing  among  bankers, 
research analysts, credit rating agencies and other financial sector bodies.  
Currently,  the most important factor shaping the  world is globalisation. The benefits of globalisation 
have been well documented and are being increasingly recognised. Integration of domestic markets 
with  international  financial  markets  has  been  facilitated  by  tremendous  advancement  in  information 
and  communications  technology.  But,  such  an  environment  has  also  meant  that  a  problem  in  one 
country  can  sometimes  adversely  impact  one  or  more  countries  instantaneously,  even  if  they  are 
fundamentally strong.   
There is a growing realisation that the ability of countries to conduct business across national borders 
and the ability to cope with the possible downside risks would depend, inter alia, on the soundness of 
the  financial  system.  This  has  consequently  meant  the  adoption  of  a  strong  and  transparent, 
prudential, regulatory, supervisory, technological and institutional framework in the financial sector on 
par  with  international  best  practices.  All  this  necessitates  a  transformation:  a  transformation  in  the 
mindset,  a  transformation  in  the  business  processes  and  finally,  a  transformation  in  knowledge 
management. This process is not a one shot affair; it needs to be appropriately phased in the least 
disruptive  manner.  The  subject  of  the  Conference  is,  therefore,  very  timely  and  appropriate  and  I 
would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the organizers for this theme. 
As you would all appreciate, the banking and financial crises in recent years in emerging economies 
have demonstrated that, when things go wrong with the financial system, they can result in a severe 
economic downturn. Furthermore, banking crises often impose substantial costs on the exchequer, the 
incidence  of  which  is  ultimately  borne  by  the  taxpayer.  The World  Bank  Annual  Report  (2002)  has 
observed that the loss of US $1 trillion in banking crises in the 1980s and 1990s is equal to the total 
flow of official development assistance to developing countries from 1950s to the present date. As a 
consequence, the focus of financial market reform in many  emerging economies has been towards 
increasing efficiency while at the same time ensuring stability in financial markets.  
From  this  perspective,  financial  sector  reforms  are  essential  in  order  to  avoid  such  costs.  It  is, 
therefore, not surprising that financial market reform is at the forefront of public policy debate in recent 
years. The burgeoning literature on endogenous growth theory has come to recognize the crucial role 
of sound financial markets in promoting rapid economic growth and ensuring financial stability. Indeed, 
it  is  by  now  widely  documented  that  the  structure  of  financial  markets  helps  explain  why  some 
countries remain poor, while others grow richer. Financial sector reform, through the development of

 an efficient financial system, is thus perceived as a key element in raising countries out of their ‘low 
level equilibrium trap’. As the World Bank Annual Report (2002) observes, ‘a robust financial system is 
a precondition for a sound investment climate, growth and the reduction of poverty’.  
Financial sector reforms were initiated in India a decade ago with a view to improving efficiency in the 
process of financial intermediation, enhancing the effectiveness in the conduct of monetary policy and 
creating  conditions  for  integration  of  the  domestic  financial  sector  with  the  global  system.  The  first 
phase  of  reforms  was  guided  by  the  recommendations  of  Narasimham  Committee  I.  The  approach 
was to ensure that ‘the financial services industry operates on the basis of operational flexibility and 
functional  autonomy  with  a  view  to  enhancing  efficiency,  productivity  and  profitability’.  The  second 
phase, guided by Narasimham Committee II, focused on strengthening the foundations of the banking 
system and bringing about structural improvements. While there may be some concern over the pace 
and sequencing of reforms in the financial sector vis-à-vis the real sector, you will agree with me when 
I say that we have traversed a considerable distance since 1991. Reforms in the financial sector and 
their beneficial impact have been well documented and I will not attempt to repeat them here. The text 
of  the  Governor’s  inaugural  address  also  covers  at  length  important  issues  such  as  ownership, 
corporate governance, regulatory and supervisory issues and the like. I also see from the schedule 
that you have held intensive discussions on important issues related to corporate governance, reform 
of the capital structure, (in the context of Basel II norms), retail banking, risk management technology, 
and human resources development, among others.  
I  would,  therefore,  like  to  sensitize  this  forum,  where  the  intellectual  elite  of  the  banking  industry  is 
present, with certain important policy issues confronting the financial sector at the present juncture. I 
believe they are critical in my opinion because they have important ramifications for economic growth 
and  for  sustained  profitability  of  the  banking  industry.  These  issues  are  at  the  forefront  of  policy 
discussions on Indian banking and would need to be pro-actively addressed, now. 
Interest Rate Scenario 
The first important issue that I would like to highlight relates to interest rates.  
As a result of interest rate deregulation, the interest rate structure of banks is competitively determined 
in the market, barring a few exceptions. A major factor that has influenced the trend in interest rates is 
the  sustained  decline  in  the  inflation  rate  in  the  recent  period.  Notwithstanding  year-to-year 
fluctuations, there has been a distinct downward drift in the inflation rate during the second half of the 
1990s,  which is now at around half the level as compared  with the first half of the 1990s. Both the 
popular measures of inflation - the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
–  have  shown  a  definite  fall  in  the  recent  period.  For  example,  the  WPI  on  an  average  basis  has 
declined from an average of about 10.5 per cent per annum between 1990-91  to 1995-96 to about 
5 per  cent  per  annum  over  the  last  5  years.  A  similar  trend  can  be  observed  with  regard  to  the 
Consumer  Price  Index  for  industrial  workers.  In  the  current  year  so  far,  inflation  as  measured  by 
variations in WPI, has remained benign around 3 per cent despite the adverse effect of drought and 
uncertainty on account of oil prices. As the inflation rate has decelerated, it has also had a positive 
impact on inflationary expectations. This is clearly reflected in the downward trend in nominal interest 
rates. 
For instance, the overnight call money rate has fallen sharply from about 13 per cent in August 2000 to 
the current levels of 5.5 per cent. Similarly, the 91-day Treasury Bill rate declined from 10.5 per cent to 
5.4  per  cent  and  the  364-day  Treasury  Bill  rate  from  10.9  per  cent  to  5.6  per  cent  over  the  same 
period. 
The  long-term  interest  rates  too  have  declined.  The  yield  on  10-Year  government  securities  has 
declined  from  11.5  per  cent  in  August  2000  to  the  current  levels  of  about  6.3  per  cent.  Similarly, 
interest  rates  on  corporate  paper  have  fallen  significantly.  For  example,  the  interest  rate  on  5-Year 
AAA  rated  corporate  paper  has  declined  from  12  per  cent  in  August  2000  to  about  6.7  per  cent 
currently.  
The banks have also reduced their deposit rates. The term deposit rates of public sector banks over 
one year maturity have declined from a range of 8-10 per cent in August 2000 to 6-8 per cent now. 
This fall in the interest rates in the recent period has been in consonance  with the monetary policy 
stance of a soft and a flexible interest rate regime. Despite the fall in deposit rates, depositors have 
received positive real interest rates of close to 2 per cent in the second half of the 1990s, which is 
much higher than the real return on deposits during the first half of the 1990s.

 BIS Review 1/2003
 On the other hand, lending rates of banks have not come down as much. While banks have reduced 
their  prime  lending  rates  (PLRs)  to  some  extent  and  are  also  extending  sub-PLR  loans,  effective 
lending rates continue to remain high (Table 1 and Graph 1). It is estimated that the average lending 
rate  of  scheduled  commercial  banks  has  declined  from  a  peak  of  about  17  per  cent  in  1995-96  to 
about 14 per cent by 2001-02. Hence, while nominal interest rates have come down, they have not 
fallen as much as the inflation rate. Consequently, the effective real lending rate continues to remain 
high.  This  development  has  adverse  systemic  implications,  especially  in  a  country  like  India  where 
interest cost as a proportion of sales of corporates are much higher as compared to many emerging 
economies.

A  cross  country1  comparison  of  interest  rate  trends  during  the  1990s  provides  some  interesting 
insights (Table 2). The average inflation rate in all these countries has come down during the second 
half  of  that  decade  (1997-2001)  as  compared  to  the  first  half.  In  line  with  this,  the  average  money 
market  interest  rates  and  government  securities  yields  have  also  come  down  in  real  terms  in  most 
countries. On the lending side, however, prime rates in some countries have not shown similar falls in 
real interest rates (UK, Germany, Japan, Thailand and Hungary). Thus, the Indian experience of sticky 
real  lending  rates  is  not  unique.  But,  preliminary  estimates  do  show  a  high  correlation  between 
government securities yields and real lending rate in Japan, India and Germany during the 1990s as a 
whole.  Hence,  the  downward  rigidity  in  lending  rates  in  India  as  compared  with  the  government 
securities rates during the second half of the 1990s does seem more surprising in this context. It would 
seem  that  changes  in  inflationary  expectations  take  a  little  longer  to  adjust  than  inflation  rates 
themselves.  It  would  be  rational  for  interest  rates  to  be  related  to  inflationary  expectations,  and  in 
particular long-term interest rates. Therefore, bank economists have an important role of informing the 
management  of  appropriate  inflationary  expectations  so  that  interest  rates  can  be  adjusted  more 
systematically.

Understandably, there are  certain rigidities in the  overall interest rate structure in the economy that 
constrain banks from reducing their lending rates. These have  been  well documented in the earlier 
monetary and credit policy statements of the RBI. Subsequently, interest rates on small savings have 
also  moved  down  and  there  is  a  commitment  from  the  Government  to  link  these  rates  with  market 
related rates. The recovery environment has also improved. A related issue pertains to transparency in 
lending rates. Especially after the introduction of sub-PLR lending by banks, the spreads between the 
BIS Review 1/2003 
 5
 minimum and maximum lending rates seem to have widened. The RBI is making efforts to publish on 
its  website  bank-wise  information  on  the  minimum  and  maximum  lending  rates.  Our  own  internal 
exercises reveal that the concept of PLR may need to be reviewed in the current context. Perhaps, 
bank economists may like to study the international experience and come out with suggestions.  
Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises 
The  problem  arising  out  of  high  lending  rates  gets  accentuated  due  to  segmentation  in  the  credit 
market. The large corporates are able to negotiate fine rates with banks and are able to bring down 
their  overall  interest  costs.  In  addition,  the  large  corporates  have  the  option  of  accessing  the 
international capital markets for funds. The burden of adjustment has, therefore, fallen on small and 
medium enterprises (SMEs), which have limited access to funds. The high interest rates paid by SMEs 
may not always be in accordance with their risk profile.  
It  is  clear  that  at  present  the  Indian  banking  system  is  not  fully  equipped  to  promote  small-scale 
enterprises around the country. The key issue is that banking institutions must be enabled to improve 
their credit assessment capabilities with regard to small-scale enterprises so that they can distinguish 
adequately  between  good  and  bad  credit.  Small-scale  must  not  be  equated  with  high  risk.  If  the 
inflation rate is as low as 3 per cent and the interest rates charged to SMEs are much higher than 
normal  good  credit  risk  to  large-sized  industries,  there  is  an  implicit  adverse  selection  in  the  credit 
appraisal process. Bank economists need to give focused attention to risk assessment to this sector 
so that there are no errors of high interest rate to low risk borrowers in the SME sector and vice-versa. 
The  provision  for  Credit  Information  Bureaus  and  better  exchange  of  information  on  credit  risk 
between  banks  and  financial  institutions  is  also  necessary  to  enable  these  institutions  to  recognise 
higher risk without excessive costs. Furthermore, the cost of credit assessment of small and medium 
enterprises can be reduced by a focused recognition of clusters of like small-scale industries that exist 
around  the  country.  Such  financial  assistance  programmes  also  need  to  be  devised  to  provide 
assistance  to  those  industries  that  are  in  the  reserved  list  to  enable  them  to  expand  and  upgrade 
technology.  This  should  be  done  both  at  the  individual  and  group  level.  The  focus  of  many  such 
activities can be on the basis of industrial clusters so that economies of scale can be achieved both in 
financial assistance and in technology upgradation.  
Very significant changes are also taking place in the agricultural sector. We can see the beginning of a 
much  closer  connection  between  primary  producers,  trade  intermediaries,  food  processing  entities, 
and eventual marketing of value added products. With the share of unprocessed foods falling, the real 
growth  area  in  the  agricultural  sector  is  in  value  added  food  products  such  as  meat,  poultry,  fish 
vegetables, fruits and the like. There is an accelerating move of consumers to basic processed foods. 
These trends need to be studied carefully so that supporting policy changes and investments can be 
made. Banks should explore the feasibility of expanding substantially lending to these activities. 
Apart from adequate quantum of credit at an affordable price, there are issues relating to provision of 
high processing costs and the attendant cumbersome paper work. There are lessons to be learnt from 
the  experience  of  the  Kisan  Credit  Card  (KCC)  Schemes  and  the  Laghu  Udhyami  Credit  Card 
Schemes  to  the  agricultural  and  small  entrepreneur  borrowers.  Surely,  there  is  some  scope  for 
extending  the  benefits  of  hassle  free  credit  facilities  through  similar  innovative  methods  to  other 
borrowers requiring credit limits of over Rs. 2 lakh also. It needs to be recognised that the SME sector 
has  tremendous  growth  potential  and  accordingly  pricing  of  loans  to  this  sector  should  be  at 
commensurate rates. Thus, there is need for realignment of interest rates among various segments of 
the financial market. As the financial market develops, ideally the interest rates on all types of debt 
instruments, both  in the government  and private sectors, and  in  the credit market should align  in a 
relatively narrow band, reflecting realistic risk premia. 
There have been some signals of industrial pick up during the last few months. For the four months 
from July to October 2002, on a point to point basis, the rise in index of industrial production (IIP) has 
been  above  6  per  cent.  A  major  contribution  to  the  high  growth  rates  has  been  the  manufacturing 
sector.  In  use-based  classification  also,  the  capital  goods  sector  has  registered  impressive  growth 
rates of over 15 per cent and 12 per cent in September and October 2002 respectively. Most (14 out of 
17) industry groups in the index have shown positive growth rates. The increase in non-food credit of 
scheduled commercial banks during the current financial year also appears to be commensurate with 
the IIP performance.

 BIS Review 1/2003
 Nevertheless,  banks  have  shown  a  marked  preference  for  investments  in  government  securities 
instead of pursuing their core activity of lending to commercial sector.  At an aggregate level, the SLR 
holdings of banks are close to 39 per cent as compared to the regulatory prescription of 25 per cent. 
Even strong commercial banks seem to be voluntarily adopting ‘narrow banking’ in a bid to minimize 
credit risk while increasing profitability. Such large investments in government securities well beyond 
the  statutory  requirement  reflect  dissipation  of  banking  knowledge  capital  with  regard  to  credit 
appraisals. The interest rate risk on investments in gilts need hardly be over emphasised. Further, the 
current focus of banks is bound to exact some heavy costs in terms of efficiency and credit availability. 
There is a danger of the link between liquidity, credit, money and economic activity being severed in 
the long run as a result of continued over-investment in government securities as a substitute for bank 
financing to the commercial sector. 
At  a  time  when  the  industry  is  showing  signs  of  pick  up,  banks  should  make  efforts  to  increase 
commercial lending. The need of the hour is revival of the manufacturing sector and financing of the 
new  slew  of  activities  allied  to  agricultural  lending.  Of  course,  this  would  require  focused  attention 
through  specialised  branches,  sound  credit  appraisals,  adoption  of  sophisticated  risk  management 
techniques, and better information sharing. The legal environment has also improved with the passing 
of  the  new  act  to  regulate  securitization  and  reconstruction  of  financial  assets  and  enforcement  of 
security interest. 
Revival of Long-Term Financing 
The  development  finance  institutions  (DFIs)  were  set  up  in  the  1950s  to  provide  medium  and 
long-term finance to the private sector. Many of these institutions were sponsored by the Government. 
DFIs  were  expected  to  resolve  long-term  credit  shortages  and  to  acquire  and  disseminate  skills 
necessary  to  assess  projects  and  banks  creditworthiness.  DFIs  were  traditionally  dependent  on 
concessional  sources  of  financing,  guaranteed  by  Government.  On  the  asset  side,  they  were 
predominantly engaged in term lending with banks financing working capital requirements. The post-
reform period has altered the domain of the operations of DFIs both on the liabilities and assets sides. 
While DFIs started competing for funds at market rates of interest, their asset profile also shortened. 
On  the  other  hand,  banks  have  entered  the  domain  of  term  lending.  The  current  trend  is  of  DFIs 
converting  themselves  into  banks.  In  this  context,  the  future  of  long-term  lending  acquires  great 
importance.  
Finance  theory  suggests  that  banks can  play  an  important  role  in  corporate  financing,  especially  in 
situations  of  asymmetric  information,  principal-agent  problems,  design  of  incentive  compatible 
contracts and corporate governance issues. In their early stages of development, corporates are likely 
to  rely  on  bank  finance  for  working  capital  requirements.  Bank  financing  is  also  likely  to  be 
predominant  in  an  economy  having  a  less-sophisticated  legal  framework.  Considerations  of  lower 
transaction costs, efficient risk diversification, cost effective assessment, monitoring and renegotiation 
etc., is likely to make firms more reliant on bank finance than on market based debt instruments.  
International  evidence  on  industrialized  countries  indicates  that  since  the  early  1970s,  banks  have 
played  an  important  role  in  corporate  financing.  The  benefits  of  a  bank-based  financial  system 
vis-à-vis a market-based system were clearly noticeable particularly in the case of Japan, France and 
Italy. During this period, bank financing was equally important in other industrialised and developing 
countries, although equity finance has gained momentum in recent years.  
This is a challenging area as financing of long-term projects involves commitment of large funds over 
long periods with the concomitant asset liability mismatches. The shift from a fixed to a floating interest 
rate regime, development of corporate debt market, introduction of derivatives instruments and further 
enabling changes in the regulatory and legal environment are likely to increase long-term financing by 
banks. Banks would need to think in terms of setting up special wings for term lending, development of 
consortia  and  syndication,  and  cooperation  in  assessment  of  projects.  These  are  areas  for  further 
exploration by bank economists.   
Non-Performing Assets 
One  of  the  main  constraints  to  the  above  issues  that  I  have  raised  is  the  level  of  non-performing 
assets. As of March 31, 2002, the gross NPAs of scheduled commercial banks stood at  Rs.71,000 
crore, of which the NPAs of public sector banks constituted Rs.57,000 crore. The absolute amount of

 NPAs continues to be a major drag on the performance of banks. The large volume of NPAs reflects 
both  an  overhang  of  past  dues  and  on-going  problem  of  fresh  accretion.  As  we  move  towards  the 
international norm of 90 days for recognition of loan impairment, there may be a temporary increase in 
crystalisation of NPAs in the banking sector. There is, therefore, a need to bring about improvements 
in credit administration and management of credit risk. In this context, the Credit Information Bureau 
(CIB)  should  help  in  improving  credit  decisions  by  providing  institutional  mechanism  for  sharing  of 
credit information on borrowers and potential borrowers among banks and financial institutions. The 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) modified the guidelines for compromise settlements of NPAs of the small 
sector  to  provide  a  simplified,  non-discretionary  and  non-discriminatory  mechanism.  Banks  should 
work  out  processes  for  settlement  procedures  and  expedite  quick  recovery  of  NPAs.  The 
Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 
should help in cleansing the balance sheet of banks by facilitating foreclosure. The constitution of an 
Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC) is another channel to remove NPAs from the balance sheets of 
banks through the processes of securitisation of assets. The RBI has recently posted on its website 
the  draft  of  the  directions  on  prudential  norms  proposed  to  be  issued  by  it  to  securitisation 
companies/reconstruction companies. I hope despite the Christmas spirit and the Conference mood, 
experts would have studied the RBI proposals and sent their comments. 
Risk Management 
In the current interest rate environment, banks are finding it more profitable to invest in Government 
Securities. In 2001-02, trading profits of public sector banks more than doubled to Rs.5,999 crore from 
Rs.2,250 crore in 2000-01. The net profits of these banks during these two years were Rs.4,317 crore 
and  Rs.8,301  crore  respectively  and  this  includes  an  additional  Rs.1,365  crore  and  Rs.1,547  crore 
from forex operations. The RBI has been encouraging banks to be proactive in risk management. In 
this context, with a view to building up adequate reserves to guard against any possible reversal of 
interest rate environment in future, banks have been directed to maintain a certain level of Investment 
Fluctuation Reserve (IFR). The Reserve Bank is also taking a number of steps to develop further the 
derivatives market. As announced in the Mid-term review of monetary policy for 2002-03, a Working 
Group  has  been  set  up  with  representatives  from  the  market  to  enlarge  the  avenues  of  managing 
interest  rate  risks  for  banks  and  other  financial  intermediaries  as  well  as  corporates  in  the  rupee 
derivatives market. 
Recently, the Reserve Bank has issued a guidance note on market risk management. The guidance 
note delineates the minimum requirements for a bank including approval levels and requirements for 
any  exceptions,  deviations  or  waivers.  The  note  illustratively  covers  the  responsibilities  of  risk 
management  with  regard  to  market  risk  management,  the  responsibilities  of  risk  taking  unit,  the 
responsibilities of market risk manager, risk identification, risk monitoring, funding and liquidity, models 
of risk analysis, and risk reporting.  
In  a  rapidly  changing  business  environment,  no  business  can  afford  to  remain  static.  It  is  well 
understood that risk-taking is an integral part of any business enterprise. It is important is that each 
bank needs to have in place the technical systems and management processes necessary to not only 
identify  the  risks  associated  with  its  activities,  but  also  to  effectively  measure,  monitor  and  control 
them. If Indian banks are to compete globally, the time is opportune for them to institute sound and 
robust risk management practices.  
Conclusion  
I have today highlighted the need to work towards reducing the real lending rates of banks. This would 
require concerted efforts on the part of the Government and the RBI in respect of removing certain 
structural rigidities and by banks themselves through improving efficiency. I have also focused on the 
need  to  increase  credit  to  SMEs  as  also  look  into  aspects  of  creating  an  enabling  environment  for 
long-term financing. Reduction in NPA levels and appropriate risk management by banks would go a 
long way in improving efficiency of banks and inculcating a sound credit culture.
