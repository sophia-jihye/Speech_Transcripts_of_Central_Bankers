 Svein Gjedrem: Perspectives on the role and effects of monetary policy 
Introduction by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), for the Holden 
Committee of Experts assessing the challenges facing the exposed sector, Oslo, 16 January 2003.  
 Introduction 
The primary objective of monetary policy is to ensure nominal stability.  
There  were  wide  fluctuations  in  the  Norwegian  economy  in  the  1970s  and  1980s.  Economic 
developments were marked by high and variable inflation. Inflation rose gradually and it took a long 
time before it fell.  
The absence of a nominal anchor was one of the main reasons behind these pronounced swings in 
the  Norwegian  economy.  With  a  policy  of  low  interest  rates  and  devaluations,  inflation  took  root. 
Nominal interest rates were kept at a low level even though inflation and the value of tax-deductible 
interest expenditure rose. Frequent devaluations from 1976 were not able to prevent a decline in the 
manufacturing  sector.  On  the  contrary,  they  proved  to  be  self-reinforcing.  The  wide  fluctuations 
culminated in a credit boom in the mid-1980s, followed by a deep recession and high unemployment 
towards the end of the 1980s.  
From the mid-1980s, during and after the credit bubble, it was recognised that a substantial revision in 
economic  policy  would  be  necessary  and  that  the  problems  created  by  inflation  had  to  be  taken 
seriously. The exchange rate was chosen as the nominal anchor. A deterioration in competitiveness 
due to high wage growth would no longer be rectified by means of devaluations. Instead, imbalances 
in  the  labour  market  would  be  counteracted  by  means  of  a  counter-cyclical  policy.  Substantial 
emphasis  was  placed  on  the  importance  of  wage  formation  for  developments  in  employment.  Only 
when wage growth dropped below the level of our trading partners did unemployment begin to fall and 
the manufacturing sector began to pick up. Thus, the fixed exchange rate policy was not introduced in 
order to strengthen the internationally exposed business sector. On the contrary, it was a breach in the 
approach  whereby  monetary  policy  and  “exchange  rate  policy”  had  been  oriented  towards 
safeguarding these sectors. The fixed exchange rate was an intermediate target for achieving low and 
stable inflation.  
The exchange rate remained stable until the autumn of 1996, partly because wage growth was low 
and aggregate demand did not contribute to pressures in the economy. Gradually, the krone began to 
fluctuate  more.  The  experience  of  the  last  half  of  the  1990s  showed  that  monetary  policy  cannot 
fine-tune the exchange rate. Developments in international financial markets provided fertile ground for 
more  pronounced  fluctuations.  And  more  fundamentally,  when  labour  market  pressures  rose  and 
incomes  policy  failed,  exchange  rate  developments  were  no  longer  providing  signals  for  wage 
formation  and  fiscal  policy.  High  petroleum  revenues,  fiscal  slippage  and  expectations  of  increased 
use of petroleum revenues contributed to this. Therefore, the exchange rate was no longer suitable as 
a nominal anchor. 
The introduction of new guidelines for economic policy in March 2001 and the conduct of fiscal policy 
have altered the interplay between economic policy components. 
In the past, growth in public spending was to be reduced or other fiscal policy measures implemented 
if the labour market was tight and wage growth high. With today's guidelines, it is primarily monetary 
policy that is tightened in a similar situation. The rise in labour costs is important when Norges Bank 
assesses  the  outlook  for  price  inflation  and  sets  interest  rates.  Excessive  wage  growth,  in  both 
manufacturing and other industries, will affect the internationally exposed sector through two channels. 
First, high wage growth will in itself reduce earnings and employment. Second, the interest rate will be 
increased. Normally, this will lead to an appreciation of the krone, with a further reduction in earnings 
and employment. The manufacturing sector will therefore feel the effects of excessive wage growth to 
an even greater extent than earlier. Since the new fiscal guidelines, which entail an increased use of 
petroleum revenues, were introduced during a period with a tight labour market, it was to be expected 
that the krone would be strong at times.  
At the same time, it  is important  to  be  aware  that low  wage growth  will  be  of double benefit to the 
exposed business sector. With wage growth as low as in the mid-1990s, partly as a result of incomes

 policy, and other things being equal, the interest rate would probably have to be set in such a way that 
the krone fell in value in order to bring price inflation up to 2.5 per cent. 
How does monetary policy function? 
Monetary policy affects the economy through a number of channels. Let us make a stylised review of 
what happens if the central bank raises the key interest rate. In the short and medium term, this will 
result in a rise in the real interest rate. Normally, the exchange rate will also be strengthened.  
Prices for imported goods are an important part of the consumer price index (CPI). An appreciation of 
the  krone  reduces  prices  for  imported  goods  measured  in  NOK.  This  is  often  called  the  “direct 
exchange rate channel to inflation”. 
The rise in real interest rates reduces consumption and investment demand. This is the “real interest 
rate channel to aggregate demand”. 
With  a  stronger  exchange  rate,  domestically  produced  goods  and  services  will  be  relatively  more 
expensive  than  competing  foreign  products.  Demand  for  domestically  produced  goods  will  decline. 
This is the “exchange-rate channel to aggregate demand”. 
The reduction in aggregate demand will in turn cause a reduction in price inflation. This is the “demand 
channel to inflation”. 
Price inflation and wage inflation are both affected by changes in inflation expectations. Some firms 
set prices for several periods. In wage formation, expected price changes will figure prominently in the 
calculation of expected future real wages. When monetary policy is credible, expectations regarding 
future inflation will be dampened by a rise in the interest rate. A change in expectations will in itself 
contribute  to  curbing  future  price  inflation.  Thus,  the  expectations  channel  amplifies  the  effect  of 
monetary policy. 
The time it takes for a change in the interest rate to affect inflation and demand will vary. During the 
period in which a change in the interest rate affects output and inflation - and often before monetary 
policy has an effect - the economy will be influenced by a number of direct and indirect disturbances. 
Therefore, we cannot fine-tune inflation. 
In our open economy, the exchange rate channel is one of several channels through which monetary 
policy operates. How much the exchange rate appreciates as a result of a rise in key rates depends on 
a number of factors. The effect of the exchange rate channel may therefore vary over time. The more 
the krone appreciates as a result of a rise in interest rates, the less the key rate must be raised in 
order to reduce inflation when tightening policy is appropriate.  
The level of the real exchange rate affects the activity level in business and industry. We take account 
of  the  exchange  rate  channel  and  the  effect  of  the  krone  exchange  rate  on  domestic  activity  and 
inflation  when  preparing  our  inflation  projections.  Thus,  the  exchange  rate  influences  the  setting  of 
interest rates. There is no underlying perception of what the correct exchange rate level in the long 
term should be for the conduct of monetary policy or, of course, of what the correct industry structure 
should be in the long term. This is consistent with an operational target of low and stable inflation and 
with  the  conduct  of  inflation  targeting  in  other  countries.  This  practice  is  also  in  line  with 
recommendations in economic literature. 
Commodity-exporting countries tend to experience wide fluctuations in their exchange rate. Australia is 
one  example.  Fluctuations  in  commodity  prices  lead  to  changes  in  countries’  terms  of  trade,  which 
measures the ratio of export to import prices. Fluctuations in the terms of trade affect the exchange 
rate. This dampens the effects of commodity price changes on profitability in business and industry. 
The  exchange  rate  thus  serves  as  a  buffer  against  changes  in  the  terms  of  trade.  In  Norway,  the 
petroleum  fund  mechanism  and  the  fiscal  guidelines  dampen  the  effect  on  the  exchange  rate  of 
changes in oil prices. 
We have nevertheless stated previously that we must be prepared for fluctuations in the value of our 
currency that are more in line with the fluctuations observed in other countries. The exchange rate will 
vary. The exchange rate may also act as an automatic stabiliser. In periods when economic activity is 
too high - or there are expectations of overheating - the exchange rate may appreciate, even if Norges 
Bank does not change the key rates. Similarly, the exchange rate may depreciate if the activity level is 
too low.

 BIS Review 2/2003
 In  the  long  term,  monetary  policy  determines  the  average  level  of  inflation.  Therefore,  over  time, 
monetary policy also has a significant influence on the nominal exchange rate. Output is determined 
by the supply of labour, capital and technology. Unemployment will depend in part on labour market 
policy, structural policy and institutional arrangements in the labour market. 
Industry  structure  -  or  the  relative  size  of  the  internationally  exposed  and  the  sheltered  sectors  -  is 
determined by a combination of two factors. First, industry structure will be affected by developments 
in  production  technology  in  the  two  sectors.  Second,  industry  structure  will  be  affected  by  how  the 
increase in demand is spread across sectors. The use of petroleum revenues will play a decisive role. 
Monetary policy will not over time affect industry structure. 
The relationship between inflation and long-term unemployment is often presented as a vertical curve. 
In other words, we cannot choose a lower level of unemployment by allowing higher inflation.  
Attempts  to  reduce  unemployment  by  allowing  higher  inflation  can  easily  lead  the  economy  into  a 
situation with accelerating wage and price inflation. This is not sustainable. The real economic costs of 
bringing  high  and  increasing  inflation  under  control  are  considerable.  A  temporary  rise  in 
unemployment  will  be  inevitable.  Gradually,  as  the  share  of  the  long-term  unemployed  increases, 
there is a risk that the relationship between wage growth and unemployment changes. A higher level 
of  unemployment  may  be  the  result  in  the  long  term.  The  labour  supply  will  be  reduced  if 
unemployment leads to increased flows out of the labour market and into social security schemes. We 
experienced  high  inflation  in  the  1970s  and  1980s.  This  period  was  also  marked  by  considerable 
fluctuations in output and employment, followed by a lengthy period of high unemployment.  
There  are  also  real  economic  costs  when  inflation  is  too  low.  To  utilise  resources  most  effectively, 
relative prices must be changed in pace with changes in production conditions and preferences. Some 
inflation will ensure that relative prices can be changed easily without substantial real economic costs. 
In  the  1990s,  the  Norwegian  economy  expanded  sharply,  with  considerable  restructuring  and 
substantial changes in relative wages and income, while inflation was low and stable, averaging about 
2½ per cent. The wheels of the economy run smoothly when monetary policy is oriented towards an 
inflation target of 2½ per cent. Deflation may intensify periods of economic contraction. With deflation, 
the interest rate  will no  longer be an  effective instrument for bringing the economy  out of a cyclical 
downturn.  As  developments  in  Japan  show,  fiscal  policy  instruments  are  not  necessarily  effective 
either. Unemployment can remain high over a long period.  
Therefore,  the  best  contribution  monetary  policy  can  make  to  the  economy  in  the  long  term  is  to 
provide a nominal anchor. It is equally important to avoid an inflation rate that is too low, or deflation, 
as it is to avoid an inflation rate that is too high.  
In  the  short  term,  monetary  policy  can  contribute  to  smoothing  fluctuations,  that  is,  fluctuations  in 
demand and employment. If there is confidence in the nominal anchor, monetary policy will be a more 
effective instrument in short-term stabilisation policy.  
In  the  short  term,  there  is  a  trade-off  between  variation  in  output  and  employment  and  variation  in 
inflation around the inflation target. 
The  chart  illustrates  the  best  possible  combinations  of  variation  in  inflation  and  output  that  can  be 
achieved in the economy. The three points on the chart refer to different forms of inflation targeting.1  
It  would  probably  be  possible,  with  an  aggressive  use  of  instruments,  to  force  inflation  back  to  the 
target within a time-frame of only a few quarters. This is often called strict inflation targeting. Monetary 
policy  has  the  most  rapid  effect  through  the  exchange  rate  channel.  Strict  inflation  targeting  will 
therefore often involve a relatively substantial appreciation of the exchange rate so that inflation can 
be brought down through a fall in imported inflation. 
Monetary policy should not cause unreasonably wide fluctuations in the real economy. We therefore 
apply a two-year horizon to achieve the  inflation target. In practice,  we allow  inflation to  vary in the 
very short term.

 Another possibility would be to place weight solely on minimising variation in output or unemployment. 
This kind of policy does not improve the growth potential in the economy, but smooths fluctuations. 
Furthermore,  this  would  generate  very  large  variations  in  inflation  as  the  economy  would  then  be 
without a nominal anchor. This policy would in practice be unsustainable because it does not provide 
the  answer  to  how  monetary  policy  should  respond  to  wage  -  and  cost-driven  unemployment.  This 
would mean ignoring the experiences of the 1970s and 1980s. 
If economic agents feel confident that inflation will remain low and stable, and take account of this in 
their behaviour, inflation will move more quickly towards the target. The interest rate will then need to 
be adjusted less each time inflation has to be brought back to the target. This will also result in more 
stable developments in output and employment.2 
Developments  in  financial  markets  after  inflation  targeting  was  introduced  indicate  that  market 
participants are confident that we will keep inflation low and stable. This is reflected, for example, in 
the long-term interest rate differential between Norway and the euro area. The interest rate differential 
currently  stands  at  around  1  percentage  point,  which  corresponds  closely  with  the  difference  in 
monetary policy objectives. Confidence among financial market participants is an important asset if it 
proves necessary to use monetary policy to sustain the level of economic activity. It also lays the basis 
for lower interest rates over time. We do not have to pay an additional risk premium because there is 
uncertainty about inflation. Maintaining a firm monetary policy over time is therefore highly valuable in 
itself. 
On the other hand, the outcome of last year’s wage settlement, and the debate that followed, indicate 
that the social partners have not yet internalised the monetary policy response pattern ensuing from 
the mandate laid down by the Government and the Storting.3 
Exchange rate developments 
The krone has appreciated considerably since summer 2000. There may be many reasons for this.  
Relationships in the foreign exchange market are unstable. There are nevertheless some fundamental 
forces  that  influence  the  krone  exchange  rate.  The  phasing  in  of  petroleum  revenues  and  the 
economic  situation  affect  the  exchange  rate.  In  addition,  the  real  exchange  rate  has  a  tendency  to 
return  to  its  normal  level  if  there  are  substantial  deviations  over  time.  Moreover,  the  krone  can  be 
influenced by shifts and changes in wage formation, and the krone exchange rate can also be affected 
by external factors. 
Increased spending of petroleum revenues or expectations of increased use of petroleum revenues 
may  lead  to  an  appreciation  of  the  krone.  Increased  use  of  petroleum  revenues  over  the  central 
government budget implies higher demand. The contest for economic resources will then result in a 
further scaling back of internationally exposed industries to make room for more sheltered activities. 
With  low  and  stable  inflation,  this  restructuring  might  take  place  as  a  result  of  a  stronger  krone 
exchange rate. 
Such  exchange  rate  movements  will  typically  come  in  waves.  As  petroleum  revenues  are  being 
phased in, the real interest rate will tend to rise. The real exchange rate may appreciate, which means 
deterioration in competitiveness. The real krone exchange rate may move more in the short term than 
is necessary in the long term. The krone may be expected to depreciate at a later stage because a 
higher  real  interest  rate,  combined  with  expectations  of  a  depreciation  of  the  krone,  contribute  to 
convergence between the expected real return on capital invested in Norway and in other countries.4 
Moreover,  there  may  be  additional  fluctuations  in  the  krone  exchange  rate  if  market  expectations 
concerning  the  use  of  petroleum  revenues  deviate  from  what  is  actually  the  case.  Given  today's

 exchange rate, it would appear that foreign exchange operators have already factored in a substantial 
increase in the use of petroleum revenues. 
Cyclical divergence is reflected in the interest rate differential between Norway and Germany and the 
US.  What  makes  the  current  situation  unusual  is  the  extremely  low  foreign  interest  rates.  Foreign 
interest rates have been reduced substantially to counter a downturn. High and widening interest rate 
differentials have probably contributed to the appreciation of the krone. Cyclical divergence is probably 
also reflected in the substantially higher wage growth in Norway compared with other countries.  
In  our  view,  the  strong  krone  exchange  rate  cannot  solely  be  attributed  to  the  change  in  the  fiscal 
policy guidelines introduced in March 2001, which allowed for a moderate and steady phasing-in of 
petroleum revenues. The strong krone is also the result of an overheated labour market and relatively 
high wage growth in Norway5 combined with a global downturn following a long period of expansion. 
Results from recent empirical analyses at Norges Bank indicate that the positive and widening interest 
rate  differential  is  the  main  reason  for  the  appreciation  of  the  krone  from  May  2000  and  up  to  late 
autumn  2002.  At  the  same  time,  the  fall  in  equity  prices  and  reduced  volatility  in  foreign  exchange 
markets have contributed to the appreciation of the krone. These factors have contributed because the 
interest rate differential has been positive. Thus they amplify the effect of the interest rate differential. 
Part of the appreciation in the past year may also be due to higher oil prices. Previous research6 has 
shown that changes in the price of oil have an impact on the krone exchange rate particularly when 
the price falls below USD 14 or exceeds USD 20 per barrel. 
A measure of the real exchange rate is the trade-weighted exchange rate index (TWI) in relation to 
relative price developments between Norway and its trading partners. The real krone exchange rate 
has fluctuated around a long-term average level over the past 30 years. The krone exchange rate has 
a  tendency  to  return  relatively  quickly  to  its  normal  level  if  there  are  deviations  from  the  long-term 
average level.7 Differences in price inflation between Norway and other countries have gradually been 
evened  out  by  changes  in  the  krone  exchange  rate.  This  relationship  has  been  robust  even  when 
there have been considerable changes in economic policy. However, the revision of economic policy 
in  spring  2001,  with  the  introduction  of  a  new  fiscal  guideline  and  an  inflation  target  for  monetary 
policy,  may  still  have  an  impact  on  how  quickly  differences  in  price  inflation  level  out  in  the  years 
ahead. 
Purchasing power parity can be illustrated by developments during the last 30 years of the German 
mark's life as a currency. In 1970, a German mark cost about 2 kroner. In 1986/87, it cost about 4 
kroner. The exchange rate remained relatively stable in the following years. On the other hand, prices 
rose about twice as quickly in Norway as in Germany from 1970 to 1986. However, both the exchange 
rate  and  prices  relative  to  Germany  were  stable  from  the  end  of  the  1980s  until  the  German  mark 
ceased to be a currency. 
A year and a half ago, the Government and the Storting adopted new guidelines for economic policy. 
Norges Bank’s mandate states the following: 
"Monetary policy shall be aimed at stability in the Norwegian krone’s national and international value, 
contributing  to  stable  expectations  concerning  exchange  rate  developments.  At  the  same  time, 
monetary  policy  shall  underpin  fiscal  policy  by  contributing  to  stable  developments  in  output  and 
employment.” 
"Norges  Bank’s  implementation  of  monetary  policy  shall,  in  accordance  with  the  first  paragraph,  be 
oriented towards  low  and  stable  inflation. The operational target  of monetary policy shall  be annual 
consumer price inflation of approximately 2.5 per cent over time.” 
The first paragraph of the mandate sets forth its intentions. The last paragraph specifies what Norges 
Bank is required to do. The first sentence in the mandate refers to the value of the krone. Stability in

 the internal value of the krone implies that inflation must be low and stable. The sentence also states 
that monetary policy shall be aimed at stability in the external value of the krone. The krone exchange 
rate  fluctuates  from  day  to  day,  from  week  to  week,  and  from  month  to  month.  We  have  free 
international  trade  and  free  capital  movements. We  do  not  have  the  instruments  for  fine-tuning  the 
exchange rate.  But  when the implementation of monetary  policy  is oriented towards low and stable 
inflation, this will contribute to a stable krone exchange rate over time (see charts). 
Different real economic developments across countries may nevertheless affect real exchange rates. 
Sweden is an example of this. Economic developments in Norway’s neighbouring country have been 
fairly weak over the past 30 years. GDP has fallen by 20 per cent in relation to GDP in the euro area. 
At  the  same  time,  the  real  value  of  the  Swedish  krona  has  declined  by  about  40  per  cent  against 
European  currencies.  Sluggish  price  trends  for  Swedish  export  goods  and  the  deterioration  in  the 
Swedish balance of payments have contributed to the decline. In Norway too, changes in productivity 
and terms of trade may have an impact on the real exchange rate in the years ahead. However, it is 
important to be aware that the real exchange rate functions as an automatic stabiliser in these cases. 
The Swedish economy recorded weaker economic growth - more sluggish productivity gains - than its 
trading partners, reducing the competitiveness of Swedish firms. This resulted in a depreciation of the 
krona, however, thereby dampening the impact on competitiveness.
