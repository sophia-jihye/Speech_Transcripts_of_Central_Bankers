 Svein Gjedrem: Economic perspectives 
Annual  address  by  Mr  Svein  Gjedrem,  Governor  of  Norges  Bank  (Central  Bank  of  Norway),  at  the 
meeting of the Supervisory Council of Norges Bank, Oslo, 20 February 2003  
 The  global  economy  is  ailing,  plagued  by  a  recent  history  of  unsound  investments,  a  fall  in  equity 
prices  and  fears  of  terror  and  war.  In  Norway,  employees  obtained  the  strongest  increase  in  real 
wages  for  a  generation  in  2002.  Petroleum  revenues  have  generated  excessive  optimism.  The 
imbalances  caused  by  the  combination  of  global  stagnation  and  the  high  Norwegian  cost  level  are 
leading to job losses and higher unemployment.  
Why has the krone appreciated? 
The krone is strong. As a result, prices for imported goods have fallen. This has led to low and stable 
inflation in spite of sharp wage growth. It would appear that inflation will also remain low in the years 
ahead.

 The krone  exchange  rate  fluctuates.  This  is  not  surprising  because  other  countries’  currencies  also 
fluctuate. The Swedish krona depreciated sharply in 1992. Since then it has remained weak, but has 
shown wide variations. Pound sterling appreciated by more than 20 per cent between 1996 and 1998, 
reflecting solid growth in the UK  economy from the mid-1990s. A currency  that has exhibited  wider 
swings  than  most  is  the  New  Zealand  dollar.  A  sharp  appreciation  up  to  the  mid-1990s  was 
subsequently  reversed.  Over  the  past  two  years,  this  currency  has  moved  in  tandem  with  the 
Norwegian krone. 
The  krone  exchange  rate  is  the  price  of  our  currency  measured  in  terms  of  a  foreign  currency. 
Developments in other countries are just as important for the krone as developments in the Norwegian 
economy. 
Capital flows freely and flows can change rapidly. This can spill over to exchange rates and interest 
rates as well as output and employment.

 Currency swings are driven by cross-border capital movements. Capital flows were heavily influenced 
by investor focus on stock market returns until the downturn began. In the US, equity prices almost 
trebled between 1995 and 2000. Stock markets in other countries followed suit. Capital inflows into the 
stock market resulted in a strong dollar. However, expectations concerning corporate earnings were 
higher  than  later  proved  to  be  warranted.  When  expectations  were  lowered,  equity  prices  fell.  The 
decline  was  amplified  after the downturn  in the global economy deepened as  a result of terror  and 
fears  of  war.  Investors  sought  to  avert  the  risk  in  the  stock  market.  Demand  for  bonds  increased, 
resulting in low long-term interest rates.

 In response to heightened uncertainty and fears of war, traditional safe havens for capital, such as the 
Swiss  franc  and  gold,  have  become  increasingly  attractive.  The  Swiss  franc  appreciated  after  the 
terrorist  attacks  on  11  September  2001  and  towards  the  end  of  last  year.  Gold  prices  moved  up 
sharply after UN Security Council Resolution 1441 was adopted on 8 November last year. 
Oil  prices  fell  markedly  after  11  September  2001,  but  have  since  risen.  Fears  of  war  in  Iraq  have 
increased  the  uncertainty  surrounding  global  oil  supplies.  Strategic  oil  reserves  have  risen,  while 
private reserves are low. This has exerted upward pressure on oil prices. The strike in Venezuela has 
also had an impact. 
Major economies such as the US, Germany and France are struggling with stagnation and fears of 
recession. Substantial tax relief and low interest rates are holding up activity in the US. The Japanese 
economy has been in a deflationary recession for a long period.

 In  recent  years,  the  krone  exchange  rate  has  shadowed  the  difference  between  Norwegian  and 
foreign short-term rates. This is why the krone has appreciated to its current strong level. In addition, 
high oil prices have had an influence. The effect of the interest rate differential on the krone has been 
intensified by conditions in capital markets. Investors have been favouring carry trades. Risk premiums 
in  major  currency  markets  have  been  low,  which  seems  to  indicate  that  investors  have  been  less 
prone to speculate in exchange rate fluctuations.

 As equity prices fell, investors started seeking alternative vehicles. This made the krone market more 
attractive.  The  krone  appreciated  at  the  same  time  that  foreign  stock  markets  and  domestic  equity 
prices fell. Bonds and other interest-bearing securities have been of particular interest.

 This  is  reflected  in  the  international  market  for  bonds  issued  in  NOK.  Last  year,  such  bond  issues 
amounted to more than NOK 50 billion. Both foreign and Norwegian companies were issuers and a 
number  of  small  and  large  foreign  investors  and  Norwegian  companies  -  primarily  life  insurance 
companies - were buyers. 
The relationships in the foreign exchange market are unstable. New shifts in the world economy may 
reduce interest in the krone.

 As  a  result  of  the  strong  krone  and  a  high  wage  level,  competitiveness  in  business  and  industry  is 
close  to  15  per  cent  weaker  than  the  average  for  the  past  30  years.  Historically,  following  such 
substantial  deviations,  competitiveness  has  always  returned  to  the  average  fairly  rapidly.  Market 
participants  weigh  the  interest  rate  differential  between  Norway  and  other  countries  against  the 
likelihood  of  a  depreciation  of  the  krone  in  the  future.  Cyclical  divergence  can  cause  the  krone  to 
overshoot its future level in the short term. However, in the long term, the krone cannot remain this 
strong. This would require a substantial improvement in our capacity to generate income. 
What are the factors behind the wide interest rate differential? 
With the krone exchange rate prevailing at end-January, competitiveness had weakened by a little less 
than 25 per cent since 1996. The krone had appreciated by almost 10 per cent.

 In the same period, wages in Norwegian manufacturing increased by close to 15 per cent more than 
wages  among  trading  partners.  In  the  years  around  the  millennium,  the  depreciation  of  the  krone 
veiled the underlying deterioration in competitiveness. In May 2000, the krone hit its lowest level in six 
years1. The krone has since appreciated, and the effect of high wage growth has gradually come into 
evidence in company accounts. 
In the ten years that have passed since the banking and currency crisis in 1992, the economy featured 
a long period of balanced growth. However, towards the end of the upturn the economy was facing 
labour  shortages,  higher  wage  growth  and  a  sharp  increase  in  household  consumption  and  debt. 
Interest rates had to be kept at a high level in Norway.

 The turnaround abroad took place two years ago, but the Norwegian economy continued to show a 
high level of activity. This led to a widening of the interest rate differential against other countries. The 
main explanation for the wide interest rate differential is not that interest rates are high in Norway, but 
that interest rates are at a historic low abroad. Interest rates in the US have not been at such a low 
level since the 1960s. 
                                                      
1   Measured by the monthly average of the import-weighted exchange rate against 44 countries, the krone was at its weakest 
level in May 2000 since May 1994. Measured by the monthly average of the trade-weighted exchange rate index, the krone 
was at its weakest level in May 2002 since the series was started in January 1971. Measured by both indices, there were a 
few days in autumn and winter 1998 when the krone was weaker than in May 2000. 
  A further jump in wages in 2002 amplified the imbalances in the economy and fuelled the rise in prices 
for goods and services produced in Norway. This is why monetary policy has been tight.

 The  real  interest  rate,  i.e.  the  interest  rate  adjusted  for  inflation,  rose  in  2000  and  was  thereafter 
somewhat higher than the average for the past 30 years. With the reduction in the key rate this winter, 
the real interest rate is no longer particularly high. The tight monetary stance is reflected in the strong 
krone. 
Is there a risk of prolonged stagnation? 
The US has been the driving force in the world economy. The US economy has historically been very 
resilient. Growth tends to pick up rapidly after short periods of contraction. Most likely this will prove to 
be the case this time as well. A positive aspect is that confidence in the financial system has not been 
impaired. There is some evidence of a recovery in investment. 
However, we cannot exclude the possibility of a fairly long period of stagnation in the global economy. 
Low interest rates in the US and Europe are a reflection of this risk. The level of investment in the US 
was high during the expansion, which may have resulted in excess capacity in the business sector. 
The fall in equity prices is having a negative effect on household wealth. In addition, US household 
saving is low and low interest rates have induced households to accumulate debt. The fall in the value 
of the dollar may make a contribution, but growth in the business sector is still not self-driven and the 
depreciation  of  the  dollar  is  reducing  other  countries’  exports.  The  impetus  generated  by  the  US 
economy may be weak for several years ahead. 
Nor  is  the  rest  of  the  world  showing  clear  signs  of  an  imminent  recovery.  Japan  is  dragging  down 
growth in the world economy. The large European economies, in particular Germany, are stagnating. 
Unemployment is high, but the growth potential appears to be low. 
Interest rates in the US and Japan have been reduced to such a low level that there is little room for 
further stimulus. The monetary policy authorities could use more unorthodox measures. For example, 
the central bank could purchase massive volumes of long-term bonds -  as seen in Japan -  or other 
assets. It is uncertain how effective such measures are. Traditional fiscal policy instruments may also 
prove  to be ineffective  when budget deficits are rising sharply. This may fuel  expectations of future 
fiscal retrenchment and tax increases. 
If the world economy continues to stagnate over a longer period, the effects will also spill over to the 
Norwegian economy. The decline in traditional exports will then persist. Sooner or later, the oil market 
will also feel the effects of the downturn and oil prices will decline. If the world economy experiences 
prolonged stagnation and the krone remains firm, a markedly lower interest rate will contribute to a 
weakening of the krone and mitigate the effects for Norway. On the other hand, any fiscal slippage will 
contribute to maintaining a strong krone. 
  A  precondition  for  countering  a  possible  downturn  by  means  of  monetary  policy  easing  is  slower 
growth in labour costs. Monetary policy cannot prevent an increase in unemployment that is caused by 
a significantly higher rate of growth in labour costs in Norway compared with other countries. 
A  stagnating  global  economy  has  changed  the  domestic  inflation  outlook  in  recent  months.  World 
stock markets have continued to decline. It does not appear that interest rates in the US and Europe 
will  increase  in  the  near  future.  They  may  even  be  reduced  further  before  the  recovery  starts.  In 
Norway, the interest rate has also been reduced. At the same time, fiscal policy is stimulating activity, 
partly through tax reductions and growth in government allocations. In addition, state finances weaken 
when  the  economy  shows  little  growth  and  unemployment  rises.  As  a  result  of  the  strong  krone, 
however, overall economic policy is tight. With an equally tight policy ahead, inflation would probably 
have  been  lower  than  the  inflation  target.  A  gradual  easing  of  monetary  policy  would  thus  seem 
appropriate. 
Does the inflation target promote stability? 
The operational target of monetary policy as defined by the Government is inflation of close to 2.5 per 
cent  over  time.  The  inflation  target  provides  economic  agents  with  an  anchor  for  their  decisions 
concerning  saving,  investment,  budgets  and  wages.  Households,  businesses,  public  entities, 
employees  and  employers  can  base  decisions  on  the  assumption  that  inflation  in  Norway  will  be 
2½ per cent over time. 
The responsibility for implementing monetary policy has been delegated to the central bank. This is 
also the case in comparable countries. The central bank shall exercise professional judgement within 
the framework of its mandate. Assessments of economic developments and the basis for interest rate 
decisions  are  presented  to  the  public.  This  makes  it  possible  for  others  to  gain  insight  into  the 
assumptions and analyses underlying interest rate decisions. 
The  operational  target  is  well  defined.  The  Bank’s  judgement  can  therefore  be  evaluated 
retrospectively.  Norges  Bank  explains  the  reasoning  behind  its  judgement  in  its  annual  report.  The 
Bank’s  reporting  requirement  is  set  out  in  §  75,  litra  c  of  the  Constitution,  which  stipulates  that  the 
Storting  shall  supervise  Norway’s  monetary  system.  Up  to  1950,  the  annual  report  was  submitted 
directly to the Storting. Today, in keeping with the Norges Bank Act, it is sent to the Ministry of Finance 
for submission to the King in Council and communication to the Storting in the Government’s credit 
report. The law thereby provides a framework that allows the government authorities to follow up the 
performance of the delegated responsibility for monetary policy. 
Norges Bank sets the interest rate so that future inflation will be equal to the inflation target of 2½ per 
cent. High demand for goods and services and labour shortages normally point to higher inflation in 
the future. When interest rates are increased, demand falls and inflation is kept at bay. When demand 
is  low  and  unemployment  rises,  inflation  will  tend  to  slow.  Interest  rates  will  then  be  reduced.  The 
inflation target is a vehicle for, not an obstacle to, monetary policy’s contribution to stabilising output 
and employment. This intention is also expressed in the Regulation on Monetary Policy. 
The inflation target of 2½ per cent is broadly in line with the inflation targets of our trading partners. It 
is also an anchor for developments in the krone exchange rate. The krone fluctuates. We have open 
trade with other countries and free capital movements. We do not have the instruments to fine-tune 
the krone exchange rate. As long as inflation remains low and stable, any substantial deviations in the 
krone exchange rate over time will have a considerable impact on activity in business and industry. As 
a  result,  the  krone  exchange  rate  will  tend  to  return  towards  its  long-term  mean  following  any 
substantial  deviations.  The  best  contribution  monetary  policy  can  make  to  stability  in  the  krone 
exchange rate is to aim at low and stable inflation. 
Wide cyclical differences and differences in wage formation between Norway and other countries have 
always  had  an  impact  on  the  krone  exchange  rate  and  competitiveness.  The  central  bank  alone 
cannot, with the instruments at its disposal, steer the exchange rate. 
During  the  years  when  a  fixed  or  stable  exchange  rate  was  the  objective  of  monetary  policy,  fiscal 
policy was responsible for smoothing fluctuations in the economy. At the same time, incomes policy’s 
role was to keep wage growth in line with wage growth abroad. The objective of exchange rate stability 
therefore provided a framework for economic policy. 
  When foreign interest rates moved up, the interest rate in Norway also had to be raised in order to 
prevent a weakening of the krone. Conversely, interest rates in Norway were often reduced following a 
reduction in interest rates abroad. 
One can imagine how this division of responsibility would have been implemented in the face of the 
disturbances to the Norwegian economy which occurred in 2001 and 2002. The upward tendency of 
the krone would have led to reductions in the interest rate down to the international level. As a result, 
interest  rates  would  also  have  reached  a  historical  low  in  Norway.  Low  interest  rates  would  have 
fuelled  lending  growth,  pushed  up  house  prices  and  intensified  the  shortage  of  labour.  In  order  to 
prevent  another  bubble  of  this  type  in  the  Norwegian  economy,  substantial  fiscal  policy  tightening 
would have been required in 2001, 2002 and 2003. 
The fiscal rule stipulates that the central government budget deficit shall over time be equivalent to the 
expected  real  return  on  the  Government  Petroleum  Fund.  The  rule  is  robust  to  variations  in 
government  revenues  and  provides  a  stable  framework for  economic  developments. The fiscal  rule 
has been adhered to, which in itself makes a considerable contribution to stability. 
Monetary  policy  has  been  assigned  a  clear  responsibility  for  stabilising  the  economy.  Inflationary 
pressures are addressed using a different approach than earlier. Monetary policy keeps inflation under 
control. This may translate into high interest rates and in periods a strong krone. 
The alternative could have been higher inflation, with a continued contest for economic resources and 
persistently  high  wage  growth.  This  would  have  resulted  in  a  continued  deterioration  in  business 
sector  competitiveness  year  after  year  as  a  result  of  higher  price  and  cost  inflation  in  Norway  than 
abroad. The experience of the 1970s and 1980s shows that inflation and wage growth do not have a 
stable anchor under these conditions. Inflation  and  wage growth  would  have  continued to move up 
until monetary policy was tightened. Unleashing inflation is not a viable alternative. 
Why is unemployment rising? 
High labour costs, a strong krone and global stagnation are leaving a mark on Norway’s internationally 
exposed sector. Many enterprises will not be able to sustain activity given current market conditions 
and  cost  levels.  Labour  costs  are  also  squeezing  margins  in  some  private  service  industries.  More 
enterprises are competing on international markets. Moreover, even if allocations are growing, public 
entities  have  limited  capacity  for  increasing  employment  because  wage  expenses  have  risen  so 
sharply.

 Unemployment has edged up recently. The current unemployment rate of 4 per cent is more or less on 
a par with unemployment in 1997. It is also 2 percentage points lower than the average number of 
unemployed and persons participating in labour market programmes in the 1990s. For manufacturing, 
the  effect  of  weak  profitability  has  not  yet  come  into  full  evidence.  Unemployment  is  therefore 
expected to increase somewhat in the period ahead. 
  In spite of the high level of wage growth, inflation is low. Conditions are now conducive to a gradual 
narrowing of the interest rate differential between Norway and abroad. How tight monetary policy will 
be is essentially contingent on how fast wage growth is brought down. 
The inflation targets adopted by Norway and our trading partners imply that total wage growth of about 
4½ per cent is consistent with little or no change in business sector competitiveness. This is based on 
the  assumption  that  productivity  growth  in  Norway  is  around  2  per  cent,  or  about  the  same  as  the 
average for the past 20 years. Both companies and employees can take as a given that inflation will 
be 2½ per cent over time. This reduces uncertainty and makes it possible for the social partners to 
disregard brief spells of somewhat lower or somewhat higher inflation. 
Inflation  does  not  have  to  be  higher  than  2½  per  cent  in  Norway  to  achieve  growth  and  high 
employment. The  experience of the  1990s demonstrates this. During that  period unemployment fell 
and growth was strong. Even with major restructuring and changes in industry structure, inflation was 
close to 2½ per cent.  
Growth in real wages is now markedly higher than the underlying growth in productivity. This is why 
unemployment is rising. Businesses must adjust their workforces to sustain profitability. This leads to a 
fall in employment, but also continued operations in Norway. The alternative is that companies are not 
able  to  adjust  their  workforces  quickly  enough.  If  higher  costs  cannot  be  passed  on  to  customers, 
earnings will fall and the wage share rise. This may lead to closures or relocation of production.

 The wage share in Norwegian manufacturing has increased. The situation in service industries is more 
mixed. Import firms have  wider margins. We know that  employment in some service industries has 
fallen.  This  may  indicate  that  many  service  enterprises  have  adjusted  their  workforces.  To  some 
extent, higher costs can more easily be passed on to customers through higher prices in this sector. 
This  picture  is  typical  of  the  final  phase  of  an  expansion.  A  tight  labour  market  and  the  contest  for 
economic resources lead to a sharp increase in real wages. This results in high growth in household 
income, consumption and housing investment. The propensity to borrow increases and house prices 
rise sharply. On the other hand, the business sector faces pressures on profitability, a high cost level 
and declining investment. Commercial property prices fall. At the same time, corporate restructuring 
brings growth in employment to a halt. When costs reach a high level, employment starts to fall. The 
period of expansion has then come to an end. The cost level must be adjusted to restore balance in 
the labour market. 
Wage formation in Norway is subject to an institutional and statutory framework and agreements that 
have  been  developed  over  several  decades.  The  result  of  negotiations  is  influenced  by  labour 
legislation, including regulations relating to job protection, unemployment benefits and the rules that 
apply to cooperation and settlement of industrial disputes. 
In important segments of the labour market, there appears to have been a shift in the social partners’ 
strategic position in negotiations in favour of employees. Technological changes, increased demands 
for stable supplies and intensified international competition have made enterprises in many industries 
  ever more vulnerable to even short operational disruptions. The employers’ ability and willingness to 
take on open labour conflicts have therefore diminished.  
On the other hand, corporate boards and management are responsible for decisions on expansions, 
closures, rationalisation, location and workforce increases. Unions have little direct influence on these 
matters.  If  company  costs  increase,  either  productivity  must  be  improved,  production  closed  or 
relocated  to  another  country.  This  is  the  companies’  arena.  Their  decisions  concerning  operations, 
investment and location are in turn determined by the required rate of return that owners set to keep 
their capital in the company. 
Under these operating parameters, developments in labour costs essentially reflect employees’ and 
their  organisations’ assessment of the trade-off between real  wage  growth and employment. These 
organisations cannot assume that others can safeguard their members’ jobs when they determine how 
high pay increases should be. 
The pay increases for white-collar workers in the business and financial sector and academics in the 
public sector have been  particularly  high. For a  long period, this mirrored the high  wage growth for 
liberal professions, consultancy firms, law firms and the IT industry. However, wage growth for white-
collar workers and academics appears to be holding up even with weaker labour market conditions for 
these groups. In many places in our country, public sector wages are higher than the level that can be 
sustained by local businesses in a less favourable economic environment. 
It may appear that wages for white-collar workers are first increased in line with that of other groups 
and then supplemented by individual increases based on performance and profits. The overall rise in 
wages does not seem to be adapted to the situation now faced by many enterprises or to an ample 
supply of labour. The system for determining these groups’ wages may be an unnecessary source of 
cost increases for enterprises and public entities. 
Last  year’s  wage  settlements  resulted  in  wide  differences  in  pay  increases  across  different  groups. 
This may give rise to renewed tension between occupational groups and new wage spirals. Because 
substantial pay increases negotiated in 2002 will take effect in 2003, wage growth will also be high this 
year even without any new generous pay increases. It may take time and be very costly for business 
and public entities to resolve the problems caused by last year’s wage settlements. It will only be well 
into 2004 before we can assess how high the unemployment rate will be in this business cycle. 
One of the richest countries in the world? 
Norway’s  position  as  petroleum  exporter  may  have  influenced  wage  developments  and  affected 
household optimism and eagerness to borrow. The risk of job losses and a rise in unemployment may 
have been underestimated. Cash flows from the petroleum sector may give rise to the perception that 
Norway is one of the absolute richest countries in the world.

   The  large  cash  flows  from  petroleum  activities  are  reflected  in  official  income  figures.  Measured  by 
GDP  per  capita,  Norway  ranks  high  in  the  statistics.  These  figures  do  not,  however,  provide  an 
accurate picture of value added. 
When calculating GDP and national income, the cash flow from petroleum activities is measured in the 
same way as all other income. Extracting oil and gas from the seabed is measured in the same way as 
all other production. This means that Norway’s income is overestimated. Oil and gas represent wealth 
under the seabed. When oil and gas are sold, this wealth is invested abroad. This transaction does not 
in itself generate income, even though it is posted as income in the national accounts. The income is 
not equivalent to the entire cash flow, only to the return on this wealth.

 A  more  accurate  picture  of  Norway’s  income  is  obtained  when  GDP  is  adjusted  for  the  transfer  of 
petroleum wealth to financial investments abroad. The so-called “permanent income” from petroleum 
activities  can  be  used  to  calculate  the  return  both  on  today’s  Petroleum  Fund  and  on  future 
investments. The value of labour input in the petroleum sector comes in addition.  
With this more accurate picture, the income level in Norway is not particularly high. Norway’s income 
is approximately  on a level with other Western countries such as Australia and Germany, while the 
level in, for example, Canada and Denmark is considerably higher.

 Norway’s income is generated through labour. Income growth in the 1990s was unusually strong as a 
result  of  substantial  productivity  gains  and  a  sharp  increase  in  employment.  Major  technological 
advances  were  achieved  in  the  petroleum  industry,  and  productivity  growth  in  private  services  was 
especially  high  -    particularly  in  retail  trade,  financial  services  and  telecommunications  and  postal 
  services. In retail trade, nationwide chains boosted efficiency. New technology and improved services 
provided new impetus to the financial  industry. The telecommunications and  postal services started 
operating on normal commercial terms.  
A number of conditions were conducive to favourable developments in the 1990s. Wage growth was 
moderate for a long period and interest rates were low. Banks regained their strength after the banking 
crisis. The tax reform stimulated innovation and strengthened the incentive to work. The reorganisation 
of state-owned commercial enterprises enhanced efficiency and value added. It is unlikely that gains 
of this magnitude will be achieved in this decade.  
Today, the greatest potential for new and substantial improvements is probably to be found within the 
public service sector. Norway has a high level of spending for schools and education compared with 
other countries. The considerable potential for efficiency gains in public administration, particularly in 
local government, has been amply documented. The reorganisation of the regional health authorities 
promises  an  increase  in  efficiency.  The  organisational  challenges  are  nevertheless  considerably 
greater  than  they  were  for  Telenor  and  Norway  Post.  In  hospitals  managed  by  the  regional  health 
authorities,  the  patient’s  bill  is  covered  by  the  central  government  and  competition  is  -    for  obvious 
reasons  -    highly  limited.  In  this  context,  therefore,  other  instruments  to  promote  efficiency  are 
required. Hospitals must have reasonable prospects of being able to provide satisfactory services to 
the  public  over  time.  On  the  other  hand,  establishing  a  framework  that  the  hospital  authorities  and 
employees  perceive  as  binding  and  credible  is  not  an  easy  task  for  the  central  government.  Thus, 
encouraging hospitals to seek the most efficient solutions probably represents a particular challenge.  
Is it wise to invest in equities? 
The cash flow from petroleum activities to the Treasury resulted in a government budget surplus -  as 
this is measured - of almost 10 per cent of GDP in 2002. The central government invests this amount 
abroad  through  the  Petroleum  Fund.  This  results  in  capital  outflows  and  a  balance-of-payments 
surplus.  The  central  government  builds  up  assets,  but  also  obligations  through  the  social  security 
system. Even if a large share of oil revenues is set aside, it would appear that, in the long term, the 
level  of  direct  and  indirect  taxes  will  have  to  be  at  least  maintained  in  order  to  honour  these 
obligations. 
Petroleum revenues would normally have resulted in substantial currency inflows into Norway. If we 
had  used  this  capital  domestically,  we  would  have  had  to  convert  this  currency  into  NOK.  The 
attendant increase in demand for kroner would have resulted in an even sharper appreciation of the 
krone  exchange  rate.  The  capital  outflow  through  the  Petroleum  Fund  contributes  to  curbing  the 
appreciation of the krone. With oil and gas production now reaching its peak, Norway has -  and must 
have -  a substantial balance-of-payments surplus. 
The return on the Petroleum Fund will to some extent make up for the fall in petroleum revenues in the 
period ahead. In about 15 years, the return on the Fund may exceed the cash flow from petroleum 
activities. Norway’s position as international investor may then overshadow its position as an oil and 
gas producer. Swings in capital markets may have a greater impact on central government finances 
than oil price fluctuations. 
We are now in a phase where petroleum wealth is being invested at home and abroad. Norway is -  
and has to be -  an international investor. We must invest abroad in order to safeguard our petroleum 
wealth and maintain a broad-based business sector. This will also be the case if we should decide to 
reform  our  pension  system  in  the  future,  with  a  larger  component  of  public  or  private  fund-based 
schemes.  Risk  diversification  also  favours  the  investment  of  capital  abroad.  The  state  is  already  a 
dominant  owner  in  many  of  Norway's  largest  companies.  Future  government  tax  revenues  will  also 
largely depend on the growth potential of the Norwegian economy.  
The safest investment an individual or a small firm can make is to deposit their money in a bank. The 
return on bank deposits may be low, but for small amounts it is safe. The central government cannot, 
however, safeguard  its capital by  depositing tens of billions of kroner in banks. Investments can be 
made in two main types of instruments: bonds and equities. The international bond market is about the 
same size as the equity market. 
Government bonds are a relatively safe investment, but the return is low. Long-term interest rates in 
the US and Europe are currently around 4 per cent. New investments will thus achieve an annual real 
rate  of  return  of  1½-2  per  cent.  By  way  of  comparison,  the  authorities  have  based  their  use  of 
  petroleum revenues over the central government budget on the assumption that the Petroleum Fund 
can achieve a long-term real return of 4 per cent. It is unlikely that this rate of return will be achieved if 
we only invest in bonds. 
In the long term, there may even be a risk associated with investments in government bonds. This has 
been experienced by the Norwegian state. The State Reserve Fund, established in 1904, lost much of 
its  capital  during  the  First  World  War  as  a  result  of  losses  on  investments  in  German  and  French 
government bonds.2

 Buying a bond means lending money to others. Buying equities is the same as investing in real assets. 
Buying equities gives us direct ownership of the means of production in global business and industry. 
On the one hand, these ownership rights provide high returns when companies are flourishing. On the 
other, shareholders are the first to sustain losses when companies fail. As a result, returns on equities 
fluctuate far more than returns on bonds, reflecting the higher level of risk. Over the past 75  years, 
equity returns in the US market have been negative almost every third year.

 An investor will only invest in high-risk vehicles if it is reasonable to expect compensation for the risk. 
The compensation for high risk in the stock market is a far higher average return for equities compared

  with bonds. Since 1926, the annual return on US equities has on average been 4.8 percentage points 
higher than the return on bonds.  
Also in most ten-year periods, investing in US equities has been profitable, with the exception of the 
depression in the 1930s and the last half of the 1970s. Equity returns have been negative after ten 
years only in the years between 1928 and 1938, in other words on equity investments made the year 
before  the  1929  stock  market  crash.  It  may  also  be  worth  noting  that  equities  purchased  during 
recessions -  such as in the mid-1930s and mid-1970s -  brought solid returns ten years later. This 
picture is the same for most other countries.

 Since short-term fluctuations in equity prices are difficult to predict, it may be a sound strategy to keep 
the share of equities constant over time. This means buying a relatively large volume of equities when 
prices are low, and buying a smaller volume -  or selling -  when prices are high. This is the strategy 
applied by the Petroleum Fund. 
Optimism and pessimism, confidence and doubt influence equity prices. In periods when markets are 
characterised by optimism and confidence in the future, equity prices tend to be high. When markets 
are marked by pessimism and fear, prices tend to be low. The actual income flow from equities -  the 
dividend -  depends more on developments in the global economy over time. This is a far more stable 
variable than equity prices. Investing a large share of the capital in bonds diversifies risk even further.  
We are nevertheless left with the question of whether we are now entering a long period of very low or 
negative returns on investment in global business. This would then imply that there is an unusually low 
growth potential in the global economy, as in the 1930s. 
There  is  little  we  can  do  to  achieve  high  returns  on  investments  if  global  growth  is  weak.  In  this 
situation, not even investments in our own business sector - or for that matter in long-term bonds or 
infrastructure - would generate returns of any size. But even in an economy with low growth, we can 
basically expect to be compensated for risk.  
The global business sector must be profitable in the long run. This must imply that equity investments 
can, in the long run, generate a solid return in relation to other alternatives. 
If prospects for achieving a return should deteriorate, another question is whether we should save less 
and spend more now. However, there are good reasons to maintain the saving ratio. It will be even 
more demanding to finance future pensions for an ageing population if the economy stagnates.  
Conclusion 
The global economy is in the doldrums. Swings in capital markets have a substantial impact on the 
value of wealth accumulated by the central government. However, it is highly unlikely that investing in 
global  business  will  not  be  profitable  in  the  long  run,  and  with  a  high  portion  of  wealth  invested  in 
bonds the risk is spread. 
  It is unlikely that we will achieve the substantial productivity gains seen in the 1990s. The Norwegian 
business sector is facing pressures on profitability, a high cost level and declining investment. Growth 
in real wages is markedly higher than underlying growth in productivity. This is why unemployment is 
rising.  Businesses  must  adjust  their  workforces  to  maintain  profitability,  or  close  down  or  relocate 
production. 
The  inflation  target  is  the  vehicle  for  monetary  policy’s  contribution  to  stabilising  output  and 
employment. In spite of high wage growth, the strong krone has kept inflation at a low level. Global 
stagnation has changed the domestic inflation outlook in recent months. The tight monetary stance is 
reflected in the strong krone. A gradual easing of monetary policy would thus seem appropriate.  
As long as inflation remains low and stable, any substantial deviations in the krone exchange rate over 
time will have an impact on business and industry. As a result, the krone exchange rate will tend to 
return towards its long-term mean. The interest rate differential between Norway and other countries 
has resulted in a strong krone. The wide interest rate differential is due to the historically low level of 
interest rates abroad. If the world economy experiences prolonged stagnation and the krone remains 
firm, a markedly lower interest rate will lead to a weakening of the krone and mitigate the effects for 
Norway. Any fiscal slippage will contribute to maintaining a strong krone.
