Lars Heikensten: Monetary policy - some current issues 
Speech  by  Mr  Lars  Heikensten,  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  the  Stockholm  School  of 
Economics, Economic Association, Stockholm, 10 February 2004. 
 Let  me  begin  by  thanking  you  for  the  invitation  to  come  here  to  the  economic  association.  It  has 
become something of a tradition that the Riksbank Governor comes here once a year to talk about 
current  issues  regarding  monetary  policy.  I  think  this  is  excellent,  particularly  as  it  contributes  to  a 
lively, in-depth discussion of monetary policy in society. Those who have followed the Riksbank and 
monetary policy in recent years know that transparency and clarity have been guiding principles in our 
work. 
Today I intend to provide some perspective on monetary policy by means of a backward glance over 
the past ten years. This is a natural foundation for the current discussion on interest rates which I will 
address a little later. I have no intention of giving any new monetary policy signals today, but to give an 
account  of  the  basis  for  our  repo  rate  decision  last  week.  One  particularly  interesting  question  at 
present  is  productivity  growth,  which  appears  to  have  been  better  than  expected  last  year.  The 
conclusions that can be drawn from this development are my third theme. Finally, I shall give my views 
on the recent monetary policy debate, something I have been asked about on numerous occasions in 
the past couple of months. 
The results of inflation targeting 
My  retrospective  begins  in  autumn  1992,  when  the  krona  moved  from  a  fixed  exchange  rate  to  a 
floating rate. It was then important to find a new anchor for monetary policy as rapidly as possible. The 
alternative chosen was inflation targeting. In January 1993 the Riksbank stated in a press release that 
the change in CPI inflation would in future be limited to 2 per cent a year with a tolerance interval of 
± 1 percentage point.  
The  floating  exchange  rate  and  the  inflation  target  constituted  a  drastic  changeover  of  monetary 
policy. There were also a number of problems in the initial stages. The decision to introduce inflation 
targeting was controversial and much criticised in the public debate. Naturally, the Riksbank had no 
experience  of  this  type  of  monetary  policy  regime  and  even  in  countries  where  it  was  already 
established it was a relatively new phenomenon. Moreover, the experiences of Swedish stabilisation 
policy in both the monetary policy and fiscal policy fields during the 1970s and 1980s were less than 
positive. This meant that there was considerable opposition at first and many believed the new regime 
would be short-lived. 
The Riksbank had to balance the need to create confidence in the new, price stability-based regime 
against the need to conduct less restrictive monetary policy to soften the effects of the economic crisis. 
It was a difficult starting point for many reasons, including the fact that public finances were in very 
poor shape. There were also problems with inflation. When the crisis began, the Swedish inflation rate 
fell  significantly,  but  up  to  1995-96  it  was  still  far  above  the  target  level.  The  problems  were 
emphasised  by  developments  in  inflation  expectations.  It  was  not  until  1997  that  expectations 
stabilised around 2 per cent. (Figure 1).

However, around the mid-1990s confidence in economic policy increased. By then, the economy had 
grown for a couple of years, stimulated primarily by the weak krona rate. When drastic measures were 
taken to improve public finances, interest rates fell. Monetary policy contributed to this development by 
consistently fending off all tendencies towards excessively high inflation. It was now possible to have 
more  stable  economic  growth.  During  the  period  1995-2001,  economic  growth  was  an  average  of 
3 per cent, which can be compared with an average of 2.4 per cent during the two previous decades. 
(Figure 2). 
Developments in the labour market also indicate that the measures taken were successful. I recall that 
some economists wanted to interpret the high level of unemployment following the crisis years as an 
indication  that  the  changeover  of  monetary  policy  regime  had  raised  the  economy's  equilibrium 
unemployment level and caused a permanent deterioration in employment. However, once the crisis 
had been overcome and the new policy was established, the labour market situation soon improved. 
Unemployment is currently around 4-5 per cent, which can be compared with figures of above 8 per 
cent in the mid-1990s. However, we still have some way to go to return to what was considered full 
employment prior to the crisis years 1991-93.

All of this has been achieved parallel with a low inflation rate and during the period as a whole inflation 
has been in line with the Riksbank's target. From 1993 to the present day, the increase in CPI inflation 
has averaged 1.9 per cent, while the measure of underlying inflation on which we usually choose to 
base our monetary policy decisions - UND1X - has risen by an average of 2.1 per cent. (Figure 3).

It is not easy to determine what effect the various changes in economic policy have had individually. 
However,  when  taken  as  a  whole  they  have  led  to  an  overall  changeover  in  stabilisation  policy.  A 
clearer allocation of roles has been created in economic policy. The task of monetary policy is to attain

price stability, while fiscal policy is to secure a long-term sustainable development in public finances. 
The government and the Riksdag (parliament) also have the task of increasing the number of those in 
regular employment to 80 per cent. This clear allocation of roles is an important reason behind the 
more successful economic policy over the past ten years. 
The current monetary policy situation 
The international recovery is increasingly evident 
During 2001 there was a downturn in global economic activity, which was partly due to the financial 
setback following on from the stock market bubble in the second half of the 1990s. Resource utilisation 
fell and growth in the OECD area as a whole was 1 per cent that year. The downturn was remarkable 
symmetrical and counteracted by a series of interest rate cuts throughout the western world. Sweden 
was also affected by this downturn, of course, although to a lesser extent than many other countries, 
particularly  because  fiscal  policy  was  more  expansionary,  but  also  due  to  the  krona  being 
undervalued. Resource utilisation was therefore assessed to be higher in Sweden than in many other 
areas, which affected the relative interest rate situation. 
At the beginning of 2002, a wave of optimism began to spread, but it proved short-lived. The main 
reason  for  this  was  the  increasing  geopolitical  unease  concerning  Iraq  and  later  the  war  in  Iraq.  A 
recovery in the global economy was still expected, but at a later date. The weak economic activity led 
to further easing of economic policy during 2003. The United States Federal Reserve, the Riksbank 
and other central banks continued to cut their instrumental rates to all-time low levels. 
Now most indications are that both the Riksbank and other analysts were slightly too pessimistic in 
connection  with  the  Iraq  war,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  view  of  economic  activity  in  the  US 
economy, but also developments in Asia. During the second half of 2003 we have had reason to make 
a further upward revision to our assessments of global economy growth and the picture of the global 
economy as a whole looks good at present.  
The US economy is expected to grow at a slightly more rapid rate than we estimated in the December 
Inflation Report. In the short term, the most significant cause for concern in the US economy is that 
employment  is  still  weak.  Of  course,  the  combination  of  rapid  growth  in  GDP  and  a  weak  labour 
market  mean  that  productivity  growth  is  good,  but  the  dismal  labour  market  situation  could 
nevertheless create uncertainty among households and contribute to subduing consumption.  
However, it is difficult to believe that it would put an end to the upturn we are seeing now. 
There are also signs of an upturn in the euro area now, although the picture is not as clear-cut as in 
the  United  States.  Business  tendency  surveys  for  industry  show  an  increased  optimism,  while 
industrial  production  is  slowly  beginning  to  rise.  Developments  in  Asia,  central  and  eastern  Europe 
also  appear  to  be  slightly  stronger  than  was  previously  assumed.  However,  the  stronger  euro  may 
lead to a slightly slower upturn in the euro area. 
All  in  all,  the  picture  of  international  economic  activity  now  looks  somewhat  brighter  than  we 
anticipated in December. The upturn in economic activity appears to be proceeding roughly as we had 
anticipated it would. 
The Swedish economy has also turned 
We assumed in the December Inflation Report that growth in Sweden would gradually increase during 
the  course  of  2003  and  would  amount  to  1.5  per  cent  for  the  whole  year.  During  2004  and  2005 
growth was expected to be around 2.5 per cent, which is in total a slightly more rapid rate than the 
Riksbank considers sustainable in the long-term without inflation rising. 
The  new  statistics  support  this  scenario,  although  the  picture  is  not  clear-cut.  For  instance,  the 
National Accounts for Q3 indicate an increase in growth compared with earlier quarters, in line with the 
forecast in the Inflation Report.  Other indicators of a recovery are the purchasing managers index and 
the National Institute of Economic Research's business tendency surveys, as well as the fact that retail 
trade  continues  to  show  good  growth.  Counteracting  this  is  the  fact  that  manufacturing  output  was 
weak  during  October  and  November  and  the  number  of  new  orders  declined.  In  addition,  new 
estimates for public finances indicate that public consumption this year may be somewhat weaker than 
4 
 BIS Review 9/2004
was assumed in December. This is mainly connected with the financial situation in local government. 
The local government sector as a whole shows a deficit, which must be redressed over the coming 
years. 
Although the dollar has weakened against the Swedish krona, in terms of the TCW index the krona 
has not appreciated as much. This is mainly because the krona, contrary to many expectations, has 
weakened  against  the  euro.  The  most  recent  National  Accounts  figures  and  foreign  trade  statistics 
also indicate that we have so far been slightly too pessimistic with regard to Swedish exports. 
The  most  evident  cause  for  concern  is  the  labour  market,  which  has  developed  more  weakly  than 
expected,  particularly  towards  the  end  of  2003.  The  strained  financial  situation  in  the  public  sector 
would  seem  to  indicate  weak  employment  growth  for  at  least  the  coming  year,  while  the  economic 
upturn will probably only lead to a relatively small increase in employment in the private sector. There 
is, of course, a risk that the weak labour market will affect households' expectations and consumption 
propensity; a risk that we pointed out already in December and which may have been reinforced. The 
higher the rate of unemployment, the more caution households will probably show when purchasing 
and consuming. This could in turn lead to a risk of lower growth during 2004. 
All in all, the view of the demand situation in Sweden remains essentially the same as in December; 
demand will increase and approach the economy's long-term sustainable level.  
Lower domestic cost pressure 
The relationship between unit labour costs and inflation is usually fairly clear. Thus, when we made a 
downward revision to the figures for unit labour costs in December, it was not entirely insignificant for 
the  inflation  forecast.  The  background  was  primarily  the  signs  we  saw  of  an  improvement  in 
productivity growth, combined with a weaker labour market. I shall return to the subject of productivity 
in more detail in a moment.  
With regard to wage developments, the wage bargaining rounds are currently a central issue. Their 
outcome will have great significance for the rate of wage increase and thereby also to a large extent 
for  inflation  in  coming  years.  It  is  clear  that  the  labour  market  situation  calls  for  moderate  wage 
increases.  Unlike  the  situation  prevailing  during  the  two  previous  bargaining rounds,  unemployment 
has increased and employment has declined recently. Nor are there any labour shortages, other than 
in a few areas. It is also a positive sign that the rate of wage increase has been declining over the past 
year and that the same applied to expected inflation. Given the present low inflation rate, even limited 
nominal  wage  increases  will  lead  to  a  fairly  good  development  in  real  wages,  which  trade  union 
representatives usually emphasise. The nominal wage increases put forward now are lower than those 
of  recent  years.  Meanwhile,  there  is  of  course  always  a  risk  of  shocks  from  the  actual  negotiation 
process. It is not unthinkable that some of the increase in productivity is used as justification for higher 
wage-paying  capacity.  This  could  be  particularly  worrying  if  the  wage  negotiations  assume  that  the 
improvement in productivity is permanent and it later shows a rapid decline. 
At  our  meeting  last  week  we  considered  that  there  was  reason  to  make  a  further  slight  downward 
revision to unit labour cost figures, which in turn had effects on domestic inflationary pressure. The 
labour  market  has  been  weak  and  most  indications  are  that  there  is  reason  to  be  slightly  more 
pessimistic with regard to employment in future. The rate of wage increase could therefore be slightly 
lower than we assumed in December. Meanwhile, productivity growth has continued to be higher than 
expected and we believe that it may rise even further in the near future. Inflation has also been a little 
lower than anticipated. We are expecting a low underlying inflationary pressure in the short term, but 
this will probably increase as economic activity picks up. However, import prices are very important to 
our assessment of future inflation. These have had a significantly subduing effect in recent times, but 
an upward turn appears probable over the coming year. All in all, our assessment is that inflation will 
begin to rise later this spring and gradually approach our target level two years ahead. However, we 
do not believe that this upturn will be particularly dramatic.  
Let  me  emphasise  that  the  changes  that  have  occurred  since  our  December  meeting  are  not 
particularly  great.  They  mainly  entail  some  signs  that  domestic  cost  pressure  could  be  lower  than 
anticipated. As early as December we made some adjustments to our estimates in this respect, but 
the  signs  were  fairly  new  then  and  a  majority  of  the  Executive  Board  preferred  to  await  further 
information that would make the picture clearer. 
Given this, the assessment was that inflation would be slightly lower throughout the forecast period 
than  was  assumed  in  December;  a  conclusion  that  was  not  particularly  sensitive  to  the  choice  of 
BIS Review 9/2004 
 5
inflation  measure.  The  Executive  Board  of  the  Riksbank  therefore  decided  to  cut  the  repo  rate  by 
0.25 percentage points.  
One question that has been raised in the debate is whether it is too late to cut the rate now, given the 
economic recovery. This is not the decisive issue for us. Our method of working means that we base 
our decisions on inflation forecasts. These show that there is scope to cut the rate. In the short term, 
inflation is expected to be much lower than 2 per cent and to cautiously approach the target level only 
1-2 years from now. It would therefore appear that there is plenty of time for an upward adjustment of 
the interest rate in the future if our forecasts indicate this is necessary. The situation would be different 
if  there  was  reason  to  expect  a  rapid  economic  upturn  now,  which  could  threaten  fulfilment  of  the 
inflation  target  in  the  shorter  term.  A  cut  in  the  interest  rate  can  perhaps  also  be  regarded  as  an 
insurance  against  weaker  growth  in  demand;  although  we  have  assumed  a  clear  improvement  in 
economic activity, this is not guaranteed. 
Finally, I should like to comment on an element in the present discussions on monetary policy. Many 
debators have shown a tendency to argue as though it were possible to conduct a perfect, fine-tuning 
policy. I believe it is almost impossible. I think that it is always possible to claim with hindsight that a 
little  bit  more  or  a  little  bit  less  could  have  been  achieved  either  earlier  or  later.  However,  the 
Riksbank's  most  important  contribution  is  not  this  type  of  “fine-tuning”,  but  rather  maintaining  the 
inflation target and upholding confidence in price stability. When we achieve this, we can contribute to 
stabilising real growth in production and employment. But this is not our main objective.  
Productivity growth - an expansion 
Last year, employment in the business sector showed an unexpectedly weak increase, while growth 
was roughly as expected. This was reflected, as I have already mentioned, in the fact that productivity 
growth  was  unusually  good.  The  most  recent  National  Accounts  figures  also  indicate  a  stronger 
productivity growth last year than we assumed in our December assessment. The question is what this 
implies about the future; is what we are seeing a sign of higher productivity growth which will continue 
over a number of years or is it a temporary rise as a result of an improvement in economic activity? Or 
is  the  upturn  perhaps  a  chimera  and  the  result  of  statistical  problems  connected  with,  for  instance, 
difficulties in measuring productivity in certain sectors, such as the telecom industry? 
In  the  United  States,  the  pattern  of  a  weak  growth  in  employment,  combined  with  a  recovery  in 
economic activity has been established for a number of years. According to the National Bureau of 
Economic Research, NBER, the US economy bottomed out in November 2001. Although the size of 
the decline in employment measured varies from one source of statistics to another, the overall picture 
is  still  clear;  employment  has  been  weaker  than  anticipated,  while  economic  growth  has  been 
stronger. This phenomenon is known as jobless growth, or jobless recovery. 
The parallels to the recent developments in Sweden are obvious (Figure 4). Despite the increasingly 
clear signals of stronger economic activity, growth in the labour market is very slow, particularly in the 
business  sector.  Productivity  growth  is  tangible  in  both  the  United  States  and  Sweden,  while  many 
countries  in  Europe  are  still  struggling  with  a  relatively  weak  growth.  However,  one  important 
difference in the comparison between the United States and Sweden is that both the rate of growth 
and the increase have been much more dramatic in the United States. The same applies to the size of 
the decline in employment, which has been much more significant in the United States. This means 
that comparisons between Sweden and the United States should be interpreted with caution.

There is reason to reflect over the explanations that might lie behind a productivity increase of a more 
fundamental nature, similar to that we have seen in the United States in recent years. Personally, I 
have found it helpful to use the events of the late 1990s as a starting point; a period when productivity 
was  also  surprisingly  strong.  The  driving  force  behind  this  development  is  usually  said  to  be 
technological  progress  in  information  and  communications  technology,  which  led  to  productivity 
increases in the IT-producing industry and price falls on IT products. In addition, there was extensive 
investment in IT capital in other industries, also stimulated by favourable price developments, which 
resulted  in  higher  productivity  outside  of  the  IT  sector.   Expressed  in  a  different  way,  productivity 
growth  at  this  stage  was  said  to  be  driven  by  increases  in  total  factor  productivity  within  the 
IT-producing industry and by an increased IT capital intensity in other sectors of the economy. 
Some analysts have pointed to the possibility that the recent productivity increase could be at least 
partly  due  to  IT  capital  now  making  an  efficiency  impact  on  production  even  outside  the  sectors 
producing IT capital, where it has enabled rationalisation of labour and a reduction of the investment 
requirement. This theory thus explains the combination of rapid productivity growth, weak employment 
growth and a slow increase in investment, which has recently characterised both the US and Swedish 
economies. 
So what - apart from the actual developments in productivity, employment and investment - indicates 
that this is the explanation? 
One piece of the puzzle that supports this theory is that the improvements in productivity can scarcely 
be explained merely by business cycle effects. This becomes clear if we study productivity growth in 
the  corresponding  phase  of  the  business  cycle  during  earlier  periods  (Figure  5).  The  measure  of 
economic activity we have chosen is, however, more or less arbitrary and does not entirely correspond 
to the assessment of resource utilisation in the Riksbank's Inflation Report. Nevertheless, this does not 
appear to affect the general conclusion that productivity growth is unusually rapid at present, bearing 
in mind economic activity and could thus be a sign of a sustained change.

Another piece of the puzzle is the development of factor productivity (Figure 6). As I mentioned earlier, 
a more rapid growth in factor productivity at aggregate level could be a sign that IT capital is being 
used more efficiently even outside of the sectors producing IT capital. The best method would be to 
study factor productivity excluding the sectors producing IT capital, but this is not an easy task, due to 
various  statistical  problems.  The  calculations  of  factor  productivity  we  have  made  at  the  Riksbank 
indicate a relatively clear upturn in recent years.

It  is  also  interesting  in  this  context  to  compare  how  developments  in  Sweden  compare  with  other 
countries, particularly the United States. These comparisons are made more difficult by the fact that 
comparable  statistics  are  hard  to  find.  However,  the  statistics  that  are  available  indicate  the  factor 
productivity growth is relatively good in Sweden; much better than in the euro area, for instance.  
To summarise, we can conclude that there has been an upturn in productivity development in recent 
years. Earlier economic patterns are not being repeated entirely. However, it is difficult at present to 
establish what lies behind the upturn. The situation is reminiscent to some extent of that we saw for a 
few years at the end of the 1990s. Then, as now, there was reason for a wait-and-see policy, but not 
to reject outright the idea that what we see is a clear change. In any case, some importance should be 
attached  to  the  new  figures  when  taking  a  policy  stance,  although  we  must  try  even  harder  to 
understand what is happening. 
The monetary policy debate 
Allow me to say a few words in conclusion regarding the recent, lively debate on monetary policy. This 
is because I have received many questions on this subject in recent weeks. However, it is not always 
easy to get a subtle message across when the media debate is so intense. I therefore decided at an 
early  stage  of  the  discussion  to  take  up  this  question  in  greater  depth  here  at  the  Economics 
association, a suitable forum for a penetrating and relatively non-media discussion.  
Before I try to explain my views on some elements of the discussion, I cannot resist pointing out that I 
found the tone of the discussion somewhat surprising. Sweden has come through the recent economic 
slowdown  better  than  many  other  countries.  Personally,  I  also  felt  much  greater  concern  over 
economic developments and monetary policy at the end of spring and beginning of summer 2003 than 
I have done in recent months. The reason is simple. At the end of last spring, the inflation rate was still 
high.  Although  we  believed  it  would  fall,  there  was  a  clear  risk  that  it  could  become  entrenched. 
Meanwhile, there was considerable uncertainty over international economic activity; would there be a 
turnaround and if so, when? This could mean we are forced to make difficult judgements. For instance, 
we might be forced to raise the interest rate even if economic activity weakened. Now the situation is 
fundamentally  much  better,  with  declining  inflationary  pressure  combined  with  increasing  growth. 
Nevertheless, the debate is much tougher. Why, one might ask. 
What can be said about the discussion itself? Let me begin by pointing out the obvious; it is good to 
have  a  vivid,  lively  discussion  of  monetary  policy.  A  central  bank  that  has  been  given  clear, 
independent  responsibility  for  monetary  policy  has  good  reason  to  be  open  about  the  bases  for  its 
decisions.  This  facilitates  a  more  exact  discussion  of  monetary  policy  as  well  as  assessment 
afterwards. An open debate forces and encourages us to improve our arguments and to continuously 
develop methods and assessments, in other words to become better. This is all for the good and in 
actual fact one of the most important motives behind the openness we have striven to achieve over 
the past ten years.  
Various assessments of the situation have been made recently, both by external analysts and within 
the Riksbank. For instance, in December two of my colleagues believed we should cut the repo rate. 
Essentially,  I  think  that  the  debate has  been  factual  in  that  the  demands  for rate  cuts have  usually 
been based on assessments of future inflation differing from those made by the Riksbank. It is only in 
exceptional cases that these exhortations appear to have been based on inflation targeting as such 
being questioned. 
However, this does not mean that all elements of the discussion have been good and clear-cut. One 
issue that has led to questions and been discussed considerably is that some leading politicians have 
actively  involved  themselves  in  the  debate  and  on  repeated  occasions  expressed  very  specific 
requirements for immediate interest rate cuts and in one case even a change in our meeting schedule. 
The question is whether this is appropriate or even wise. 
This is not a new issue, and it is one I have faced on numerous occasions since I began work at the 
Riksbank.  My  point  of  view  has  always  been  that  we  have  a  statutory  task  to  perform.  We  shall 
perform this independently and to the best of our abilities. The law is crystal clear; we are not allowed 
to accept political instructions or even advice. Moreover, even before the new legislation was in place 
we had chosen to design a clear framework for our work. Our target of maintaining price stability has 
been specified as an inflation rate of 2 per cent. We have also “tied” our actions in other ways, such as 
publishing  forecasts  and  systematically  following  particular  working  methods.  This  enables  those 
outside of the bank to assess our actions and motives and thereby to be sure that we are not taking

account of inappropriate considerations. Given this, over the years I have had a fairly relaxed attitude 
to politicians' interference in the general debate. 
However, this issue has further implications than such. Over the Christmas holidays I read a book by 
the  former  US  Treasury  Secretary  Robert  Rubin.1  He  takes  up  this  issue  and  motivates  why  he 
strongly advised President Clinton against holding public opinions on monetary policy, advice followed 
by the President. According to Rubin, there is always a risk that the bond market will be affected if 
there  is  the  slightest  suspicion  that  the central  banks'  actions  are governed  by political  pressure.2  I 
think that the fact that he - with his decades of experience on Wall Street - brings up this argument and 
that he does so despite the widespread respect enjoyed by Greenspan's Federal Reserve, shows that 
the  argument  cannot  be  waved  aside.   One  could  object  that  the  Riksbank's  legal  independence  is 
greater than that of the Federal Reserve. On the other hand, the low-inflation regime is relatively new 
in  Sweden  and  our  market  is  also  small  and  influenced  to  a  large  degree  by  external  agents,  who 
often lack in-depth knowledge of how our system works.  
At  present,  the  economic  and  political  developments  in  Sweden  are  so  stable  that  political 
manoeuvring of the type we have seen hardly has any effect on the markets, although some concern 
has  been  expressed  by  foreign  analysts.  However,  politicians  who  enter  the  discussion  with  strong 
opinions  in  a  stable  situation  should  probably  reflect  over  how  they  might  act  in  future  in  more 
problematic situations.   
Rubin  also  points  out  that  the  president  was  able,  by  showing  a  clear  respect  for  the  Federal 
Reserve's independence, to increase his own credibility and build-up confidence in economic policy in 
the United States and in the functioning of the financial markets. This is a view I can sympathise with. 
The question is then how we in Sweden should act to ensure that confidence in our total economic 
policy is as great as possible. Essentially, this of course means doing the right things. In our case, 
ensuring  price  stability  in  accordance  with  our  own  definition.  However,  I  believe  that  the  ways  in 
which the authorities responsible for fiscal policy and monetary policy cooperate can also play a role 
here. In this aspect I can see clear advantages in the interplay between government and central bank 
in the United States and the United Kingdom. Maintaining mutual respect for one another's tasks, they 
have  a  close  cooperation  to  conduct  an  overall  policy  that  will  benefit  their  country  as  much  as 
possible. This is a desirable form of cooperation, particularly for small countries and I believe that we 
in  Sweden  have  come  a  long  way  towards  this  since  the  mid-1990s.  It  would  be  a  negative 
development if the pattern were broken and we instead slipped into a form of interplay similar to that in 
continental  Europe,  where  national  finance  ministers  blame  their  problems  on  the  ECB  and  where 
sharp words are regularly aimed in the opposite direction. 
Thank you.

criticism of the Federal Reserve by politicians as “a fool's game”, which is at best ineffective and at worst counterproductive.
