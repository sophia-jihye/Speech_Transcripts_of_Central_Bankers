Svein Gjedrem: Economic perspectives 
Annual  address  by  Mr  Svein  Gjedrem,  Governor  of  Norges  Bank  (Central  Bank  of  Norway),  at  the 
meeting of the Supervisory Council of Norges Bank, Oslo, 19 February 2004. 
 Introduction 
There  is  now  growth  in  the  Norwegian  economy.  Oil  prices  are  high.  Capacity  utilisation  in  the 
mainland economy is at the level prevailing in the mid-1990s. Wage growth is slowing. White-collar 
workers have lowered their wage demands, and there are prospects of a moderate main settlement 
this spring - the first in eight years. The value of the krone is on a par with the mid-1990 level. The 
interest rate level is in line with the level among our trading partners. 
In that respect, there is equilibrium in the Norwegian economy at present. 
But it is fragile. 
The international division of labour is shifting, and when faced with major changes it is a disadvantage 
for Norwegian business and industry that costs are high. 
Inflation is very low. 
Short-term interest rates abroad have been unusually low over the past 2½ years, and there are no 
prospects of a considerable increase in the near term even if the world economy is expanding. Last 
year, interest rates abroad acted as a magnet on Norwegian interest rates. We now have the lowest 
nominal interest rate level recorded in decades. 
Norwegian households are optimistic and are borrowing and investing in housing and property. 
This stands in contrast to corporate behaviour. Businesses are rationalising and earnings are on the 
rise, but they are still investing and borrowing on a limited scale. 
The upturn is still not entirely self-sustained.

Cross-border capital flows have increased considerably in recent decades. Bond markets have moved 
more in tandem, particularly since the mid-1990s. This also applies to equity markets.

Investors are increasingly spreading their investments across countries. They are diversifying risk, and 
seeking high returns. In parallel, governments, banks and companies are issuing more debt externally.

Currency trading has increased markedly since the 1980s. This trend was reversed when the number 
of  currencies  was  reduced  owing  to  the  introduction  of  the  euro.  Large  trading  volumes  enhance 
market  liquidity.  The  growth  in  currency  trading  is  ascribable  to  an  increase  in  portfolio  investment, 
higher foreign direct investment and growth in world trade. 
The forward exchange and options market have expanded in recent years. A deeper market reduces 
transaction  costs,  and  it  is  easier  to  find  counterparties.  This  has  provided  companies  with  greater 
scope  for  hedging  against  foreign  exchange  risk.  The  use  of  instruments  that  reduce  the  risk 
associated with a floating krone is also increasing in Norway. 
A considerably larger portion of credit in other countries is now channelled via the bond market. Less 
risk is being accumulated in banking systems. The development of new markets and instruments, for 
example credit derivatives, has also led to a broader risk spread than earlier. 
The improved diversification of risk is probably one of the reasons that world financial markets have 
coped with  the stock  market  decline and  the  accounting scandals with  limited  damage  to  the wider 
economy. This is probably one reason why the downturn following the stock market decline in 2000 
was considerably less pronounced than earlier downturns. 
The  new  instruments  spread  risk,  but  do  not  eliminate  it.  Financial  markets  have  become  highly 
complex.  This  alone  entails  an  operational  risk,  which  is  a  challenge  to  participants  and  the 
supervisory authorities.

A shift in the international division of labour 
Increased trade promotes growth and lays a basis for prosperity. A number of Asian countries have 
experienced strong, export-led growth - Japan from the 1950s and several countries in Southeast Asia 
from the 1960s.

In recent years, China has become an important player in international trade, and the country is now 
the world’s fourth largest trade nation. The Asian economies and the rest of the world have become 
more integrated. 
Technological  advances  and  a  sharp  fall  in  prices  in  the  IT  and  telecommunications  sectors  have 
exposed a number of services that were previously sheltered to competition from low-cost countries. 
Indian companies  service  three  million customer  telephones  for  companies  in the  US  and  the UK  - 
daily.  European  airlines  are  transferring  ticket  settlement  to  India.  US  companies  are  outsourcing 
accounting services to India. Analytical activity in investment banks and development divisions in ITC 
companies  are  also  being  moved  to  India.  Norwegian  engineering  companies  are  buying  cheap 
engineering services in India and China. 
EU enlargement this spring, with ten new members, is also influencing the division of labour in Europe.

The advances in Asian economies have generally relied on an abundant supply of cheap labour, but 
wages have gradually increased in step with productivity gains. A higher income level paves the way 
for higher imports.

Today’s globalisation has a historical parallel. 
In  the  period  preceding World  War  I,  the  world  experienced  a period  of  strong  growth  in trade  and 
cross-border capital flows. There were few political barriers and major technological advances fostered 
growth  in  trade.  Prosperity  increased.  But  this  period  was  interrupted,  and  in  the  interwar  period 
protectionism  gained  ground,  with  trade  barriers  and  a  contraction  in  international  trade.  This  was 
combined  with  an  economic  recession.  In  the  post-war  period,  trade  barriers  have  gradually  been 
scaled  back.  Trade  picked  up  already  in  the  1950s,  and  since  the  1980s  financial  markets  have 
become evermore interwoven.

 BIS Review 11/2004
Implications for the Norwegian economy 
Intensified competition from Japanese and Korean shipyards had serious implications for Norwegian 
shipbuilding  in  the  1970s  and  1980s.  However,  Japan  has  also  become  an  important  market  for 
Norwegian  products.  From  the  considerable  deficits  of  earlier  years,  trade  in  traditional  goods  with 
Japan has moved into near balance. 
Strong growth in Asia is probably one of the prominent factors contributing to high oil prices in spite of 
low growth in the OECD area in recent years. China accounted for close to 50 per cent of the growth 
in world oil consumption in 2002 and 2003. Trade in Asia has stimulated Norwegian shipping. 
The Chinese economy could continue to expand at a brisk pace for a longer period, which would open 
a large market that can also be entered by Norwegian enterprises. Norwegian exports to China have 
increased, but are still limited. 
Over several years, enterprises in Central European countries have been a source of competition for 
Norwegian  jobs.  Integration  is  also  opening  new  markets  and  providing  new  sources  of  income  for 
Norwegian enterprises. At the same time, tender requirements and the freedom of establishment have 
increased the competition facing Norwegian industries that were previously sheltered.

A steadily larger share of Norway’s consumer goods imports come from China and Central European 
countries. Growth in imports from China was provided with an additional impetus after China became 
a member of the World Trade Organization in 2001. Imports from Eastern Europe have also continued 
to grow. 
There  are  many  economic  agents  in  Norway  that  are  benefiting  from  globalisation.  Consumers  are 
enjoying lower prices for goods and services. Input prices have fallen and companies can sell their 
products in new markets. But there are also costs. Norwegian businesses and jobs may lose in the 
competition. 
The challenge lies in moving idle resources to new business activities. This requires adaptability and a 
sound cost policy. 
Monetary policy 
The operational target of monetary policy, as defined by the Government, is inflation of 2½ per cent 
over time. The target is symmetrical - it is just as important to avoid an inflation rate that is too low as 
an  inflation  rate  that  is  too  high.  The  inflation  target  provides  economic  agents  with  an  anchor  for 
inflation expectations.

History shows that there is no long-term trade-off between lower unemployment or stronger economic 
growth and higher inflation. We witnessed this in the 1980s when growth was low and inflation high. 
The task of monetary policy is to provide a nominal anchor. Low and stable inflation is such an anchor. 
Why is a little inflation an advantage? 
There are several reasons why it is an advantage for inflation to be higher than zero. 
The structure  of  the  economy  is  in  flux.  Demand  for  labour with  different  qualifications  is  changing. 
This requires changes in relative wages. There are rigidities in nominal wage growth. Nominal wages 
do  not  readily  fall.  With  some  inflation,  relative  wages  can  change  without  a  fall  in  nominal  wages. 
There may also be rigidities in the pricing of goods and services. Some degree of inflation will thus oil 
the economic machinery. 
In periods, inflation and economic growth will be low. It is then appropriate for real interest rates to be 
low,  or  even  negative.  Nominal  interest  rates  cannot  be  set  below  zero.  If  inflation  becomes 
entrenched at a low level or near zero, the interest rate will be less effective as an instrument. 
There  are  different  ways  of  measuring  inflation.  The  consumer  price  index  tends  to  overestimate 
actual  inflation.  The  most  important  source  of  measurement  errors  is  probably  the  difficulty  of 
distinguishing  between changes  in  the quality  and  price  of  goods.  In  other  countries,  findings show 
that the consumer price index overestimates actual inflation to the order of ½-1 per cent. 
The conduct of monetary policy 
Norges Bank normally sets the interest rate with a view to attaining an inflation rate of 2½ per cent two 
years ahead. If demand for goods and services is high and there is a shortage of labour, there will 
normally be prospects of higher inflation. When the interest rate is raised, demand is dampened and 
inflation is kept in check. If demand is low and unemployment rises, there will be prospects of lower 
inflation. The interest rate will then be lowered. The inflation target thus represents a framework, not 
an obstacle, for monetary policy to contribute to stability in output and employment. 
In the long run, output is determined by the supply of labour and capital and adaptability, but in the 
short and medium term monetary policy can also have an impact on the real economy. 
Norges  Bank  operates  a  flexible  inflation  targeting  regime,  so  that  weight  is  given  to  variability  in 
output and employment and inflation. The economy grows over time. Output will in periods lie below 
trend growth and in others above trend. Stabilising output growth means that one seeks to maintain 
actual output near trend.

Monetary policy credibility 
Expectations play an important role in price and wage formation. Expectations concerning inflation and 
economic  stability  are  of  crucial  importance  for  the  foreign  exchange  market.  Inflation  expectations 
also influence wage demands and pricing in the business sector. 
With  confidence  in  monetary  policy,  expected  inflation  in  the  long  term  will  be  close  to  the  inflation 
target. This alone contributes to stabilising inflation. 
Surveys indicate that enterprises, the social partners and other economic agents expect inflation to be 
2½  per  cent  over  time.  Financial  market  participants  also  expect  that  inflation  will  be  2½  per  cent 
ahead, as implied by long-term bond yields. 
A flexible exchange rate 
The krone exchange rate is an important channel for monetary policy. 
The  krone  fluctuates.  This  is  not  surprising  because  other  countries’  currencies  also  fluctuate.  The 
krone  exchange  rate  is  the  price  of  our  currency  measured  in  a  foreign  currency.  Developments  in 
other  countries  are  just  as  important  for  the  krone  as  developments  in  the  Norwegian  economy. 
Capital flows freely and flows can change rapidly. This can spill over to exchange rates and interest 
rates as well as output and employment. 
A structural feature of open economies like the Norwegian economy - with a national currency - is that 
the exchange rate fluctuates. 
The Norwegian krone does not stand out as particularly unstable. On the contrary, in countries like 
Sweden, the UK, Switzerland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the exchange rate fluctuates just 
as much - or more - than in Norway. 
There is a cost involved for businesses in hedging against fluctuations in the krone. A krone that is 
stable - but too strong - also entails costs in the form of low activity. Similarly, a krone that is stable - 
but weak - is a source of high inflation. 
Petroleum  revenues  generally  provide  substantial,  but  uneven  currency  inflows  into  Norway.  The 
currency flows might have resulted in a strong krone and large variations in the exchange rate. This 
tendency  is  countered  when  the  annual  use  of  petroleum  revenues  over  the  central  government 
budget  is  predictable  and  independent  of  annual  revenue  inflows,  and  the  remainder  is  invested 
abroad. The capital outflow through the Petroleum Fund contributes to both curbing the appreciation of 
the krone and maintaining its stability.

Norges Bank has not defined an exchange rate target. Nevertheless, developments in the krone are of 
considerable importance to interest-rate setting because exchange rate developments have an impact 
on inflation and output. When there are prospects of moderate economic activity, low wage growth and 
low inflation, Norges Bank will reduce the interest rate. This will normally result in a depreciation of the 
krone.  Prices  for  imported  goods  and  services  will  increase.  A  weaker  krone  strengthens  the 
competitiveness  of  Norwegian  enterprises  and  indirectly  leads  to  higher  output,  employment  and 
inflation. 
Themes in foreign exchange markets shift. In periods, investor focus on stock returns feeds through to 
exchange  rate  movements.  During  periods  of  political  and  economic  unrest,  investors  may  choose 
individual currencies as a safe haven - often the Swiss franc. In the autumn of 2002, the Norwegian 
krone was probably also perceived as a safe haven. Wide fluctuations between major currencies have 
a tendency to result in a weaker krone. In the past 12-18 months, developments in the interest rate 
differential between Norway and other countries appear to have had a particularly marked impact on 
our currency. Norwegian interest rates have been pushed down to the level prevailing abroad.

 BIS Review 11/2004
In  the  autumn  of  2003,  the  krone  showed  a  tendency  to  appreciate  against  the  euro.  This  partly 
reflected lowered market expectations concerning an interest rate increase abroad and expectations 
that  interest  rates  might  rise  earlier  in  Norway  than  in  other  countries.  At  the  same  time,  the  euro 
appreciated in relation to other currencies. Changes in the krone resulted in an unintended tightening 
of monetary policy. This trend was reversed in December owing to a reduction in interest rates and low 
inflation figures. The interest rate reduction was probably of considerable importance as it eliminated 
the excess return on NOK investments. Today, the krone is at a level that is more consistent with the 
objective of promoting stability in output and employment. The weaker krone will contribute to a rise in 
inflation from a level that is too low. 
Normally,  Norges  Bank  will  not  intervene  in  the  foreign  exchange  market  in  order  to  influence  the 
exchange rate. Exchange market intervention, whether it be purchases or sales of foreign exchange, 
is not an appropriate instrument for influencing the krone over a longer period. We do not wish to act in 
a  way  that  may  trigger  a  game  situation  in  the  foreign  exchange  market.  Foreign  exchange 
intervention rather than a change in the interest rate may give ambiguous signals to foreign exchange 
operators and a game situation may arise.

Although the krone may fluctuate in the short term, it will generally stabilise over time. When inflation 
has  been  higher  in  Norway  than  among  our  trading  partners  for  a  longer  period,  the  krone  has 
generally  depreciated.  When  inflation in  Norway  is expected  to  be  broadly  in  line  with  that  of  other 
countries, the exchange rate will normally also return to its normal range following periods when the 
krone has been particularly strong or particularly weak. This provides a basis for stable exchange rate 
expectations. 
The advantage of a flexible exchange rate is perhaps most evident when the economy is sluggish. If 
the krone were to remain at a level that is too strong, nominal wages would have to remain unchanged 
over  a  longer  period  or  fall  in  order  to  bolster  companies  and  jobs.  This  only  occurs  when 
unemployment is very high. With a flexible exchange rate, a depreciation of the krone can also boost 
competitiveness. A flexible exchange rate can reduce fluctuations in employment and output. 
Empirical studies do not provide any evidence that floating exchange rates have reduced growth in 
industrial countries. Rather, they suggest that industrial countries with floating exchange rates have 
fared well, and often better, than countries with an exchange rate target. A precondition is that there is 
an economic policy framework so that inflation does not spin out of control. 
Economic developments and prospects 
External cyclical developments and events have had considerable implications for developments in the 
Norwegian economy.

The  US  fuelled  the  international  upswing  in  the  1990s,  with  strong  growth  in  private  consumption, 
rising equity prices and a high level of investment. Inflation was low because productivity increased. 
In Continental Europe, the upturn started later and was weaker. Capacity utilisation in Germany and 
France was low through most of the 1990s.

The international upturn came to a halt in 2000. The bubbles in the equity markets burst. Many years 
of  high  investment  and  rising  unemployment  led  to  excess  capacity.  The  terrorist  attacks  on 
11 September 2001 put a new damper on economic activity. From the summer of 2002 to the spring of 
2003,  a  highly  extraordinary  accumulation  of  negative  events  in  the  global  community  -  accounting 
scandals,  fear  of  terror,  war  and  disease  -  put  a  brake  on  growth.  US  interest  rates,  which  were 
sharply reduced at the beginning of the downturn, have subsequently been reduced further. Interest 
rates have also remained low in the euro area. 
There are now clear signs that the global economy has passed the trough. However, while the outlook 
is brighter, price inflation is still low and interest rates are being kept unusually low. Economic growth 
is high again in the US. Employment is rising, but there is still excess production capacity and very low

inflation. It may take some time before interest rates are increased substantially in the US. Growth in 
Asia is solid, but a global rise in interest rates is unlikely to start there. 
Inflation is higher in the euro area than in the US and approximately in line with the objective defined 
by  the  European  Central  Bank.  In  the  euro  area,  however,  capacity  utilisation  is  very  low, 
unemployment high and the outlook for growth is weaker. Against this background, it will probably also 
take time before interest rates rise markedly in the euro area.

The imbalances in world trade represent a particular risk. The US is running a substantial trade deficit, 
which was financed for a number of years by private capital flows to the US business sector. The flows 
have subsided and led to a sharp fall in the US dollar at the same time as the euro has appreciated. 
Through purchases of US government securities, Asian countries have thus far kept their currencies 
stable against the US dollar. 
The US federal budget deficit is an important source of the imbalances in world trade. It appears that it 
will take time before the deficit is reduced to a considerable extent. This entails a risk that the dollar 
will  depreciate  further  and  that  US  long-term  government  bond  yields  will  move  up.  Growth  in 
Continental Europe, which is highly reliant on impetus from exports, may weaken markedly if the dollar 
continues to fall.

Norway, like other countries, experienced a period of strong expansion in the 1990s. The expansion in 
Norway  lasted  considerably  longer  than  in  other  countries.  In  1998,  the  economy  shifted  from  an 
upturn  with  high  growth  rates  to  an  expansion  with  lower  growth  but  low  unemployment,  labour 
shortages in many sectors and strong growth in labour costs. 
Wage developments culminated in the spring of 2002 and the expansion was reversed in the second 
half  of  the  year.  Growth  came  to  a  halt  and  employment  fell.  A  number  of  factors  triggered  this 
development. Higher wage costs weakened the purchasing power of public entities. Global stagnation 
had a dampening impact on Norwegian exports. In Norway, the interest rate was kept high after the 
wage settlement and a persistent, unexpected low level of interest rates abroad resulted in a strong 
krone. The sharp rise in electricity prices last winter also affected the domestic economy.

Consumer  price  inflation  in  Norway  declined  sharply  through  2003.  A  number  of  factors  appear  to 
have contributed to the decline. 
The appreciation of the krone through 2002 pushed down import price inflation.

The change in trade patterns has made a considerable contribution to the sharp decline in prices for 
clothing,  shoes  and  audiovisual  equipment.  Rapid  technological  advances  have  also  pushed  down 
prices for audiovisual equipment. 
In Norway, competition has probably increased in the retail industry and other service sectors in recent 
years. Initially, heightened competition affects companies’ profit margins. But enterprises will respond 
by reducing their costs. This will occur in part in the individual enterprise, but subcontractors will also 
be  required  to  reduce  their  prices  and enhance  efficiency.  Therefore,  increased  competition  usually 
triggers higher productivity growth in the economy. Low inflation may therefore be matched by growth 
in productivity.

The  cyclical  downturn  last  winter,  low  wage  increases  last  year,  fiscal  discipline,  an  unexpected 
decline in inflation and prospects of low inflation have resulted in a considerable easing of monetary 
policy. The interest rate has been reduced by 5 percentage points and is now approximately the same 
as among our trading partners. The krone has depreciated by about 12 per cent over the past year, 
and has returned to the level prevailing in the summer of 2001 and is in line with the average for the 
1990s.

Monetary policy is expansionary now. This is reflected in low after-tax real interest rates. A long-term 
real  yield  on  10-year  bonds  can  be  estimated  at  about  1  per  cent.  We  have  adjusted  the  nominal 
interest rate for expected inflation. The short-term real interest rate is estimated at 1½ per cent. We 
have then adjusted the figure for actual inflation. The fall in nominal interest rates in 2003 has also 
reduced  household  net  interest  expenses.  This  has  increased  household  purchasing  power 
considerably.

 BIS Review 11/2004
The fall in the value of the krone over the past year has strengthened the Norwegian business sector. 
The business sector is, however, still feeling the effects of a sharp rise in labour costs over a period of 
several  years.  Relative  labour  costs  measured  in  a  common  currency  are  in  line  with  the  level 
prevailing  in  1990,  but  approximately  10  per  cent  higher  than  in  the  mid-1990s.  The  internationally 
exposed  sector  has  been  scaled  back.  Those  companies  that  are  currently  operating  may  be  in  a 
better position to bear the high wage level. Nevertheless, costs may limit activity and employment. 
Growth in the Norwegian economy picked up again through the summer of 2003. In the period ahead, 
solid growth in household income, subdued consumer price inflation and low interest rates will provide 
the  conditions  for  high  growth  in  private  consumption.  There  is  optimism  in  the  building  and 
construction  sector.  High  petroleum  investment  is  also  supporting  activity  while  mainland  business 
investment has been low for a long period. 
The  number  of  persons  employed  began  to  increase  in  the  summer  of  2003  and  unemployment 
stabilised. 
An economic turnaround has occurred, with a soft landing after the long period of high cost inflation in 
Norway and a low level of activity in other countries. 
But inflation is too low. 
As mentioned, there are three main factors that have contributed to this. 
First,  the  global  downturn  had  considerable  implications  for  the  impact  of  interest-rate  setting  in 
Norway.  A  strong  krone  contributed  to  the  decline  in  inflation.  The  krone  has  now  returned  to  its 
previous level so that the effect will be reversed. 
Second, low inflation in other countries and rapid changes in the international division of labour have 
resulted  in  a  fall  in  prices  for  imported  goods  and services,  even  when  measured  in  terms  of  what 
Norwegian importers pay in foreign currency. 
Third, intensified domestic competition also appears to have exerted downward pressure on prices. 
As a result of both changes in the international division of labour and increased domestic competition, 
there is idle labour and available real capital in Norway. We cannot rule out that adjustments will be 
made over a period of time and that these adjustments will encompass a large portion of the domestic 
economy.  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  the  level  of  output  that  is  consistent  with  stable  inflation  will 
increase. 
Inflation  will  remain  low  in  2004.  However,  the  easing  of  monetary  policy  will  gradually  push  up 
inflation. As mentioned, it may take some time before interest rates in other countries are increased to 
a considerable extent. We have seen that in periods, the krone is heavily influenced by changes in the 
difference  between  interest  rates  at  home  and  abroad,  and  we  must  take  this  into  account  when 
setting interest rates. Themes in foreign exchange markets may shift, however. The impact of interest 
rate changes on the exchange rate may be less pronounced. 
When inflation gradually moves up from a very low level, there will be a basis for gradually moving 
towards a more normal short-term interest rate level in Norway. This may counter the emergence of 
excessive pressures on domestic resources in the medium term. Interest rate developments in other 
countries may also have considerable impact on the krone and hence on Norwegian interest rates. 
When inflation is low - and as low as it is now - it is appropriate to place considerable emphasis on 
pushing  up  inflation.  Therefore,  we  are  particularly  vigilant  with  regard  to  consumer  price 
developments. 
Financial stability 
Developments in real economic variables are mirrored in credit markets. 
In recent years, household income has shown solid growth, and household confidence has been high. 
However, corporate earnings have been low, and until recently enterprises have primarily focused on 
enhancing efficiency. 
Credit  developments  are  giving  ambiguous  signals  to  our  interest-rate  setting. Growth  in  household 
borrowing is high, but enterprises are reducing debt. The change in the breakdown of credit may have 
been amplified by banks’ increased eagerness to extend credit to households after a period of losses

GDP.

Developments in credit to enterprises shadow developments in their investments. Low credit growth 
indicates that mainland business investment has not yet picked up. 
Household debt has increased sharply since 1999. Developments in debt in the 1990s may partly be 
interpreted as a delayed adaptation to the deregulation of the housing and credit markets in the 1980s 
after many households experienced financial difficulties following the relaxation. 
Moreover, there now seems to be a tendency towards investing in property and incurring loans at a 
more mature age so that younger generations not only inherit dwellings, but debt as well. Both debt 
and wealth are on the rise for these more mature age groups. 
Household credit demand is closely linked to developments in the housing market. 
House  prices  have  risen  by  an  average  of  around  9  per  cent  over  the  past  10  years.  High  and 
persistent  house  price  inflation  can  contribute  to  holding  up  credit  growth  even  after  prices  have 
levelled off. Since only a portion of the housing stock is sold each year, some dwellings will be sold at 
16 
 BIS Review 11/2004
a higher price than they were last sold for a long period. This is one of the reasons why growth in 
credit to households has remained high even after house price inflation moderated in 2002 and into 
2003.

Home-owners who have seen the value of their dwellings rise have the possibility of taking up new 
mortgage-secured  loans.  They  free  up  a  portion  of their  home  equity  value  to  finance  consumption 
and other investments. 
It is easiest to sell dwellings in the largest cities and some specific areas are particularly attractive. 
Residential property is now a fairly liquid and attractive investment. 
Price developments in the housing market are characterised by the fact that there is little change in the 
housing stock from one year to the next. As a result, higher demand for housing will in the first round 
translate into higher prices. Housing prices fluctuate more than prices for goods and services, where 
supply can be rapidly adapted. 
A persistently high rate of increase in house prices can in isolation engender expectations of a further 
rise and can thus prove to be self-reinforcing for a period.

Norwegian households generally finance their mortgages at an interest rate that follows the short-term 
money market rate. Floating interest rates tend to vary widely over time. 
The interest rate level is very low at present, and long-term investments cannot rely on this interest 
rate spanning the life of a housing loan. According to money market expectations, the interest rate will 
eventually stabilise around 5½ per cent. This is consistent with an inflation target of 2½ per cent and a 
long-term real interest rate in line with the level abroad. This interest rate, with a mark-up for banks’ 
margins, provides a more realistic expression of the interest rate level that will apply over the loan’s life 
than the floating interest rate prevailing today. 
It may prove to be particularly challenging for borrowers to assess their debt-servicing capacity over 
time at a time when the interest rate is abnormally low. Such a low interest rate also places particular 
demands on banks in assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers. But experience has shown that the 
underlying cause of loans defaults can be overly optimistic assessments on the part of both the lender 
and borrower. 
House prices and developments in household credit influence consumption and housing investment. 
We seek to take account of these indirect effects in interest-rate setting. 
A sharp rise in asset prices and debt accumulation may pose a risk to economic stability. With a view 
to mitigating this risk, it will be appropriate in some situations to apply a somewhat longer-than-normal 
time horizon than two years to attain the inflation target. 
However,  at  present  debt  accumulation  is  high  only  in  the  household  sector.  Enterprises  are 
accumulating little debt. House prices are rising, but non-residential property prices are stable. 
The debt to income ratio is now in line with the level recorded at the beginning of the 1990s. 
We have limited scope for restraining structural changes that occur when households increase their 
debt over several years to invest in housing and other property and assets. An interest rate that would 
effectively  restrain  these  structural  adjustments  would  also  have  an  adverse  impact  on  output  and 
employment. 
The interest rate can be used to reduce credit demand. At present - with low interest rates abroad and 
a close link between domestic interest rates and the krone - a tighter monetary policy would restrain 
credit demand primarily because job security would be reduced. 
A flexible inflation targeting regime reduces the possibility of exposing households to a double shock 
in the form of higher unemployment and higher interest rates, as was the case prior to the banking 
crisis  in  the  beginning  of  the  1990s.  If  the  economy  is  exposed  to  disturbances  that  lead  to  higher 
unemployment, inflation will normally decline and interest rates be lowered.

Conclusion 
To sum up: 
The operational target of monetary policy is inflation of close to 2½ per cent over time. Norges Bank 
operates  a  flexible  inflation  targeting  regime,  so  that  weight  is  given  to  variability  in  output  and 
employment and inflation. 
Norges Bank has not defined an exchange rate target. A flexible exchange rate enhances stability in 
output and employment. 
A structural feature of open economies like the Norwegian economy - with a national currency - is that 
the exchange rate fluctuates. The forward exchange and options markets have provided companies 
with greater scope for hedging against foreign exchange risk. 
An economic turnaround has occurred, with a soft landing after the long period of high cost inflation in 
Norway and low activity in the global economy. 
But inflation is too low. 
The  appreciation  of  the  krone  through  2002,  a  change  in  trade  patterns  and  external  economic 
developments have contributed to low import price inflation. Domestic competition also appears to be 
exerting downward pressure on inflation. 
As a result of both changes in the international division of labour and increased domestic competition, 
there is idle labour and available real capital in Norway. Thus, it is possible that the level of output that 
is consistent with stable inflation will increase. 
Credit developments are giving ambiguous signals to our interest-rate setting. The interest rate can be 
used to reduce credit demand. At present - with low interest rates abroad and a close link between 
domestic interest rates and the krone - a tighter monetary policy will restrain credit demand primarily 
because job security would be reduced. 
When  inflation  gradually  moves  up  from  a  very  low  level,  we  can  begin  to  move  towards  a  more 
normal  short-term  interest  rate  level  in  Norway.  This  may  counter  the  emergence  of  excessive 
pressures on domestic resources in the medium term. Interest rate developments in other countries 
may also have a considerable impact on the krone and hence on interest rates in Norway. 
When inflation is low - and as low as it is now - it is appropriate to place considerable emphasis on 
pushing  up  inflation.  Therefore,  we  are  particularly  vigilant  with  regard  to  consumer  price 
developments.
