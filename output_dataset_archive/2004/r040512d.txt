Caleb M Fundanga: Recent economic developments in Zambia 
Speech by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, on the occasion of the monthly 
meeting with chief executive officers of commercial banks, Bank of Zambia, Lusaka, 2 April 2004.

Recent economic developments  
 Introduction  
This brief reviews monetary, economic and financial sector developments during February 2004.  
Monetary developments 
• 
During February 2004 monetary policy was focused on reducing monthly overall inflation rate 
to  1.6%.  Net  strong  revenue  inflows  complemented  with  primary  auctions  of  Government 
securities helped to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity.  
Inflation  
• 
    Monthly  overall  inflation  slowed  down  by  1.5  percentage  points  to  1.1%  in  February  2004 
from 2.6% in January. This was 0.5 percentage points lower than the projection of 1.6% for 
February 2004. The decrease in the monthly overall inflation rate was attributed to the slow 
down in food and non-food inflation rates to 0.9% and 1.4% in the month under review from 
2.3% and 2.9% in January 2004, respectively.  
The slow down in food inflation was attributed to continued ample supply of food items in the 
market while the drop in non-food inflation was largely due to price declines in rental and fuel 
prices  as  well  as  in  prices  of  transport  and  communications,  recreational  and  educational 
services.  
The annual overall inflation rate fell to 16.8% in February 2004 from 17.4% in January 2004. 
This was 0.2 percentage points below the end-February 2004 inflation projection of 17.0%. 
The annual overall inflation at 16.8% was also 6.1 percentage points below the end-February 
2003 inflation outturn of 22.9%.  
Broad money  
• 
Preliminary  data  indicate  that  broad  money  (M3)1  growth  slowed  down  to  1.4%  (8.4%  in 
December  2003)  to  K4,530.7  billion  in  January  2004  from  K4,467.9  billion  in  December 
2003.  This  growth  was  1.0  percentage  points  lower  than  the  2.4%  recorded  during  the 
corresponding period in 2003, but was 0.4 percentage points above the programmed money 
supply growth of 1.0% for the month.  
The growth in broad money during the period under review was largely on account of the 
increase  in  net  foreign  assets  of  the  banking  system,  which  increased  by  2.9%  to 
K2,364.9 billion.  
Year-on-year broad money growth on the other hand declined by 1.2 percentage points to 
22.2% in January 2004 from 23.4% in December 2003.  
Domestic credit  
• 
Preliminary  data  show  that  growth  in  domestic  credit  slowed  down  to  2.3%  (3.1%  in 
December  2003)  to  K4,310.9  billion  in  January  2004  from  K4,215.1  billion  in  December 
                                                      
1  Broad  money  is  here  defined  to  include  currency  outside  banks,  demand  deposits  at  Bank  of  Zambia  and  commercial 
banks, local currency savings and time deposits, and foreign currency deposits.

 2003. This was mainly attributed to the decline in borrowing by the public sector to negative 
4.0% from 22.5%. In addition, there was a slow down in the growth of Government, private 
and non-bank financial institutions sectors borrowings to 2.3%, 3.1% and 10.3% in January 
2004  from  3.1%,  3.4%  and  14.5%,  respectively.  On  a  year-on-year  basis,  domestic  credit 
slowed down by 7.5 percentage points to 40.0%.  
Following  the  reduction  in  the  statutory  reserve  ratios  on  commercial  banks’  Kwacha  and 
foreign  currency  deposits  to  14.0%  from  17.5%  on  31st  October  2003,  commercial  banks’ 
total  loans  and  advances  increased  by  6.6%  between  October  2003  and  January  2004  in 
nominal  terms.  Sectors  to  which  most  of  this  lending  went  with  respective  percentage 
increases were: agriculture (12.2%), mining (36.3%) and electricity, gas, water and energy 
(316.9%).  However,  credit  to  the  manufacturing  sector  fell  by  18.8%  while  lending  to  the 
transport, storage and communications sector declined by 9.6%.  
Interest rates  
Yield rates on Treasury bills and Government bonds  
• 
High  liquidity  levels,  coupled  with  Government’s  restraint  on  further  borrowings  from  the 
market, continued to exert downward pressure on yield rates. The weighted average yield 
rate for all Treasury bills fell by 3.7 percentage points to 15.5 percent in February. This was 
driven by declines in the individual yield rates of all Treasury bills. 
Similarly,  yield  rates  on  Government  bonds  further  declined,  supported  by  reduced 
Government borrowing and abundance of liquidity in the market. Thus, the weighted average 
yield  rate  for  all  Government  bonds  fell  to  17.5  percent  in  February  from  22.7 percent  in 
January.  
Commercial banks’ nominal interest rates  
• 
Consistent  with  the  trend  in  yield  rates  on  Government  securities,  all  commercial  banks’ 
nominal interest rates declined. The weighted average lending base rate (WALBR) and the 
average lending rate (ALR) declined to 33.7% and 41.3% in February 2004 from 36.2% and 
43.9% in January 2003, respectively. The average savings rate for amounts above K100,000 
and  the  30-day  deposit  rate  for  amounts  of  over  K20  million  dropped  to  7.0%  and  11.5% 
from 7.2% and 15.1% in January 2004, respectively.  
Real interest rates  
• 
All  real  interest  rates  declined  due  to  the  decrease  in  the  rate  of  inflation  and  the  fall  in 
nominal interest rates. The real WATBR fell by 3.9  percentage points to negative 2.2% in 
February  from  1.7%  in  January  2004.  The  real  Weighted  Average  Treasury  bill  Rate 
(WALBR) declined by 1.9 percentage points to 16.9% from 18.8%. Similarly, the real 30-day 
deposit rate for amounts above K20 million fell by 3.0 percentage points to negative 5.3%. 
However, the real ASR for amounts exceeding K100,000 increased by 0.4 percentage points 
to negative 9.8%.  
Foreign exchange market  
• 
During  the  review  period,  the  Kwacha  remained  relatively  stable.  It  gained  0.2 percent 
against the US dollar to an average of K4,763.99 per US dollar in February. However, the 
Kwacha  weakened  against  other  major  traded  currencies,  depreciating  by  2.7 percent 
against  the  pound  sterling  to  an  average  of  K8,879.12  per  British  pound  and  1.7 percent 
against the South African rand to an average of K706.87 per rand. Further, the Kwacha lost 
0.5 percent against the euro, moving to an average of K6,025.64 per euro.  
The continued relative stability in the Kwacha vis-à-vis other currencies was partly explained 
by the well-functioning broad based interbank foreign exchange system, which has thus far 
led to an efficient flow of information in the foreign exchange market since its inception in 
July 2003. In addition, the fall in the value of merchandise imports, coupled with the rise in 
the value of exports during the month of January 2004, contributed to the observed relative 
stability in the foreign exchange market in February 2004.

 Real sector developments  
Agriculture  
• 
As at 29th February 2004, the Food Reserve Agency (FRA) had purchased a cumulative total 
of  54,773.15 metric  tonnes  (mt)  of  maize  compared  with  54,598.57  metric  tonnes  (mt)  of 
maize  purchases  at  the  end  of  January  2004.  The  highest  amount  purchased  was  from 
Eastern Province, 16,052.55 mt followed by 11,935.0 mt from Southern Province. The rest of 
the  purchases  were  from  Central  (9,026.15  mt),  Northern  (8,824.75  mt),  North-western 
(3,100.15 mt),  Luapula  (2,561.85  mt),  Lusaka  (2,381.50  mt),  Western  (498.80 mt)  and 
Copperbelt (392.40 mt) provinces.  
As at 29th February 2004, major milling companies in the country had an estimated maize 
stock  of  58,620.0 mt  compared  with  74,224.0  mt  recorded  at  end-January  2004.  Of  this, 
Lusaka  Province  was  holding  28,670.0  mt,  Copperbelt  (16,200.0  mt),  Southern  Province 
(6,650.0 mt),  Central  Province  (6,000.0  mt),  Northern  Province  (1,000.0 mt),  and  Eastern 
Province (1,000.0 mt).  
Millers’ average purchase price for maize rose by about 7% to K35,967.0 per 50kg bag in 
February  2004  from  K33,599.50  per  50kg  bag  in  January  2004,  mainly  due  to  seasonal 
movements, as the 2003/2004 consumption period is about to come to an end. 
Total copper production declined by 4.8% to 31,764.00 mt in January 2004 from 33,369 mt in 
December  2003.  Copper  output  fell  as  a  result  of  reduced  production  at  all  major  mines 
arising from seasonal factors in the rainy season.  
Similarly, cobalt output declined by 6.8% to 171.50 mt from 184.00 mt in the previous month. 
There was no cobalt production at one of the major mines during the period under review on 
account of higher processing charges, given low quantities of cobalt that were available for 
processing. The downward movement in production was a result of seasonal considerations 
as the mines become waterlogged during the rainy season.

international passenger movements. International arrivals at these airports declined by 3.0% 
to17,733 from 18,279 in January 2004. At 18,637, departures were 2.9% above the 18,104 
recorded in the previous month.  
Of the total international arrivals, Livingstone and Mfuwe Airports, which are the major tourist 
destinations, accounted for 3,530 and 102, respectively. This was an improvement from the 
3,110  and  36  recorded  the  previous  month,  respectively.  The  increase  in  international 
arrivals at these two airports was mainly on account of continued marketing in the tourism 
sector. Livingstone posted 3,782 departures during the reviewed month compared to 3,424, 
while Mfuwe recorded 106 departures against 31 in January 2004.

 External sector developments  
• 
Preliminary data indicate that the country’s trade deficit narrowed to minus US $19.8 million 
in January 2004 from minus US $45.3 million in December 2003, mainly due to a decrease 
in the value of imports.

    Total  merchandise  imports  declined  by  15.1%  to  $121.0  million  in  January  2004  from 
US $142.5 million in December 2003. The fall in imports was mainly attributed to the decline 
in  the  imports  of  food  items  (40%),  fertilisers  (19%),  chemicals  (21%),  plastic  and  rubber 
products (40%), iron and steel items (48.6%), nuclear reactors and equipment (31%), and 
electrical machinery and equipment (52%).  
On the other hand, merchandise exports increased by 4.1% to US $101.2 million in January 
2004 from US $97.2 million in December 2003. The increase in copper export receipts was 
on account of the rise in both the volume of copper exports by 2.1% to 30,076 metric tons in 
January 2004 from 29,449 metric tons in December 2003, and an increase in realised prices 
by 5.5% to 96 cents per pound in January 2004 from 91 cents per pound in December 2003.  
However,  cobalt  export  receipts  decreased  following  the  decline  in  the  sales  volume  by 
42.9%  to  131.8 metric  tons  in  January  from  230.9  metric  tons  in  December  2003.  Cobalt 
realised prices, on the other hand, increased by 46.6% to US $22.08 per pound in January 
2004 from US $15.06 in December 2003.  
Non-metal export earnings increased by 1.6% to US $31.0 million in January 2004 compared 
with US $30.4 million realised in December 2003. The major non-traditional export items that 
contributed  to  the  rise  in  export  receipts  in  January  2004  were  burley  tobacco,  cement, 
cotton lint and sugar.

Developments in the financial sector  
Banking sector  
Overview of financial performance of the banking sector  
• 
    to  K639,660 million 
increased  by  3.2% 
industry’s  net  worth  position 
On  the  basis  of  capital  adequacy,  asset  quality,  earnings  performance  and  liquidity,  the 
overall  financial  condition  and  performance  of  the  banking  industry  during  the  month  of 
February was satisfactory.  
The 
from 
K619,955 million  in  January.  The  sector  also  continued  to  be  adequately  capitalised.  All 
banks met their minimum regulatory capital requirements in the month under review.  
The  asset  quality  in  the  month  under  review  was  satisfactory,  with  the  level  of  interest 
earning  assets  accounting  for  77%  of  total  assets  compared  to  76%  for  the  preceding 
month.  
The  sector’s income  before  tax  amounted  to  K48,206  million  compared  to  K23,897 million 
recorded in January. The 100% increase in profit before tax was mainly on account of the 
following:  interest  income,  which  increased  by  K58,497  million  or  93%  compared  to 
K11,813 million or 82% increase in interest expenses. Additionally, foreign exchange income 
in  gains  and  commissions  increased  by  100%  from  K30,291  million  to  K60,857 million. 
Non-interest  expenses  increased  to  K  104,869  million  compared  to  K52,916 million  in 
January 2004. However, the ratio of non-interest expenses to total net income remained at 
69%.  
The banking sector’s liquidity position was satisfactory with the liquidity ratio (liquid assets to 
total  deposits  and  short-term  liabilities)  remaining  constant  at  75%.  All  banks  met  the 
prudential  minimum  ratio  of  50%.  The  deposit  concentration  at  28%  from  31%  in  January 
was also well spread. Total deposits to total assets dropped to 71% from 73% in January.  
Money laundering draft directives  
• 
On  18  March  2004,  the  BoZ  held  a  consultative  workshop  with  financial  institutions,  to 
discuss the draft Money Laundering Directives. Valuable contributions to clarify or strengthen 
the  draft  Directives  at  this  well  attended  workshop  were  received.  The  BoZ  is  now  in  the 
process of finalising the said directives.

ESAF/SADC Bank Supervision Application project  
• 
The implementation of the BSA project has reached an advanced stage. It is expected that 
the  implementation  will  be  completed  by  end  of  April.  The  consultants  are  finalising  the 
returns  that  will  be  used  for  submission  of  data.  The  finalised  returns,  in  the  form  of  a 
workbook will be circulated to all the banks. In the meantime, the BoZ would like to thank the 
five  banks  (Barclays  Bank,  Stanbic  Bank,  Cavmont  Capital  Bank,  Investrust  Bank  and 
African Banking Corporation) that submitted test data for finalising the returns. The BoZ will 
be calling on the banks to take part in the testing of the electronic submission of data.  
Non-bank financial institutions sector  
• 
The  performance  of  the  non-bank  financial  institutions  sector  was  generally  satisfactory 
although  some  institutions  were  still  faced  with  financial  distress.  The  Bank  of  Zambia  is 
addressing  the  problems  of  distressed  financial  institutions  within  the  framework  of  the 
Financial Sector Development Plan.

Announcements and areas of concern  
Update on the Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP)  
• 
The BoZ is seeking comments from the public and other stakeholders on the FSDP which 
was  placed  on  the  BoZ  website  on  6  February  2004.  The  last  day  for  submission  of 
comments is 31 March 2004. A National Forum to discuss the FSDP is scheduled for April 
2004. Further details on the Forum will be advised in due course.  
Update on the microfinance regulations  
• 
The  draft  microfinance  regulations,  which  are  aimed  at  providing  a  legal  framework  for 
regulation and supervision of microfinance institutions, are currently being reviewed by the 
BoZ  and  are  scheduled  to  be  submitted  to  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  National  Planning 
during the second quarter of 2004.  
Polymer notes  
• 
As most of you must have heard, through the media, there are public concerns about some 
features fading on the polymer banknotes of K500 and K1,000. While we have also noticed a 
number of them, we wish to inform you that fading is a definite and expected feature of these 
notes as they approach the end of their useful life. However, we also feel that being a new 
concept,  the  notes  could  still  be  subjected  to  undue  stress  testing  due  to  public  curiosity. 
However, we are also not ruling out premature wearing of the notes. We are therefore doing 
everything possible to ensure that subsequent consignments do not suffer similar setbacks. 
In the meantime, we wish to make an earnest appeal to all the banks to assist the Bank of 
Zambia in ensuring that faded notes are quickly taken out of circulation, in the same way as 
soiled banknotes have been handled in the past. The Bank of Zambia is also going to set up 
mechanisms for enhancing the process and pace of siphoning faded notes from circulation.  
International Fund for Agricultural Development Mission  
• 
An  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)  Mission  was  in  the  country  to 
solicit comments on the Rural Finance Programme Inception Report of November 2003 on 
the development of rural finance. The major findings were that the Inception Report provided 
the basis for the provision of rural finance, however, it was noted that the report was limited 
in scope and was too focused on creating an enabling environment for the provision of rural 
finance. In addition, the report lacked concrete initiatives for rural finance. In view of this, the 
Mission proposed the following interventions: 
• 
• 
Support of community based financial institutions;  
Rural banking;  
BIS Review 27/2004 
 5
Credit facility for contract farming operations;  
Innovation and outreach facility; and  
Policy, legislative and management support.  
• 
• 
• 
As  a  way  forward,  the  Mission  agreed  to  complete  a  draft  formulation  report  by  end-April 
2004, hold a stakeholders’ workshop by end-May 2004 and finalise the formulation report by 
end-June 2004. The programme appraisal would be conducted by end-September 2004. 
 AFRACA Workshop  
• 
A workshop was held in South Africa under the auspices of AFRACA. A number of issues 
came up but a particular one we would like to encourage in our market is the linked banking. 
This involves commercial banks entering into arrangements with other institutions, such as, 
microfinance institutions to extend some form of banking services even to outlying areas. We 
feel that linked banking provides an opportunity to improve the intermediation role that banks 
play  in  an  economy.  Our  Non-Bank  Financial  Institutions  Department  will  be  happy  to 
provide  more  information  on  this  and  other  innovative  approaches  to  provision  of  rural 
financial services discussed at the said workshop.  
Update on ZIPSS-RTGS implementation  
• 
The  Project  ZIPSS-RTGS  implementation  team  has  successfully  undertaken  the  following 
activities within the project time frame: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Development of RTGS policy/position papers;  
Delivery, installation of BOZ RTGS hardware and software;  
Conducting of training for BOZ business and IT staff;  
Conducting of both Business and Technical Functional Tests of BOZ RTGS; and  
Inspection  of  Commercial  Banks  readiness  in  terms  of  hardware  and  SWIFT 
connectivity.  
 It  is  important  to  note  that  these  activities  are  critical  for  the  successful  delivery  of  the 
systems  within  the  agreed  time  and  budget.  Commercial  Banks  are  therefore  urged  to 
ensure  that  their  banks  are  ready  for  the  next  phase  which  directly  affects  them.  The 
Implementation Team has put in extra efforts to assist commercial banks to ensure that they 
are  ready  within  the  agreed  time  frames.  Given  the  importance  of  the  RTGS  system, 
commercial  banks  must  ensure  that  whatever  solution  they  go  for  does  not  compromise 
reliability, availability, speed and security of the system.  
On-site examination of commercial bank’s readiness  
• 
The  Bank  of Zambia  on-site  examination  for commercial  banks’ readiness commenced  as 
planned on 22 March 2004. Preliminary indications are that the majority of the banks were 
ready  for  the  installation  of  the  RTGS  application  software  on  29 March  2004.  The 
installation of the software is being done in a phased manner, i.e. on first-ready-first installed 
basis. This is to ensure that the project schedule is not held back unnecessarily.  
It  is  also  important  to  remind  all  banks  that  every  bank  is  required  to  comply  with  the 
minimum 
the  Perago  RTGS  client 
configuration and SWIFT connectivity prior to the installation of the application software. This 
will  enable  timely  installation  of  the  Perago  RTGS  application  software,  bilateral  key 
exchange (BKE) for SWIFT connectivity and commencement of the pilot project.

 RTGS training for commercial bank staff  
• 
The RTGS training facilities have been installed, tested and are currently running in the Bank 
of  Zambia  In-Service  Training  Centre.  Training  for  the  Bank  of  Zambia  staff  has  been 
finalised.  Training  for  commercial  bank  staff  is  scheduled  to  commence  on  16 April  2004. 
This training will involve Perago RTGS Server Applications Technical Operations Training for 
6 
 BIS Review 27/2004
 for 
the  IT  area  staff  and  Perago  RTGS  Entry  training  for  the  business  area  staff.  This 
programme  covers 
transaction  capturers,  authorisers,  and  systems 
training 
administrators and operators. 
As  earlier  communicated  to  commercial  banks,  a  number  of  training  sessions  have  been 
devised because the training facilities can only accommodate 12 participants at a time. In 
this regard, a month has been provided for commercial banks’ training ending 5 May 2004. 
All  banks  are  reminded  to  ensure  that  they  submit  names  of  nominated  officers  to  the 
Assistant  Director - Payment  Systems  as  soon  as  possible  to  enable  the  training  to  start 
according to schedule.  
Piloting of the RTGS system  
• 
The  piloting  of  the  system  is  scheduled  to  commence  on  27  April  2004.  It  is  therefore 
cardinal that the entire industry moves in unison on this project. As indicated to commercial 
banks at the last meeting, the training of both Bank of Zambia and commercial banks staff 
and the execution of the pilot project have been arranged close to each other to enable the 
quick  and  effective  transfer  of  acquired  skills  to  staff’s  “desks”  or  operational  areas. 
Therefore, the need for all banks to move at the same pace cannot be over emphasised.  
Counterfeits  
• 
We would like to alert you all that there are people trying to encash counterfeit notes and as 
banks you are the most vulnerable. It is therefore incumbent upon all of your members of 
staff  to  be  vigilant  when  handling  incoming  cash.  The  incidence  of  the  counterfeits  is 
suspected to affect other locations beyond Lusaka as such even your outlying areas must be 
alerted. You should urgently report such cases to the Zambia Police Service.  
Bank of Zambia and government participation in foreign exchange market  
• 
As discussed during the meeting in Ndola and consistent with the code of conduct for the 
broad based interbank system, we would like to reiterate the fact that Bank of Zambia is a 
participant in the market like all other players. As such the Bank’s participation should not be 
seen as extraordinary but as part of the process. Equally, Government participation should 
be treated in a similar manner. 
In addition, a number of issues were raised in the workshop regarding the operations of the 
foreign exchange market and a report has been circulated to that effect. In this regard, the 
Bank of Zambia will soon write to the Bankers Association of Zambia (BAZ) outlining those 
issues that require action by all concerned parties.  
 Use of EDP funds  
• 
It has come to our attention that some intermediaries of the EDP funds are not utilizing the 
funds  according  to  the  agreed  rules.  In  some  instances,  the  intermediaries  are  not 
on-lending  the  funds  to  their  clients.  Such  practices  if  allowed  to  continue  will  defeat  the 
purpose  of  the  efforts  aimed  at  creating  a  sustainable  source  of  wholesale  medium-  to 
long-term funds in our market. We wish to urge all of you to adhere to the established rules, 
failure  to  which  those  institutions  engaged  in  unacceptable  practices  may  not  be  able  to 
secure such funding in the future thereby denying their clients critical project funding.  
ZIBAC meeting  
• 
A second meeting for the Zambia International Business Advisory Council (ZIBAC), was held 
in Livingstone from 5 to 7 March 2004. During the meeting, ZIBAC members and the private 
sector, represented by the Zambia Business Forum (ZBF), applauded the Bank of Zambia 
and the Government for achieving relative stability in the macroeconomic environment. This 
is  reflected  in  the  relative  stability  in  the  exchange  rate  and  the  downward  movement  in 
interest rates for which the weighted Treasury bill yield rate entered the single-digit region by 
early  March  2004.  This  trend  is  due  to,  among  other  factors,  the  reduced  Government 
borrowing from the financial system and indeed your cooperation as banks, especially those

that have responded by appreciable adjustments in their base rates. The other aspect was 
that of inflation, which slowed down to 17.2% in December 2003 from 26.7% in December 
2002 and the further fall to 16.8% by February 2004. Accordingly, calls were made for the 
Bank  and  the  Government  to  continue  with  the  efforts  to  stabilise  the  macroeconomic 
environment, since stability is one major consideration in investors’ decisions for investment 
destinations.  
While ZIBAC and ZBF members commended commercial banks for positively responding to the Bank 
of  Zambia  and  Government  actions  by  reducing  lending  rates,  they  pointed  out  that  the  cost  of 
borrowing  for  the  productive  private  sector  was  still  high  and  that  there  was  need  to  further  lower 
lending  rates  so  as  to  make  loans  affordable.  In  addition,  low  lending  rates  would  improve  the 
investment climate in the country.  
Outlook  
4. 
The  March  2004,  inflation  pressures  were  anticipated  to  slow  down.  Factors  for  this  anticipation 
include the following:  
• 
Given that the supply of fresh foodstuffs from the 2003/2004 agricultural season had started, 
inflationary pressures were likely to ease. Coupled with the lifting of the fishing ban in March 
2004 and expected increase in the supply of fish on the market, these factors were expected 
to dampen food inflationary pressures;  
The slow growth in broad money in January 2004 and the decline in average reserve money 
at  end-February  2004  were  expected  to  have  a  dampening  effect  on  non-food  inflation  in 
March 2004;  
The exchange rate of the Kwacha against other currencies was expected to remain relatively 
stable  on  account  of  improved  foreign  exchange  supply  on  the  market  arising  from 
favourable export receipts due to higher metal prices and increased non-traditional earnings 
especially of sugar, cotton lint, burley tobacco and cement; and  
Government  expenditure  was  expected  to  be  within  the  targeted  levels  and  this  was 
expected  to  contribute  to  ensuring  that  net  domestic  financing  of  Government  from  the 
banking  system  would  remain  within  the  projected  ceiling  and  thereby  contribute  to  the 
anticipated drop in inflation.  
   In view of these expectations, the Bank of Zambia will continue to implement appropriate monetary 
policy aimed at containing the growth in reserve money and broad money within the projections.  
As part of the outlook, there are two important events that will be forthcoming. These are:  
The upcoming IMF mission  
• 
We wish to inform you that the IMF mission will be in the country during mid-April to assess 
progress  made  against  the  Staff  Monitored  Programme  (SMP)  with  a  view  to  consider 
Zambia’s return to a PRGF. It is therefore, our hope that nothing will be done in the market to 
reverse  the  many  successes  that  we  have  achieved  thus  far  because  we  all  need  the 
programme which will not only lead to the country reaching the much anticipated completion 
point  under  the  enhanced  HIPC  initiative,  but  also  bring  along  other  benefits,  such  as, 
increased supply of foreign exchange in the economy.  
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)  
• 
In addition, a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Zambia was recently approved by the 
World Bank Board. Here too a lot of praise was given to our achievements but with caution 
as  more  work  needs  to  be  done  in  our  economic  programme.  The  approval  of  CAS  for 
Zambia means that some substantial funding will be released beginning soon and will spread 
over  a  relatively  stretched  period.  This  will  help  ease  the  situation  given  the  resource 
constraints that the country is facing, especially to fund capital and related projects.
