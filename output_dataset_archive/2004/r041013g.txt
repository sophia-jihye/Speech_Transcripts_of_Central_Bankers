Arnold Schilder: Dynamics in accounting and auditing in relation to banking 
supervision 
Speech  by  Professor  Arnold  Schilder, Chairman  of  the  BCBS  Accounting  Task  Force  and Executie 
Director of the Governing Board of the Netherlands Bank, at the Plenary Session of the International 
Conference of Banking Supervisors, Madrid, 23 September 2004. 
The following speaking points should be read in conjunction with the related PowerPoint presentation. These points have been 
organised under the relevant slide numbers and headings. 
 Good  morning,  everyone!  It  is  a  privilege  and  a  pleasure  to  be  asked  to  introduce  today’s  panel 
discussions  on  the  important  changes  taking  place  in  accounting  and  auditing  and  their  impact  on 
banking supervision. 
“Dynamics in accounting and auditing in relation to banking supervision” 
1. 
It strikes me just how appropriate the title of my presentation truly is.  
Yesterday’s  discussions  on  the  new  capital  framework  confirmed  to  me  that  dynamics  exist 
everywhere and are not confined just to accounting and auditing matters. And last evening many of us 
were able to attend the wonderful and very dynamic Zarzuela performance, for which we thank our 
hosts from the Bank of Spain.  
This morning, we have just heard Malcolm Knight speak about the remarkable and equally dynamic 
evolution taking place in accounting, fuelled by convergence trends within banking, between banking 
and insurance and across global markets. I’m pleased that my remarks today will echo many of these 
same thoughts, and that the topics chosen for our workshops will focus on some of the key issues we 
supervisors need to think about as we and the institutions we regulate prepare for these changes.  
The interaction: an overview 
2. 
This slide gives an overview of the different components that feed into and are supported by financial 
information.  My  presentation  has  been  built  around  this  overview  and  will  look  at  these  various 
interactions one by one. 
The role of sound accounting and adequate disclosure in the creation of useful information for markets 
and  investors  is  obvious.  Sound  auditing  standards  applied  properly  by  auditors  who  also  maintain 
high  standards  of  professional  conduct  also  contribute  to  market  and  investor  confidence.  In  turn, 
these disciplines are also responsive to the changing needs of market, investors and other external 
stakeholders. 
The remaining elements on this slide also interact with the financial information process. For example, 
yesterday  Chairman  Caruana  mentioned 
importance  of  alignment  between  sound  risk 
management  and  financial  information.  On  the  one  hand,  financial  information  generated  from  risk 
management activity should be provided to all external users of financial statements, but at the same 
time that information also provides important feedback to risk managers about their own performance. 
On the other hand, the requirements of banking supervisors also shape what information is created 
about banking risks and risk management activities and will tend to influence bank behaviour. Such 
information is also an important tool used by supervisors to evaluate institutional and systemic safety 
and soundness.  
And while our key focus at this conference is banking risk, we should not forget what Malcolm Knight 
said this morning about the growing similarities between banking and insurance, and, for us, the need 
to be able to supervise, or jointly supervise, financial services conglomerates.

Under accounting, I will look first at accounting and disclosure - what are the drivers and trends? Then, 
accounting and supervision - where they converge, and, unfortunately, where they diverge. Then I will 
look at the challenges this situation creates for banking supervisors and the need for regulatory action. 
Under  auditing,  I’m  going  to  look  at  recent  developments  first,  then  specific  enhancements  to  the 
quality of the auditing process that have resulted from these developments, and finally what could be 
done to improve the process even further. 
Accounting & disclosure; drivers & trends 
4. 
First, developments in accounting and disclosure.  
There is no question that trends in this area have been driven by a demand for greater transparency in 
financial reporting. One important development is the IASB’s recently published Exposure Draft #7 on 
Financial Instruments Disclosures. This draft proposes several sound principles to guide what should 
appear in published financial statements.  
Increasingly, international accounting standards also support broader and more sensitive recognition 
of risks in several ways. First, more risks are moving onto the balance sheet than ever before. Second, 
IAS 39’s increased use of fair value measurement is helping to quantify various types of risk that may 
not have been identified or fully understood under the traditional cost-based model. Finally, the drive 
toward enhanced financial risk disclosures in the new ED 7 proposals should improve discussion of 
any risks that do not appear in the balance sheet and of how financial risks are being managed. It’s 
clear that Pillar 3 disclosures were looked at by the IASB during development of the current exposure 
draft and we’re happy about that. 
Finally, we need to recognise that one major objective behind the current development of international 
standards is a desire by countries and markets for a single, high quality financial reporting model that 
will be widely acceptable and broadly applied. One important additional consideration is the potential 
for convergence between IFRS and US GAAP. 
Points of convergence with banking supervision 
5. 
There are strong parallels between these drivers and trends and those underlying Basel II. 
As I noted on the previous slide, the IASB’s work on disclosure of financial instruments - first in IAS 32, 
but especially in its new ED 7 proposals - has been inspired by concepts and guidance first proposed 
in Basel’s Pillar 3. 
Second, one of Basel II’s starting points has been the need to develop more refined approaches to the 
measurement  of  risks.  This  means  allowing  banks  to  make  greater  use  of  their  own  risk  modelling 
approaches where supervisors are satisfied that these models are sound and will be used responsibly.  
Third,  supervisors  have  become  very  conscious  of  the  need  to  harmonise  their  principles  and 
practices  at  both  a  global  and  regional  level.  Basel’s  Accord  Implementation  and  Core  Principles 
Liaison  Groups  are  focused  on  this  objective  at  the  international  level.  A  good  example  of  similar 
activity at a regional level is the work of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors. 
So  far,  so  good.  But  now  we’re  going  to  look  at  where  standard  setting  and  banking  supervision 
diverge, and what this means for banking supervisors. 
Points of divergence from banking supervision (1) 
6. 
As this slide suggests, accounting is increasingly moving toward a neutral picture of enterprises and 
their risks. This may appeal to the markets and investors, but it is not consistent with the perspective 
that  banking  supervisors  must  adopt  in  order  to  look  at  longer-term  safety  and  soundness  issues. 
Malcolm Knight suggested this morning that this is due to different “DNA”, and he could be right. 
This  drive  toward  neutrality  is  reflected  in  several  ways.  I  mentioned  increasing  use  of  fair  value 
accounting in a previous slide, and while this approach does have some benefits it is not without a few 
concerns. 
2 
 BIS Review 56/2004
For  example,  “prudence”,  as  a  supervisor  would  understand  it,  will  no  longer  play  the  same  role  in 
valuing financial assets and liabilities. “Fair values” won’t discriminate between gains and losses, or, in 
the case of gains, between those that are realised in cash and those that are not. “Prudent” valuations 
won’t be accepted any longer if they are materially different from those produced under a fair value 
scenario.  And,  as  noted  in  other  workshops,  “rainy  day”  provisions  that  neutralise  effects  of  the 
economic cycle won’t be permitted. 
As  a  result,  changes  to  current  accounting  practice  will  also  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  quality  of 
accounting capital and on how supervisors assess that capital for regulatory purposes.  
Points of divergence from banking supervision (2) 
7. 
Accounting  standards  operate  under  a  different  time  horizon  than  capital  standards  and  have  their 
greatest impact in the area of loan losses.  
Under  IFRS  and  US  GAAP,  allowances  for  incurred  losses  must  be  based  on  the  occurrence  of  a 
given loss event rather than historical trend information alone. For some banks at least, this means 
that allowances at any point in time are unlikely to be sufficient to meet full EL requirements although, 
amazingly, we did see some excesses during our QIS work.  
Also, dynamic provisioning approaches that provide “through the cycle” accounting are unlikely to be 
acceptable. This means banks must take the credit risk premium charged to cover expected losses to 
income, even if the related losses cannot be recognised until a much later date. 
Points of divergence from banking supervision (3) 
8. 
Standard setters also don’t appear to give much consideration to the financial stability implications of 
their proposals. First, they seem indifferent to how much additional volatility could be created in banks’ 
financial statements as a result of the wider use of fair values. Second, they do not share the concerns 
of supervisors and many others that fair valuing changes in own credit risk is inappropriate, especially 
when this means recognising gains based on deterioration of one’s own credit. Even if supervisors can 
make appropriate adjustments to these items for regulatory capital purposes, how users will react to 
what is published in the financial statements is a worry for both banks and banking supervisors. 
Finally, supervisors are deeply concerned with the apparent disconnect between how banks manage 
portfolios  of  risk  and  the  models  produced  by  standard  setters  to  capture  these  activities.  The  key 
issue is that international standards apply fair value to whole instruments rather than the underlying 
risks, and to single contracts rather than portfolios, and we believe that standard setters need help to 
better  understand  the  business  of  banking.  As  Chairman  Caruana  noted,  good  accounting  should 
support sound risk management practices. Certainly the two pictures should not be in conflict. 
Additional challenges for banking supervision 
9. 
If  these  issues  were  not  enough,  supervisors  must  grapple  with  more  subjective  balance  sheet 
measurements  and  what  this  means  for  the  reliability  of  financial  statement  values.  In  this  case, 
subjectivity  takes  two  forms:  the  need  to  use  models  for  instruments  that  do  not  have  active  local 
markets, and the potential for an enterprise to choose from wide ranges of possible “fair values” in 
pricing a given instrument. 
Also, financial statement disclosure is moving toward a generic approach for all types of entities. This 
is most evident in the new ED 7 proposals on disclosure that are intended to replace bank-specific 
disclosures found in IAS 30. The key question for supervisors is how assets and liabilities of banks 
should be classified on the balance sheet - by measurement classification, or by type of product? 
Need for regulatory action: a mixed blessing (1) 
10. 
Despite these many challenges, banking supervisors are positioned to compensate through regulatory 
means. They can issue supervisory guidance (for example, on provisioning, and on various aspects of 
fair value accounting) at any one or all of the Basel, regional and local levels. They are able to apply 
prudential filters to the accounting results, such as was done through two recent press releases on 
BIS Review 56/2004 
 3
suggested capital treatments of certain IFRS items. Developing supervisory reporting and disclosure 
frameworks,  for  example  the  current  CEBS  initiative)  can  also  help  to  re-establish  consistent  and 
comparable information for supervisory use. 
Need for regulatory action: a mixed blessing (2) 
11. 
At the same time, these additional measures create additional administrative burdens for banks, and 
supervisors are very sensitive to the need to keep this additional burden to a minimum.  
Also,  as  the  Basel  Committee  supports  the  use  of  sound  IFRS  for  supervisory  as  well  as  public 
reporting,  applying  prudential  filters  to  these  standards  could  create  the  perception  that  we  do  not 
have full confidence in the quality of IFRS-based financial information.  
Now, let’s turn to auditing trends and issues. 
Significant recent developments in auditing (1) 
12. 
Recent  accounting  scandals  -  Enron,  Worldcom,  Parmalat  and  others  -  have  raised  fundamental 
questions concerning auditor responsibility, auditor independence and audit quality. Since that time, 
auditing  standard  setters  and  others  have  been  hard  at  work  on  improvements  needed  to  restore 
public confidence in the profession.  
For  example,  the  U.S.  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  and  revision  of  the  EU’s  Eighth  Directive  have  been 
designed  to  address  several  important  elements  related  to  standards  development  and  approval, 
auditor  independence  and  standards  compliance.  Also,  the  international  profession  is  dealing 
proactively  with  a  number of  initiatives designed to promote  improved  audit  quality  and  much more 
transparent quality control processes. These important developments are very similar to approaches 
found in Pillars 2 and 3 of the revised framework.  
Auditors are also revising the scope of their work in ways that speak to many of the Basel Committee’s 
concerns.  For  example,  strengthening  the  responsibility  of  a  lead  auditor  in  group  audits  should  be 
helpful to home and host supervisors involved with the same financial services group. Also, enlarging 
the scope of audit responsibilities to address internal controls and fraud should support supervisory 
assessments of how “know your customer” risk is being managed. 
Significant recent developments in auditing (2) 
13. 
Another means to improve audit quality has emerged in the form of auditor oversight.  
Internationally,  a  number  of  international  regulatory  organisations  (the  World  Bank,  the  Financial 
Stability Forum, IOSCO, the Basel Committee, the IAIS and the European Union) have worked with 
the international auditing profession to agree on the creation of a Public Interest Oversight Board. In 
the United States, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is already up and running under 
the chairmanship of Bill McDonough. Knowing Bill from his days as chairman of the Basel Committee, 
that’s no surprise. And there are similar initiatives emerging in the EU and elsewhere. 
These  groups  are  interested  in  not  only  how  audits  are  conducted  but  in  the  quality  of  auditing 
standards. 
Audit enhancement benefits supervision (1) 
14.  
In  addition  to  helping  supervisors  carry  out  their  Pillar  2  and  3  responsibilities,  a  stronger  auditing 
regime provides several broader benefits. For example, auditors could be able to assist in verifying not 
only  regulatory  returns  and  financial  statements,  but,  in  the  context  of  Basel  II  and  IFRS,  various 
capital and accounting models. 
Audit enhancement benefits supervision (2) 
15. 
The  need  for  high  quality  audits  is  growing  and  auditors  must  keep  pace  with  the  increasing 
complexity of the banking business and bank accounting.  
4 
 BIS Review 56/2004
Identifying  the  substance  of  complex  transactions,  often  tailored  to  meet  unique  customer  or 
institutional needs, is not easy. Neither is understanding the complex rules that have been developed 
on how to account for financial instruments.  
As much as auditors need to understand these developments, supervisors must also be in a position 
to appreciate the quality of their work so that we know how and how much to rely on it. 
Further audit development and enhancement are welcome 
16. 
For  this  reason,  the Committee  supports continuing  work on  improving  the  audit  quality  chain.  This 
means  several  things:  completing  the  process  of  creating  and  implementing  the  PIOB;  evaluating 
governance  processes  within  individual  firms  and  dealing  with  any  issues  identified;  improving 
transparency  around  the  nature  and  scope  of  audit  work  performed;  and,  developing  high  quality 
standards  to  cope  with  critical  challenges  such  as  fair  value  measurement,  marking  to  model,  and 
transnational audits. 
Closing remarks: accounting (1) 
17. 
To wrap up, accounting is moving forward, but not necessarily in the same direction as supervisory 
guidance. This will require the Committee to do several things over the near and the longer term.  
First, we must remain closely involved in the standard setting process if we are to be effective. Our 
task  is  to  maintain  and  promote  a  prudent  and  forward-looking  stance  in  the  interest  of  financial 
stability.  
Earlier this morning, Malcolm Knight referred to the benefits of creating a “common language”, and in 
principle we agree with that. However, as supervisors, we will still need to determine what role we feel 
fair value accounting should play in financial reporting, and do our best to encourage standard setters 
to adopt an even more appropriate credit risk accounting model than the one we have right now.  
Nevertheless,  I  should  give  credit  to  the  IASB,  as  IAS  39  already  incorporates  important  concepts 
such as recognising impairments in groups of loans and applying experienced credit judgment to the 
determination of impairment. But they can still do better. 
Closing remarks: accounting (2) 
18. 
In parallel, we also need to develop ways to bridge the gap between the accounting and supervisory 
models where we can. This involves identifying where the gaps are and putting appropriate filters in 
place based on regulatory and capital reporting requirements.  
I  hope  that  these  filters  can  be  kept  to  an  absolute  minimum  and  only  over  the  short  term. 
Nevertheless, in the interests of maintaining financial stability and promoting sound risk management, 
these filters will have to remain for as long as the gaps exist. In addition, some buffers against the 
effects of short-term volatility may still be needed, although this need will be determined in the context 
of related prudential filters. 
Closing remarks: auditing 
19. 
For auditing, the Committee will need to remain focused on two objectives. First, improvement of the 
audit quality chain must continue. Second, we need to consider further what role the external auditor 
can play in relation to Basel II. 
In  a  moment  I’m  going  to  introduce  you  to  the  chairs  of  our  workshops  who  will  lead  today’s 
discussions of the four subject papers prepared for this conference. I’ve tried to incorporate many of 
the questions from these papers into my comments this morning.  
Let me set out the objectives I would like to see achieved in these sessions.  
First, I hope that you’ll share your experiences. We need to understand how these topics affect you, 
your banks and the way you supervise. 
BIS Review 56/2004

Second, please express your ideas on what we should be looking at. These will be useful in guiding 
the future work of the Committee and the ATF. 
Finally, don’t hesitate to ask questions or raise any short-term issues that we may have overlooked.
