Lars Heikensten: Introduction on monetary policy 
Speech by Mr Lars Heikensten, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at The Riksdag Committee on 
Finance, Stockholm, 14 October 2004. 
 Let me begin as usual by thanking you for the opportunity to come here and give an account of the 
Riksbank’s monetary policy. It is ten years now since my predecessor Urban Bäckström was here for 
the first time to attend a hearing under such transparent and public conditions. At that time the inflation 
target had only recently been introduced. Given that this is the tenth anniversary of the hearings in 
their current form, I think it is appropriate to begin by looking back on the past years. One conclusion is 
that much has gone well; the inflation rate has been low and stable, and growth in both real wages 
and  the  Swedish  economy  in  general  has  been  high.  Employment  growth  has  not  been  quite  as 
robust, however. Against this background, I will be focusing particular attention today on the issue of 
monetary policy’s ability to influence employment. By way of conclusion, I intend to touch upon the 
Riksbank’s outlook for economic developments and inflation in the years ahead and to comment on 
the decision we made yesterday regarding the repo rate. 
Ten years of low inflation 
New policy 
The crisis at the beginning of the 1990s was a dramatic, tragic conclusion to almost twenty years of 
stabilisation policy problems in the Swedish economy. The 1970s and 1980s witnessed a succession 
of  cost  crises.  The  fundamental  problem  was  that  economic  policy  had  been  unable  to  prevent 
excessively fast rises in wages and prices from ending up time and again on a collision course with the 
commitment  to  maintain  a  fixed  exchange  rate.  As  a  result,  the  krona  was  devalued  five  times 
altogether over the period 1976-82. When the fixed exchange rate was finally abandoned in November 
1992, following extremely high interest rates and costly attempts to defend the krona, it was obvious 
that  something  fairly  drastic  had  to  be  done  to  enable  the  Swedish  economy  to  develop  more 
favourably than during the previous twenty years. 
The solution was what could be called a shift in stabilisation policy regime, whereby the framework 
and rules for both monetary and fiscal policy were fundamentally changed. The shift in regime involved 
the introduction of a distinct division of roles in Swedish economic policy. The exchange rate remained 
variable and monetary policy was given the main task of trying to keep inflation at a low, stable level. 
Fiscal policy, which had often resulted in large deficits under the previous regime of a fixed exchange 
rate,  would  now  instead  be  targeted  at  achieving  long-term  stability  and  sustainability  in  the  public 
finances. 
Favourable results 
Looking back at the ten or so years that have passed since the change of regime, I think that most 
would agree with me that the shift in policy has turned out well and that the new stabilisation policy 
regime has lived up to our hopes. Sweden has gone from having been a high-inflation economy with 
recurring cost crises, high interest rates and unstable economic performance, to being an economy 
with low, relatively stable price rises and wage increases that put real money in people’s pockets, and 
where the risk of overheating and subsequent recession has diminished markedly. In an international 
perspective, too, the Swedish economy has performed well in the past decade, in stark contrast to the 
1970s and 1980s. 
The  robust  performance  is  evident  if  you  compare  developments  in  a  number  of  central  variables 
during  the  1970s  and  1980s  with  their  developments  under  the  new  stabilisation  policy  regime. 
(Chart 1.) 
In  the  1970s  and  1980s  the  rate  of  price  increases  stood  at  just  over  8  per  cent  a  year,  while  the 
corresponding rate since 1995 has been just below 2 per cent. The lower inflation rate has not entailed 
weaker growth in output. On the contrary, GDP growth has averaged around a half percentage point 
higher  a  year  under  the  new  regime.  Productivity  growth  has  also  been  more  robust.  The  higher 
BIS Review 59/2004

economic  growth  and  productivity  has  contributed  to  healthy  growth  in  real  wages.  This  is  one 
considerable difference compared with the developments in the 1970s and 1980s. While real wages 
have risen by about 2.5 per cent a year since 1995, the annual increase in real wages was no more 
than around 1 per cent in 1970-89. So, even though nominal wages rose more than 9 per cent a year 
during the 1970s and 1980s, purchasing power improved by only about 1 per cent; the high inflation 
and devaluations eroded the rest. 
In fairness, I should add that in addition to the shift in stabilisation policy regime there were a number 
of  significant  changes  in  other  areas  too  that  may  have  contributed  to  the  robust  performance.  For 
example, the rapid advances in information technology are likely to have contributed to the improved 
productivity. Another important factor underlying the stronger recorded productivity growth in the whole 
economy  is  the  relatively  smaller  role  of  the  public  sector  today  compared  with  ten  years  ago.  Yet 
another feature of the performance of the last ten years is deregulations and increased international 
competition,  the  latter  boosted  by  membership  of  the  EU  and  the  ongoing  integration  of  the  world 
economy. 
So,  Sweden’s  economic  performance  after  the  crisis  in  the  early  1990s  has  been  healthy  in  many 
respects. This does not mean that there are no problem areas. One of these is employment. There 
was indeed a relatively fast upturn in employment after the crisis years. It has also proved possible to 
combine low unemployment, compared with other European countries, with low inflation, contrary to 
what many experts expected. But open unemployment has only come down towards 4 per cent in a 
few occasional years, and stands today at 5.5 per cent. The number of employed now is lower than 
before the crisis, and some 1.2 million people of working age (16-64 years) are not participating in the 
labour force. 
The regime shift and employment 
Against  this  backdrop  it's  not  surprising  that  a  lively  debate  arises  from  time  to  time  about 
unemployment and what can be done about it. What is perhaps more surprising is that some people 
still assert that the shift in stabilisation policy regime at the beginning of the 1990s is what has caused 
unemployment to be higher today than it was during the 1970s and 1980s. Sometimes the argument 
goes that Sweden has given up its previous objective of full employment in order instead, for some 
more or less obscure reason, to introduce a target for inflation. If we only were prepared to return to 
the high-inflation policies of the 1970s and 1980s, then everything would be better. 
There  is  much  to  say  about  this.  Firstly,  it  is  difficult  in  a  more  general  sense  to  imagine  that  the 
markedly improved stability in economic policy that the shift in regime brought about in the long run 
could be something negative for employment. Instead, there are many reasons to believe that more 
stable  economic  performance  over  time  also  leads  to  conditions  that  foster  high  growth  and 
employment. 
Moreover, a simple comparison of unemployment data between the periods before and after the shift 
in regime proves rather misleading. This is because of the attempts in the 1970s and 1980s to meet 
the target of full employment through a policy that was unsustainable in the long run - it was exactly 
because  of  this  that  the  change  in  regime  was  implemented.  As  I  mentioned  earlier,  this  policy 
involved Sweden devaluing the krona as soon as we were hit by a cost crisis that resulted in weaker 
developments in exports and employment in the private sector. The devaluation of the krona restored 
competitiveness by lowering real wages for a number of years until excessive increases in prices and 
wages compared with abroad once again eroded the scope that had been created. The other way in 
which unemployment could be kept down was through a sharp increase in public sector employment. 
From  having  comprised  15  per  cent  of  the  labour  force  in  1960,  the  proportion  of  the  employed 
accounted  for  by  the  public  sector  rose  to  just over  30  per cent  by  the  end  of  the  1980s.  So  even 
though jobs were being lost in the private sector, employment held up through increased employment 
in the public sector. 
However, neither the decreases in real wages due to the devaluations or the increased public sector 
employment could solve the problems in the long run. As a result of the devaluation policy, it became 
increasingly difficult to keep inflation in check. Wage earners tried to compensate themselves for the 
reductions in real wages, and firms had little reason to resist; everyone believed that the krona would 
be  devalued if  price  and wage  inflation  became  too  high  and  competitiveness  was  threatened.  The 
expansion of the public sector contributed in turn to a rise in the tax burden that was unsustainable in 
2 
 BIS Review 59/2004
the  long  run.  One  way  of  putting  it  is  that  the  devaluations  and  the  increase  in  public  sector 
employment allowed us to put off dealing with our employment problems. 
Monetary policy and employment in the long term 
The  crucial  insight  when  discussing  unemployment  and  jobs  -  an  insight  which  has  firmly  rooted 
support  in  decades  of  economic  research  and  practical  experience  -  is  that  loose  monetary  policy 
cannot be used to bring about a lasting rise in employment. The best that monetary policy can do is to 
reduce the fluctuations in the cyclically determined component of unemployment. Consequently, it’s 
not  possible  to  create  lasting  jobs  by  systematically  keeping  interest  rates  low,  weakening  the 
exchange rate and allowing inflation to rise. 
In  other  words  there  is  no  opposition  between  a  target  for  inflation  at  the  levels  pursued  by  most 
central banks today and a policy of high employment. In order to reduce unemployment permanently, 
attempts must be made to influence the structural component of unemployment, i.e. the component 
that is not due to fluctuations in the demand for goods and services in the economy. And this requires 
completely  different  measures  than  those  of  monetary  policy.  In  particular,  it  is  a  question  of 
implementing measures that influence the functioning of the labour market. 
One  indication  that  the  employment  problems  we  are  seeing  today  are  largely  structural  is  the  big 
differences  in  unemployment  that  exist  between  different  regions  and  different  occupational 
categories. (Chart 2.) Unemployment figures are twice as high in some regions as in others, and the 
percentage  of  people  receiving  benefit  from  their  unemployment  fund  is  twice  as  high  in  some 
occupational groups as in others. The fact that these differences remain over long periods, even when 
there is a shortage of skilled labour, suggests that the labour market doesn’t function as well as might 
be  desired.  The  problems  in  the  Swedish  labour  market  are  also  underlined  by  the  fact  that  open 
unemployment barely came down to 4 per cent when economic activity was at its strongest a couple of 
years ago. 
Target deviations and employment 
How the Riksbank works 
So, even though monetary policy cannot be expected to have any tangible impact on employment in 
the long term, short-term effects can arise. This is because a policy aimed at attaining the inflation 
target may entail changes in interest rates, which temporarily affect demand so that employment rises 
or falls. The limit for how long and how much monetary policy can raise employment is determined in 
practice by the economy’s long-term growth potential, which in turn depends partly on how well the 
labour market functions. When we conduct monetary policy with an inflation target, this means under 
normal  circumstances  that  we  can  help  stabilise  actual  output  around  its  long-term  potential.  If  the 
Riksbank is to be able to take any account of employment in the short run, however, it is particularly 
vital that economic agents have confidence in monetary policy and the inflation target; this is a clear 
lesson from the situation in the 1970s and 1980s. 
As you know, the principal instrument we use to try to meet the inflation target is the repo rate. We set 
this rate with the aid of forecasts of inflation a couple of years ahead. Naturally, a lot can change in the 
space  of  two  years so  that  our  forecasts  do  not prove  accurate. We can  make  up  for  this to  some 
extent  by  being  able  to  change  the  rate  in  the  light  of  new  information.  But  we  can’t  compensate 
entirely for such events, of course. Sometimes, developments affect inflation at very short notice: a 
sharp hike in electricity prices, an equity price bubble that bursts, a war that heightens unease in the 
world and curbs demand, etc. In such cases it’s not possible to prevent inflation from deviating from 
the target, and even if it was possible to lessen the deviations, it may require such sharp movements 
in  interest  rates  and  such  substantial  effects  on  the  economy  that  it  would  not  seem  desirable  or 
reasonable. When inflation deviates from the target, we normally try to bring it back gradually to the 
target so as to avoid unnecessary fluctuations in the real economy and in interest rates. 
When Sweden became one of the first countries to define its objective for monetary policy in terms of 
a definite figure - even though we were very aware of the fact that it would be difficult to meet such a 
target exactly - we did so for several reasons. One was to find an anchor for policy - a target around 
which  inflation  expectations  could  be  stabilised.  But  it  was  also  done  with  a  view  to  facilitating 
evaluation of our activities and to make it easier to enforce accountability. Further steps were taken in 
the same direction when we, once again among the first in the world, decided to publish the material 
underpinning our decisions, mainly our inflation forecasts. This provided a more comprehensive basis 
BIS Review 59/2004 
 3
on which to analyse the background to our policy. Are deviations from the target a result of incorrect 
assessments? If so, in what respects? Do we differ from other forecasters or not, etc? The conditions 
for understanding and evaluating our actions were probably improved further when the Riksbank in 
1999  began  to  publish  the  minutes  from  its  monetary  policy  meetings.  Now  it  is  also  possible  to 
examine  the  arguments  put  forward.  Were  they  the  right  arguments  or  not  in  the  light  of  what  has 
happened?  On  the  whole,  I  believe  that  we  have  laid  a  solid  foundation  during  these  years  for  an 
in-depth assessment of our decisions.  
Inflation and inflation expectations 
So  how  well  has  the  Riksbank  succeeded  in  achieving  its  target  in  the  past  ten  years?  (Chart  3.) 
Looking at the average inflation rate since the target was introduced in 1993, CPI inflation has been 
1.8 per cent, while the measure of underlying inflation that we in practice have used over a large part 
of the period to explain our policy, UND1X, has been 2.1 per cent. If we instead make the comparison 
from 1995, the year when policy began to have its full impact, the corresponding figures are 1.4 and 
1.9  per  cent,  respectively.  Even  when  average  inflation  has  stood  fairly  close  to  the  target,  sharp 
deviations  can  of  course  occur  periodically.  This  has  also  been  the  case;  during  shorter  or  longer 
continuous periods inflation has been above or below target. At the same time it is also evident that 
the  size  of  the  deviations  depends  somewhat  on  the  inflation  measure  in  question.  UND1X  has 
fluctuated less as it is not affected as much by changes in interest rates and taxes. 
In this context it is also interesting to look at inflation expectations; have they been affected much by 
the fact that we sometimes have missed the target or that we on average have been slightly below it? 
(Chart 4.) Even though inflation expectations can be measured in different ways, the overall picture is 
clear. From around 1996-97 expectations have been fairly well in line with the target a couple of years 
ahead. Sometimes, of course, they have moved according to the actual inflation rate, but they have 
not been much above or below the target for any appreciable length of time. This is a much better 
performance than most expected when the monetary policy regime was changed in the early 1990s, 
and many doubted that we would attain the low, stable inflation that we actually have achieved. 
Allow  me  to  make  a  comment  in  this  context.  Sometimes,  it  is  claimed  that  the  Riksbank  acts 
asymmetrically, being more focused on avoiding exceeding the target than falling short. However, this 
view is not supported by measurements of inflation expectations: economic agents do not believe that 
we have a “secret agenda”. Instead, they believe that we try to do exactly what we are doing: trying 
our best to achieve inflation of 2 per cent and a stable economic performance in Sweden. 
Reasons for target deviations 
So  what  has  caused  the  target  deviations  in  the  past  ten  years?  Four  factors  seem  to  have  been 
especially significant: 
• 
At  the  beginning  of  the  period  with  an  inflation  target,  particularly  in  1996,  the  CPI  was 
affected  considerably  by  the  dramatic  decline  in  interest  rates  that  ensued  when  the 
credibility of the new regime was established.  
On a couple of occasions in the past years, rapid rises in energy prices in particular, but also 
in food prices, have pushed up inflation. The rises were essentially related to supply factors, 
such  as  water  shortages  in  hydroelectric  power  companies’  reservoirs.  The  effects  were 
judged to be temporary, which also proved to be the case.  
During certain periods, not least recently but  also in the latter part of the 1990s, imported 
inflation has been unexpectedly low.  
At  the  end  of  the  1990s  and  the  beginning  of  this  decade,  productivity  growth  has  been 
unexpectedly robust.  
   It is interesting to note that during several periods when inflation was below target, monetary policy 
was clearly loose at the same time as GDP growth was high. But in spite of this, inflation has been too 
low. What has happened above all is that unexpected supply changes have dampened inflation. This 
has been a global phenomenon to a large extent; in other words, a situation that we have shared with 
other countries.

Developments in recent years 
With hindsight, we can certainly see that the Riksbank has not always succeeded in predicting inflation 
correctly  and  that  monetary  policy  therefore  could  have  been  conducted  somewhat  differently  on  a 
number of occasions in the past ten years. This applies, for example, to 1995 and perhaps also to 
1999-2000,  even  though  the  latter  period’s  probably  too  low  interest  rates  did  not  have  any 
consequences  since  the  upswing  in  the  economy  and  inflation  was  broken  when  the  equity  price 
bubble  burst.  This  has  also  been  the  case  in  the  past  few  years.  Since  the  second  half  of  2003 
inflation has been below target, and it is likely that it will continue to be so for at least another half year 
or  so.  This  suggests  that  interest  rates  could  have  been  lower  in  primarily  2002  and  2003.  One 
conclusion from this is that we must deepen our understanding of factors such as productivity and of 
the impact on international prices of tough global competition. In these respects we are essentially in 
the same boat as other forecasters. As far as we can see, no Swedish forecasters have presented 
forecasts that have differed markedly from our own. In discussions with colleagues abroad, moreover, 
I have noted that all have been surprised by the low international inflation in the past year. When this 
kind of shock occurs, whether it is a question of lower or higher inflation, it is reasonable to allow the 
effects to dissipate gradually and not to act too strongly with the interest rate. 
One  feature  of  the  debate  on  monetary  policy  in  the  past  year  has  been  more  or  less  fanciful 
assessments of how much higher employment could have been if only the Riksbank had acted more 
prudently. The figures have varied from 20,000 up to 75,000 more jobs. It is certainly not easy to make 
these  kinds  of  counterfactual  estimates;  I  admit  that  much.  They  require  some  rather  bold 
assumptions.  They  presuppose  not  only  that  the  Riksbank  would  have  been  considerably  more 
successful  than  all  other  forecasters  in  assessing  where  the  economy  is  headed.  They  also 
presuppose  that  we  would  have  succeeded  in  convincing  external  parties  of  this  in  advance,  and 
would have done so at least partly during a period when inflation in Sweden was clearly above the 
2 per cent target. 
In order to get an idea of what the effects on employment of a different interest rate policy could have 
been,  we  have  conducted  a  couple  of  experiments  ourselves.  They  show  that  it  would  have  been 
difficult  to  achieve  employment  effects  over  10,000  people  even  if  the  repo  rate  had  been  a  whole 
percentage  point  lower  in  the  past  year.  In  order  to  put  this  figure  in  perspective,  it  may  be  worth 
remembering  that  around  200,000  people  in  Sweden  today  are  openly  unemployed  and  almost 
400,000 people of working age are on sick leave. For safety’s sake, I should perhaps also stress that it 
is a question moreover of a shift in the timing of an employment upswing, and not a question of jobs 
having been lost for good. 
Allow me to round off this discussion. In my opinion, the shift to low inflation has worked well on the 
whole, considerably better than most people thought. This does not mean of course that our policy at 
various times does not deserve criticism, and recently the Riksbank has undeniably fallen short of the 
2  per  cent  target.  This  spurs  us  to  deepen  our  understanding  of  the  inflation  process  even  more. 
Nevertheless, some of the criticism that has been levelled at the Riksbank has been out of proportion 
and ill-founded. The unemployment problem is so serious that it deserves a better discussion. 
The current assessment 
By way of conclusion, I shall now comment on the Inflation Report that we published today and the 
decision we made yesterday regarding the repo rate. 
The main scenario 
In  brief,  the  main  scenario  described  in  the  Inflation  Report  can  be  summarised  as  follows. 
International economic activity is expected to continue to strengthen this year. Over the coming two 
years, growth is expected to be robust, although it will probably be dampened somewhat. Thus far, the 
underlying  strength  of  the  upturn  has  if  anything  surprised  on  the  upside,  largely  thanks  to 
developments in a number of emerging economies in Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe. There 
is therefore reason to be slightly more optimistic than we were in the May Inflation Report with regard 
to short-term prospects for growth in the world economy, despite the signs of weaker developments in 
the United States. Coupled with the unexpectedly large price increases for oil and other commodities, 
this  means  that  international  price  pressures  are  expected  to  be  slightly  higher  than  previously 
forecast, particularly this year and next year. 
BIS Review 59/2004

Economic growth in Sweden is also forecast to be robust throughout the forecast period and has been 
revised  up  in  relation  to  the  May  forecast.  The  unexpectedly  high  international  demand  has 
contributed to surprisingly rapid growth in exports over the summer. The increasingly evident recovery 
in the IT and telecoms sector has also contributed to the favourable growth in exports. The Budget Bill 
contained signals of more expansionary fiscal policy in the period ahead, which can be expected to 
further boost demand in the economy through effects on both private and public consumption. New 
National Accounts data also indicate that the pickup in investment long expected by the Riksbank and 
other  forecasters  now  appears  to  have  begun.  As  in  the  May  Report,  gradually  higher  resource 
utilisation  and  rising  international  prices  are  expected  to  lead  to  a  gradual  increase  in  inflationary 
pressures.  So,  although  inflation  is  expected  to  be  slightly  higher  than  previously  anticipated,  our 
assessment is that it will be in line with the Riksbank’s target towards the end of the forecast period. 
Some questions 
One could say that the Inflation Report revolves around some questions, which I intend to touch upon 
briefly: 
• 
One  question  is  to  what  extent  the  high  oil  price  will  significantly  hamper  international 
economic activity. Although we, like most other forecasters, still assume that the oil price will 
fall again over the coming years, our assessment is that the price will be higher during the 
forecast period than we estimated in May. However, there are indications that the effects of 
the  high  oil  price  on  growth  will  be  relatively  limited.  For  instance,  the  rise  in  the  oil  price 
appears  to  be  largely  a  result  of  the  fact  that  the  world  economy  is  expanding,  although 
concern over terrorist acts and other factors also appears to have played a role. In addition, 
western world economies are today much less dependent on oil than they were in the 1970s, 
while  monetary  policy  is  now  conducted  in  a  way  that  makes  it  difficult  for  inflationary 
impulses from oil price rises to gain a foothold. Our current assessment is therefore that the 
high oil price will dampen, but not derail, the international economic upswing and that the 
effects on global inflation will be fairly modest.  
Another  question  is  how  inflation  could  be  so  low  thus  far  this  year,  despite growth  being 
relatively  high.  One  important  explanation  for  the  relatively  low  domestic  inflation  is,  as  I 
mentioned  earlier,  the  high  productivity  growth.  Combined  with  low  wage  increases,  the 
favourable productivity growth has meant that cost pressures in the Swedish economy have 
continued to be moderate. This has been the case despite electricity prices failing to fall as 
sharply as we assumed in May. Imported inflation, which I also touched upon earlier, has 
been weak as well. The high oil price has been countered by price falls for other imported 
goods, including clothes and footwear. This question is in turn connected with another: how 
is it that we expect inflation to remain relatively low during the forecast period when we have 
revised up our growth forecast? One explanation is that we have allowed our assessment to 
be  affected  by  the  new  productivity  figures,  the  lower  wage  outcomes  and  the  continued 
weak situation in the labour market. In our current assessment, inflation would probably have 
been around a tenth of a percentage point higher if we had not taken into account the new 
information received. 
 The balance of risks 
To sum up, the forecast in the main scenario is that Swedish GDP growth will be 3.6 per cent this year 
and 3.2 per cent a year in 2005 and 2006. Private consumption and investment are expected to take 
over from exports as the main driving forces behind the pickup in demand in 2005 and 2006. UND1X 
inflation is expected to be 1.4 per cent one year ahead and 2.0 per cent two years ahead, while the 
corresponding figures for CPI inflation are forecast to be 1.6 per cent and 2.5 per cent, respectively. 
This  time,  both  the  international  and  domestic  inflation  risks  are  judged  to  be  balanced.  On  the 
international front, the main upside risk is that the oil price will develop more unfavourably and have 
greater contagion effects on other prices than is currently foreseen. The downside risks mainly consist 
of a number of financial imbalances that could contribute both to lower inflation and weaker economic 
activity.  These  include  high  house  prices  and  an  increase  in  household  indebtedness  in  many 
countries, as well as the large deficits in the US federal budget and current account. On the domestic 
front, the risks are mainly related to productivity growth; more specifically to what extent the robust 
productivity reflects a more permanent structural phenomenon and to what extent it is due to cyclical 
6 
 BIS Review 59/2004
factors. There is considerable uncertainty in this regard and there is a risk both of overestimating and 
underestimating future productivity growth. 
The balanced risk outlook means that the probability of inflation being higher than the forecast in the 
main  scenario  is  judged  to  be  equal  to  the  probability  of  it  being  lower.  In  other  words,  the 
risk-adjusted inflation forecast is the same as the forecast in the main scenario. 
Interest rate decision 
Given  the  outlook  for  economic  developments  and  inflation  that  I  have  outlined  here,  we  decided 
yesterday to leave the repo rate unchanged.  
As  the  economic  upturn  progresses  and  resource  utilisation  increases  further,  it  is  reasonable  to 
assume  that  monetary  policy  will  in  future  need  to  become  gradually  less  expansionary.  There  is 
nothing dramatic about this; rather, this is normally necessary in an economic upswing to ensure that 
the inflation target is attained and that economic developments in the period ahead are stable. It is 
also  what  most  forecasters  appear  to  be  expecting.  However,  it  is  worth  emphasising  that  it  is  not 
possible at present to determine exactly when it may be appropriate to make a first adjustment of the 
interest rate level. This will depend as usual on how the Riksbank assesses the inflation outlook and 
on the new information received regarding economic developments. 
Thank you.
