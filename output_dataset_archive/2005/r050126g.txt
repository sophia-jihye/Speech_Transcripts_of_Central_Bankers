Shyamala Gopinath: Issues in strengthening commercial paper market 
Address by Ms Shyamala Gopinath, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at a seminar on 
“Issues in strengthening commercial paper market”, organised by the Bombay Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry and Fixed Income, Money Market & Derivatives Association, Mumbai, 17 January 2005. 
The assistance of S/Shri Deepak Mohanty and N S Rawat in the preparation of this address is gratefully acknowledged. 
 I  am  happy  to  be  with  you  today  in  this  seminar  on  “Issues  in  Strengthening  Commercial  Paper 
Market”. I am sure the seminar will bring out issues, which would be useful in further strengthening the 
CP market. 
It is worth noting that during late the 1980s, call/notice market was virtually the only segment in Indian 
money market. Today, we have a variety of new instruments e.g., CD, CP, Treasury bills, repo and 
CBLO catering to the varied needs of market participants. 
What has been the genesis of the CP market in market in India? How far has it come about? What are 
the outstanding issues? Let me share with you some of my thoughts on some of these issues. 
Genesis 
India initiated reforms in the money market way back in 1987. Pursuant to the recommendations of the 
Committee  to  Review  the  Working  of  the  Monetary  System  (Chairman:  Professor  Sukhamoy 
Chakravarty, 1985) and the Working Group on the Money Market (Chairman: Shri N. Vaghul, 1987), a 
number of measures were taken by RBI to widen and deepen the money market through institution 
building and instrument development. Accordingly, introduction of Commercial Paper (CP) as a money 
market  instrument  was  announced  in  the  Governor’s  statement  on  Monetary  and  Credit  Policy  in 
March 1989. It was then formally introduced in the market on January 1, 1990. We, thus, have a nearly 
15-year history of this market. 
At  the  time  of  introduction,  only  top  rated  corporates  with  tangible  net  worth  of  not  less  than 
Rs. 10 crore  were  allowed  to  issue  CP  with  maturity  between  3-6  months  from  the  date  of  issue. 
Further, issuance of the CP had to be carved out of the working capital (fund based) limit and it was 
also stipulated that CP could be issued in multiples of Rs. 25 lakh and the amount to be invested by a 
single investor should not be less than Rs 1 crore. 
These guidelines had been reviewed from time to time. However, major changes were effected last in 
October 2000, when the organic link of issuance of CP in relation to working capital (fund based) limit 
was  severed  and  CP  was  allowed  to  be  issued  as a  “stand  alone”  product.  At  present,  CP  issuers 
should  have  minimum  credit  rating  P2  or  its  equivalent  and  CP  can  be  issued  in  denomination  of 
Rs. 5 lakh or multiple thereof. CP can be issued in dematerialised form and non-bank entities including 
corporates may provide guarantee for CP issue subject to some prudential guidelines. 
Recent trends in CP market 
As you are aware, the amount of CP issued during any particular point of time generally depends on 
underlying  liquidity  i.e.,  higher  the  liquidity,  higher  would  be  the  issuances  of  CP.  Initially,  the 
CP amount outstanding rose from Rs. 86 crore as at the end of financial year 1989-90 to Rs. 577 crore 
as at the end of the year 1992-93 (Annex I). Following various relaxations in the terms and conditions 
for issue of CP viz., eligibility criteria, denomination of CP, quantum of CP that can be issued against 
maximum permissible bank finance (MBPF) and maturity of CP during the following years coupled with 
decline in discount rates, CP issuances gathered momentum thereafter and reached Rs. 7,224 crore 
by end-March 2002. 
The market experienced some sluggishness during January-October 2003. However, issuances of CP 
have increased in recent period following increasing investment interests seen from mutual funds and 
cost  effectiveness  in  issuances  of  CP.  Accordingly,  the  outstanding  amount  of  CP  increased 
substantially from the level of Rs. 9,131 crore in March 2004 to Rs. 12,107 crore by December 2004. 
This is the highest ever level achieved by the CP market since its inception.

Issuers’ profile in CP market has changed remarkably in recent period. The shares of manufacturing 
companies in aggregate amount of CP outstanding have gone down substantially over a period of time 
whereas those of leasing and finance companies and the financial institutions have started showing an 
increasing trend. 
The  share  of  manufacturing  companies  which  stood  as  high  as  at  86  per  cent  in  2000-01  declined 
progressively to 34 per cent in 2004-05 so far. This was not only on account of enhanced efficiency in 
their  operations,  but  also  due  to  larger  internal  accruals  and  better  cash  management.  Corporates 
raise funds at comparable rates from banks without incurring any additional cost towards stamp duty, 
demat costs, fees for IPA etc. associated with the launching of CP. 
The share of Leasing and Finance Companies (LFC) has started showing markedly increasing trend 
from only 13 per cent in 2000-01 to as much as 38 percent during 2003-04. Further, for the first time 
since the introduction of CP in 1990, in the current financial year up to December 2004, the share of 
Lasing and Finance Companies at 54 per cent is more than the share of manufacturing companies at 
34 per cent. 
The  shares  of  FIs  have  also  increased  dramatically  from  an  average  of  only  one  percent  during 
2001-02 to 18 percent during 2003-04 before declining to 12 per cent during 2004-05 so far. 
Regarding  ratings,  although  issuers  with  credit  rating  of  P2  of  CRISIL  or  equivalent  can  raise 
resources  through  CP,  in  effect,  the  CP  issuance  is  dominated  by  the  prime-rated  companies 
i.e., companies having credit rating of P1+ or its equivalent. Even then, there has been some decline 
in the share of CPs issued by prime-rated companies. During 2001-02, as much as about 93 per cent 
of CP amount issued were by prime-rated companies, which declined to 87 per cent during 2004-05 
so far. Correspondingly, the share of medium-rated companies increased from 7 per cent to 13 per 
cent over this period. This could be largely on account of search for higher return by investors in an 
environment of substantial improvement in liquidity in the economy. 
As you are aware, as a part of the eligibility criteria, the minimum tangible net worth of the corporate 
was reduced from the initial level of Rs. 10 crore to Rs. 4 crore in October 1993. However, corporates 
having  tangible  net  worth  of  up  to  Rs.10  crore  do  not  account  for  even  1  per  cent  of  the  total 
CP issuance.  The  market  is,  however,  dominated  by  corporates  having  tangible  net  worth  of 
Rs. 50 crore and above, which accounted for more than 93 per cent of the total CP amount issued 
during 2002-03 and 2003-04. Their share has, however, declined to 88 per cent during 2004-05 so far. 
In this backdrop, let me now turn to some of the recent steps taken by the Reserve Bank to strengthen 
the CP Market. 
Recent steps taken by RBI to further develop the market 
As you know, in order to further develop the CP market, we had placed a Status Paper on CP market 
in  India  on  the  RBI  website  on  July  7,  2004  for  inviting  comments/suggestions  from  market 
participants.  Subsequently,  the  issues  were  discussed  with  market  participants  as  also  in  the 
Technical  Advisory  Committee  on  Money,  Foreign  Exchange  and  Government  Securities  Markets. 
Accordingly, in the mid-term Review of the Annual Policy Statement for the year 2004-05, the following 
three recommendations were accepted viz., 
(i) 
(ii) 
reduction in minimum maturity period from 15 days to 7 days; 
reporting of issuance of CP on the Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) platform by the end of 
the day; and 
constitution  of  a  group  comprising  market  participants  to  rationalize  and  standardise, 
wherever  possible,  various  aspects  of  processing,  settlement  and  documentation  of 
CP issuance with a view to achieving the settlement at least on T+1 basis. 
(iii) 
In this regard, I would like to inform you that the minimum maturity period has since been reduced to 
7 days with effect from October 26, 2004. Further, necessary software development has been taken 
up for reporting of CP on NDS platform. We expect it to be ready by early this year. As regards the 
constitution  of  the  Group  to  rationalize and  standardise  the  various  market  practices with a  view  to 
achieving the settlement at least on T+1 basis, the Group has been set up under the chairmanship of 
Shri C.E.S. Azariah, Chief General Manager, State Bank of India within FIMMDA. I am told the Group 
is expected to submit the report soon.

The other recommendations made in the Status paper are as follows: 
• 
Rating: The Status Paper proposed that minimum credit rating may be brought down to P3 of 
CRISIL or its equivalent to provide wider choices to both issuers and investors. Incidentally, 
P3 is the lowest level among the investment grades. In this context, it may be noted that the 
CP market is generally accessible only to companies with high credit quality as only such 
companies can find buyers for their commercial paper. This is evidenced from the fact that 
prime  rated  companies  (i.e.,  P1+  or  equivalent)  constituted  about  87  per  cent  of  the  total 
amount of CP issued during 2004-05 so far as indicated above. Therefore, investors in the 
market appear to require commercial paper to have virtually no default risk. It may, however, 
be  noted  that  we  continue  to  maintain  P2  or  its  equivalent  as  the  minimum  credit  rating 
required for issue of CP. 
Asset backed commercial paper: The Status Report recommended introduction of ABCP for 
further deepening the CP market. Asset-backed commercial paper is fundamentally different 
from  traditional  commercial  paper.  It  is  essentially  a  pass  through  security  typically  with 
accounts  receivable  and  other  current  assets  as  the  backing  asset  that  is  being  passed 
through just as an asset backed mortgage security with mortgages payments being passed 
through.  In  a  way,  asset-backed  issuers  securitise  a  portfolio  of  cash  generating  assets 
funded by liabilities including CP. This process may enable smaller firms even with higher 
risks  to  access  the  CP  market.  Traditionally,  banks  use  ABCP  as  a  liquidity  management 
instrument. This is under examination of RBI. 
Reference  rate:  At  present,  issuers  decide  on  the  discount  rates  of  their  CPs  taking  into 
account  the  Reuters/Telerate  CP  reference  rate  as  well  as  the  supply-demand  forces 
prevailing  in  the  market.  In  this  context,  in  order  to  improve  transparency  and  strengthen 
efficiency, the Status Paper proposed to make reporting all CP deals mandatory, in line with 
the same for call/notice money deals, on the NDS platform so that benchmarking becomes 
more  appropriate  in  the  economy.  I  am  happy  to  indicate  that  the  necessary  software  for 
reporting  of  CP  on  NDS  platform  is  being  developed.  This  would  further  enhance 
transparency in the market. 
  Concluding observations 
In  conclusion,  I  may  say  that  the  adequate  growth  of  CP  market  in  India  is  immensely  important 
because it not only provides investors an avenue to invest in short-term quality papers, issuers also 
get an opportunity to fund themselves for working capital purposes from diversified sources including 
the banking sector. 
I sincerely appreciate BCCI and FIMMDA for taking the initiative in organising this seminar, where, I 
am  sure  that  the  participants  would  take  this  opportunity  to  discuss  in  detail  the  various  issues 
pertaining to strengthening the CP market. The Reserve Bank would welcome suggestions for further 
development of CP market.
