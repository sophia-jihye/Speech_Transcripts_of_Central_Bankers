Irma Rosenberg: Why is Swedish inflation so low? 
Speech  by  Ms  Irma  Rosenberg,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  the  shareholders’ 
meeting of SBAB - Sveriges Bostadsfinansieringsaktiebolag, Stockholm, 13 April 2005. 
 Introduction 
Thank you for your invitation to come here today.  
Inflation today is low and has fallen short of our inflation target since the middle of 2003. There are 
several explanations for this. One obvious reason is that our own interest rate cuts affect an important 
component in the consumer price index (CPI), namely homeowners’ interest costs, which decrease as 
a result. Another is the developments in electricity prices, although we had largely foreseen the effects 
of these. The principal factors, however, seem to have been the recent years’ high productivity growth 
in the Swedish economy and the drop in import prices. 
Current inflation is not the decisive factor behind the interest rate decisions that we make today. That 
is because it takes 1-2 years before rate adjustments have their full impact on inflation. Consequently, 
our interest rate decisions are based on an assessment of inflation prospects in the coming years. The 
current inflation rate is the starting point for this assessment, however, and it is therefore important to 
understand the underlying reasons for why inflation is so low today. Another reason is that it may be 
warranted in some situations to allow inflation to deviate from target for a period that extends beyond 
the normal forecast horizon, which is something I will be coming back to. A third reason is that it is 
important  for  the  Bank’s  future  forecasting  work  to  understand  why  our  forecasts  sometimes  are 
inaccurate. 
The low inflation rate has helped fuel the monetary policy debate in the past year. On the one hand, 
we have been criticised for not sticking to our normal policy rule and that monetary policy, given this 
rule,  is  not  expansionary  enough.  On  the  other  hand,  it  has  been  claimed  that  the  expansion  in 
household credit has been too fast and that the risk of a house price bubble should prompt us to raise 
the repo rate. One variation on the latter theme has been more general criticism that the Riksbank has 
its  hands  tied  as  a  result  of  its  own  inflation  target  and  that  its  policy  is  rigid.  The  essence  of  this 
seems to be that we have adopted an overly slavish approach in trying to meet the inflation target. So 
the question of how best to conduct monetary policy is not easy. As a result we always welcome a 
serious, challenging discussion.  
I intend today to try to answer the question of why inflation is so low, after which I will tie this in with 
recent developments and the current monetary policy situation. But before I do so, I would like to touch 
upon the fundamental issue of how we conduct monetary policy. 
A framework for monetary policy 
The  objective  of  Swedish  monetary  policy  is  explicitly  set  out  in  the  Sveriges  Riksbank  Act:  it  is  to 
maintain price stability. The Riksbank has defined this in terms of a target for inflation: to keep inflation 
at 2 per cent, with a tolerance for deviations of ± 1 percentage point. 
In practice the Riksbank’s conduct of monetary policy normally involves adjusting the repo rate with a 
view to influencing demand in the economy. By influencing borrowing costs, the incentives to save, 
exchange  rate  developments  and  thus  exports  and  imports,  etc.  the  repo  rate  has  an  effect  on 
aggregate  demand  in  the  economy  and  gradually  also  on  inflation.  It  is  generally  held  that  a  rate 
adjustment normally takes roughly 1-2 years before it has its greatest impact on inflation through these 
different "channels". 
That  means  that  our  interest  rate  decisions  must be  based on a  forecast  of  economic  and  inflation 
developments in the years ahead. Even though the current inflation rate is not the decisive factor for 
our interest rate decisions it is, of course, important nonetheless since it constitutes the starting point 
for our inflation forecast, which is the key element underpinning our decisions. To make the Riksbank’s 
monetary policy strategy clear it has been described in terms of a simple policy rule: if the forecast 
points to an inflation rate above 2 per cent 1-2 years ahead the repo rate should normally be raised, 
whereas it should normally be lowered if inflation is forecast to be below 2 per cent.

But this policy rule cannot be applied mechanically. That is why “normally” is included in the wording. 
We have also underscored time and again that the rule only helps us part of the way. There may be 
reason to depart from it. The Riksbank’s clarification of monetary policy in 1999 explains when this 
may  be  the  case.  One  reason  is  the  occurrence  of  a  shock  that  has  caused  inflation  to  deviate 
considerably  from  target.  In  such  cases  there  may  be  a  risk  of  undesirable  fluctuations  in  the  real 
economy if we were to try to bring inflation back to target within the normal time horizon. We have to 
be able to make allowances for such circumstances; otherwise they could have serious repercussions 
for  the  real  economy.  And  our  monetary  policy  framework  provides  scope  for  this.  But  no  two 
situations are ever exactly the same. It is necessary to have a thorough analysis on which to base our 
standpoints and an explanation for our decisions. Another reason to deviate from the policy rule is if 
inflation  is  judged  to  be  influenced  by  temporary  effects,  i.e.  effects  that  will  diminish  without  any 
monetary policy intervention. That, for example, is why we often focus our discussion on UND1X, the 
measure  of  underlying  inflation  that  excludes  the  effects  of  indirect  taxes  and  subsidies  as  well  as 
interest rate changes. But it can also be a case of temporary supply shocks that are not expected to 
persist, such as the sharp rise in electricity prices at the turn of the year 2002/2003. 
For a number of years the confidence in monetary policy and economic policy in general has been 
high enough to allow such factors to be taken into account. But at the same time it places demands on 
our communication – that we are clear, for example, about when there is reason to extend the forecast 
horizon  and  why.  It  is  also  one  of  the  reasons  that  we  introduced  some  improvements  to  our 
decision-making material in our most recent Inflation Report, which we expect will help us explain and 
justify our actions more clearly. These included extending our forecast horizon somewhat in certain 
situations. 
So we do have room for a considerable measure of flexibility. And we have also made use of that over 
the years. On several occasions, e.g. 2001 and 2003 but also earlier, we made it clear that we had 
disregarded  transitory  effects  that  were  affecting  inflation.  The  Riksbank  has  also  referred  to 
developments in asset prices, e.g. in 2000, but we did not believe at the time that it gave reason to 
allow policy to be affected to any great extent. Recently, however, developments in property prices 
have had some, albeit limited, significance for our monetary policy decisions. 
The inflation target is thus our point of departure, and we normally apply a time horizon that reflects 
the lag with which monetary policy has an impact on inflation. But we are prepared to depart from this 
if we have good reason to. Our ambition in such cases is to communicate the reasons clearly. 
Why has inflation been so low? 
Let me now go on to address the factors behind the current inflation rate. The gauge that the Riksbank 
has chosen for its inflation target, the consumer price index (CPI), measures the price of a basket of 
goods and services for household consumption. On average, the rate of increase of the CPI has been 
1.4 per cent1 from 1995, when the inflation target was introduced, through 2004 (Chart 1). The CPI is 
the broadest index that we use and includes the effect of our interest rate adjustments on mortgage 
interest expenditure. The fact that average CPI inflation has been so low is due in large measure to 
the Riksbank’s rate cuts in the mid-1990s, when confidence in the inflation targeting policy increased. 
In  terms  of  UND1X,  which  excludes  this  effect,  inflation  has  averaged  1.8  per  cent  over  the  same 
period. UND1X inflation has in actual fact guided the Riksbank’s monetary policy for a large part of the 
current period and is thereby also an important inflation measure when evaluating policy. 
In recent years, however, inflation has been markedly lower. Since May 2003 it has averaged 0.8 per 
cent  according  to  the  CPI.  The  substantial  monetary  easing  that  began  at  the  end  of  2002  and 
continued through 2003 and 2004 has held down households’ interest costs and thereby contributed 
to the low CPI inflation. But inflation has been below target in terms of UND1X as well; on average it 
has  been  1.2  per  cent  over  the  same  period.  This  is  partly  because  electricity  prices  rose  to 
record-high levels at the turn of the year 2002-2003 and then fell back somewhat. We judged that to 
be a temporary effect and predicted that electricity prices would fall back, thus bringing inflation figures 
down  again.  For  both  CPI  and  UND1X  inflation  this  meant  that  the  change  in  relation  to  the

rest of the discussion is based on the new CPI method, though

corresponding  month  a  year  earlier  dropped  sharply  at  the  beginning  of  2004  –  an  effect  that  was 
partly expected, as I was saying. 
But  excluding  energy  prices,  too,  inflation  since  the  beginning  of  2003  has  been  very  low,  with 
non-energy UND1X averaging 0.9 per cent. There are many reasons for that, but the most important is 
unusually  low  import  prices  and  surprisingly  high  domestic  productivity  growth.  Allow  me  now  to 
discuss this in a little more detail. 
One way to do so is to look at the developments in different components of the CPI. As a first step, the 
CPI can be broken down into prices of goods and services. I then choose to exclude oil, electricity and 
mortgage  interest,  which  we  already  know  has  contributed  to  the  low  CPI  inflation.  Goods  prices 
(Chart 2) rose weakly in 2003, but since the end of the same year they have been falling. The rate of 
price increases for services has diminished in recent years and currently stands at roughly 2 per cent. 
So this does not appear at first sight to be a contributory factor to the low CPI inflation. It is important 
to  remember,  though,  that  productivity  growth  in  the  services  sector  is  normally  assumed  to  be 
somewhat lower than in the goods sector. Given an inflation target of 2 per cent, therefore, services 
prices should, on average, be increasing slightly more than 2 per cent and goods prices by somewhat 
less. With the exception of short periods this has also been the case since 1995, as services prices 
have risen on average by 2.5 per cent and goods prices by 0.6 per cent. So, developments in services 
prices  have  also  contributed,  at  least  in  the  most  recent  period,  to  the  low  inflation.  The  chief 
remaining explanation for the low CPI inflation appears, however, to be found in the developments in 
goods prices. 
Falling goods prices contributing to the low inflation 
When it comes to goods prices it is natural to distinguish between price developments for domestically 
produced  goods  and  goods  that  are  imported  from  other  countries.  Prices  of  imported  consumer 
goods have dropped since the middle of 2003. But inflation for domestically produced goods has also 
been low, with prices even falling during the second half of last year (Chart 3). 
Consumer prices for both domestically produced and imported goods depend on many factors, e.g. 
the competition situation both abroad and in the home market and developments in costs and profit 
margins for both producers and distributors. To better understand why inflation is so low, the next step 
is to analyse the various stages from the production or importing of goods until the goods are put up 
for sale to consumers in shops. 
Allow me to begin by looking at developments in the producer prices of domestic goods and in the 
prices of imported goods at customs, i.e. the prices paid by wholesalers in the distribution sector. I will 
then analyse how the path through the distribution sector can be thought to affect the final price of the 
goods that customers buy in shops, i.e. the price in the CPI. 
Producer prices of domestically produced goods 
The rate of increase for producer prices of domestically produced consumer goods has been very low 
since the beginning of 2003 but has risen weakly from 0.5 per cent to about 1 per cent in February this 
year (Chart 4). 
The main driver of a company’s production costs, and thereby the price of its products, is the costs of 
intermediate goods and labour costs. Intermediate goods costs in manufacturing dropped in 2002 and 
2003,  after  which  they  increased  by  2.3  per  cent  in  2004  according  to  the  National  Institute  of 
Economic  Research’s  estimates  (Chart  5).  Product  prices  have  by  and  large  followed  the  cost 
developments for intermediate goods, even though changes in the costs of intermediate goods do not 
feed through fully to product prices. Thus, having fallen for a period, product prices for industrial goods 
also  began  to  rise  towards  the  end  of  2003  although  the  rate  of  increase  stopped  at  1  per  cent  in 
2004. 
Since the latter half of the 1990s labour costs per hour in the Swedish manufacturing sector have risen 
at  a  somewhat  diminishing  rate.  Coupled  with  high  productivity  growth,  this  has  resulted  in  sharply 
falling unit labour costs (Chart 6). That contributed to a slight rise on average in profit margins in the 
manufacturing sector last year as well, despite the fact that the increase in intermediate goods prices 
did not completely pass through to product prices. 
BIS Review 25/2005

Stiffer  competition,  partly  due  to  low  prices  of  imported  goods,  increased  import  penetration,  i.e.  a 
higher share of imported goods in total consumption, and new foreign players in the Swedish market 
may  have  contributed  to  the  high  productivity  growth  and  the  low  producer  price  inflation  for 
domestically produced goods. 
Producer prices for imported goods 
Import  prices  for  consumer  goods  have  fallen  since  the  end  of  2002  (Chart  4).  Import  prices  in 
Swedish kronor are determined by the price developments and price level in the countries from which 
we import, how large a share we import from each country and developments in the exchange rate. 
The krona has strengthened more or less continuously from its weak level at the end of 2001, and this 
of course has contributed to the fall in import prices in recent years (Chart 7). In 2004, however, the 
krona did not appreciate to the same extent, but prices of imported goods continued to drop. To some 
extent this may reflect a lag in the pass-through of the krona’s appreciation but price developments for 
consumer  goods  in  international  markets  have  also  been  subdued  during  the  recent  economic 
slowdown. 
The  weak  imported  inflation  is  also  due  in  some  measure  to  the  fact  that  we  have  continually 
increased our share of imports from low-cost countries such as China and Poland. According to a first 
preliminary  estimate  by  the  Bank,  this  import  switch  to  cheaper  countries  in  general  may  have 
contributed  to  reducing  the  prices  paid  by  Swedish  importers  by  a  couple  of  percentage  points  in 
2004.  This  estimate  is  uncertain  since  in  most  cases  there  is  no  data  available  for  how  different 
trading-partner  countries‘  export  prices  to  individual  recipient  countries  evolve,  only  their  average 
export price. Nor is there data for our total imports from non-EU countries because all imports from 
these countries that reach Sweden via another EU country are registered in the statistics as imports 
from the EU. As a result, it is likely that this estimate does not measure the right price and probably 
underestimates the low-cost countries’ share of our total imports. So the effect of this import switch is 
probably somewhat understated. 
In the measure we currently use for international prices in our forecasting the concentration of low-cost 
countries is slightly smaller than that used in this estimate. It is therefore likely that our forecast for 
import prices has not fully captured the shift towards cheaper import countries. As mentioned in the 
Inflation  Report,  this  is  one  possible  explanation  for  why  our  forecasts  have  not  managed  to 
completely capture the fall in import prices. 
Weak producer price inflation not the whole explanation 
The conclusion of the discussion so far is that a combination of low price increases for intermediate 
goods, subdued wage growth and robust productivity growth in manufacturing has held down producer 
price inflation for domestically produced goods since the middle of 2003. In addition, it is likely that the 
krona’s appreciation, but also the rise in the share of imports from low-cost countries, has contributed 
to  the  low  rate  of  price  increases  for  consumer  goods.  But  that  does  not  appear  to  be  the  whole 
explanation.  If  we  take  a  weighted  average  of  the  producer  price  developments  for  domestically 
produced  and  imported  consumer  goods  –  the  dotted  curve  in  the  chart  –  it  becomes  clear  that 
consumer goods prices have fallen even more than producer prices in 2004 (Chart 4). 
The distribution sector 
This is because consumer prices are also affected by what happens in the distribution sector, i.e. the 
part  of  the  business  sector  that  supplies  the  domestically  produced  and  imported  goods  to  the 
customer.  This  includes  wholesalers  and  retailers  and  involves  such  things  as  stock-keeping, 
transportation, administration, the range of goods offered and marketing. The end price of a good is 
therefore influenced by factors such as the degree of competition, profit margins, wage developments 
and productivity growth in this sector. The ability to investigate this in greater detail is limited, however, 
by insufficient data. 
The part of the distribution sector that involves transportation saw a fall in unit labour costs in 2003 
and  2004,  while  profit  margins  have  recovered  somewhat.  In  the  statistics  this  sector  includes  a 
number  of  less  relevant  groups,  such  as  restaurants,  hotels  and  communication.  In  wholesale  and 
retail trade, unit labour costs have increased at a lower and lower rate in recent years, and didn’t rise 
4 
 BIS Review 25/2005
at all in 2004. Meanwhile, profit margins rose slightly after having fallen from 23 to 15 per cent in the 
past ten years (Charts 8 and 9). 
In  addition,  competition  in  the  retail  sector  has  increased  considerably  in  recent  times  due  to  the 
establishment  of  more  and  more  low-price  chains.  Among  other  things,  that  is  being  reflected  in 
large-scale marketing campaigns in which one big chain store after another is advertising price cuts. 
Food  prices  in  the  CPI  have  also  dropped.  Nevertheless,  profit  margins  appear  to  have  increased 
slightly in 2004. That may be attributable to increased efficiency as a result of larger shop space, a 
higher proportion of own brands and possibly a more effective use of IT. 
Supply factors behind the low inflation 
This shows that supply factors are the main force driving the low inflation. The low domestic inflation is 
due in large measure to the high productivity growth in the economy. Structural changes, too, such as 
the stiffening competition in the retail food sector, which has recently resulted in a drop in food prices, 
have played a part. The slack in resource use that has been evident in the economy for some time has 
of course also contributed to the low domestic inflation. 
We can also observe that the prices of imported goods have fallen in recent years. That is partly due 
to the krona’s appreciation and partly to low price increases for consumer goods in the international 
market.  Increased  imports  from  low-cost  countries  have  also  led  to  greater  downward  pressure  on 
prices of imported consumer goods than we previously expected. 
Having  looked  back  at  these  developments  I  now  intend  to  look  ahead  and  touch  upon  the 
assessment of the economic and inflation outlook that we presented in our latest Inflation Report in 
light of the information received since then.  
The current economic situation 
In the Inflation Report that was published in the middle of March we forecast that economic growth in 
both Sweden and abroad would remain high in the coming years. For Sweden we predicted a growth 
rate of roughly 3 per cent a year, which is higher than we deem sustainable in the long run. Export 
demand  was  expected  to  rise  at  a  slower  pace,  while  domestic  demand  was  forecast  to  increase 
somewhat faster, mainly owing to increased investment but also to a slightly stronger pick-up in private 
consumption. That was also assumed to contribute to an improvement in the labour market. 
Against  the  background  of  the  continued  cyclical  upswing  and  expectations  of  a  reduction  in  spare 
resources,  domestic  inflation  was  forecast  to  rise.  Higher  wage  costs  in  line  with  an  increase  in 
employment and lower productivity growth was assumed to imply a faster increase in unit labour costs 
and  a  gradual  rise  in  companies’  costs.  The  factors  that  had  resulted  in  falling  prices  for  imported 
goods in the past year were estimated to gradually diminish during the forecast period, even though 
we anticipated that imported inflation would remain low in the period ahead as well. It is reasonable to 
expect that a pick-up in resource utilisation in the world economy will lead to higher international price 
pressures. We also made the assessment that the krona would not appreciate nearly as much during 
the forecast period as in recent years and that it would therefore not have as large a restraining effect 
on price increases in Swedish kronor in the period ahead. The shift seen in imports in recent years, 
which has involved a greater share coming from low-cost countries, is likely to continue, however, and 
probably depress import prices in the period ahead as well. All in all, this gave us reason to expect a 
continued low but gradually rising inflation rate for a large part of the forecast period, and an inflation 
rate in line with the target towards the end of the period. 
The  information  received  about  the  Swedish  economy  since  the  publication  of  the  Inflation  Report 
points to a stable upswing in economic activity with an increased contribution from domestic demand. 
However, the foreign trade statistics and the National Institute of Economic Research’s most recent 
business tendency survey suggest that manufacturing activity may have begun to slow and that the 
expansion  in  the  export  industry  may  have  been  dampened  somewhat  faster  than  expected. 
Meanwhile,  the  same  survey  points  to  increasingly  strong  domestic  demand  in  sectors  such  as 
construction, trade and private services. Retail sales have grown in line with what we assumed in our 
forecasts and Swedish households have become more optimistic about the future. Recently, however, 
the oil price has returned to a very high level and some indicators in the euro area have been weak. 
Nevertheless, on the whole the developments appear to be broadly in line with the economic outlook 
we presented in the previous Inflation Report.

Concluding remarks 
Allow me to conclude by reiterating that we expect inflation to be lower than target for a large part of 
the  forecast  period.  The  main  driving  forces  behind  the  low  inflation  are  supply  factors  that  in 
themselves are favourable for Sweden’s economic performance and that by and large are not affected 
by monetary policy. Interest rates are already record-low and this has resulted in a fast increase in 
household  borrowing  and  house  prices.  Monetary  policy  is  stimulating  demand  at  a  time  when  the 
economy is growing at a rate that is not judged to be sustainable in the long term. We therefore expect 
resource utilisation to rise in the coming years and, as a result, cost pressures and inflation too. Our 
most recent forecast points to an inflation rate in line with the target at the end of the forecast period. 
Our conclusion at the last monetary policy meeting was that the repo rate should be left unchanged at 
present, but that there was not any hurry to raise it either. The new data that has been received since 
the publication of the Inflation Report gives us no reason at present to revise that assessment. 
Finally, I would also like to remind you that we regularly assess the new information that we receive 
and  its  effects  on  future  inflation.  For  example,  we  could  end  up  in  a  situation  where  we  see  that 
economic activity is either being notably dampened or is speeding up unexpectedly; in such a case 
there may of course be reason to revise our assessment.
