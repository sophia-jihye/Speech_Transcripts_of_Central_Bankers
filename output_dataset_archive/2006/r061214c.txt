Nils Bernstein: Financial crises – talks in relation to financial stability in 
Denmark  
Speech by Mr Nils Bernstein, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the National Bank of Denmark, 
at the conference to mark the 125th anniversary of the first Danish savings bank act – the Savings 
Bank Act of 1880, Copenhagen, 12 September 2006.  
 Thank you for inviting me to participate in the celebration of the 125th anniversary of the first Danish 
savings  bank  act.  I  have  been  asked  to  speak  about  Danmarks  Nationalbank's  tasks  in  relation  to 
financial stability under the main heading of "Financial crises".  
Financial crises can involve very serious costs. A survey by two economists, Hoggarth and Saporta, 
covering 43 financial crises in developed and developing countries shows that the average costs to 
society amounted to around 15 per cent of GDP. It can also be a costly affair to save one major bank 
in  order  to  prevent  economic  collapse.  A  domestic  case  in  point  is  the  rescue  plan  to  assist 
Landmandsbanken in 1922-23. It cost the Treasury kr. 40 million, and according to the historian Søren 
Mørch that was equivalent to 2/3 of the total government budget for social expenditure at the time. 
So, what are Danmarks Nationalbank's tasks in relation to financial stability?  
If we go back to the Danmarks Nationalbank Act from 1936, it states that Danmarks Nationalbank shall 
"maintain a safe and secure currency system in this country, and [...] facilitate and regulate the traffic 
in money and the extension of credit".  
There is thus no doubt that this is our task in relation to financial stability. However, the Act does not 
say how we should shoulder this responsibility. Perhaps that is just as well, since the task changes 
over time. At Danmarks Nationalbank we have defined financial stability as a state that exists:  
when  the  financial  system  is  robust  enough  for  any  problems  experienced  within  the  sector  not  to 
spread  and  prevent  the  financial  markets  from  functioning  as  providers  of  capital  and  financial 
services.  
In other words, the focus is on the functioning of the financial system. Smooth provision of money in 
our  society  is  a  prerequisite  to  a  well-functioning  Danish  economy,  but  also  the  basis  for  effective 
implementation of a market-oriented monetary policy.  
It is important to avoid problems in financial enterprises, not only for depositors and shareholders, but 
also for society at large. Problems within one bank tend to spread to other financial institutions – or at 
any rate to affect their reputation. Depositors and investors may loose faith in the financial system. A 
domino effect is created.  
How does Danmarks Nationalbank actually solve its tasks in relation to financial stability? I would now 
like to show you some examples, and after that I will present a challenge.  
Firstly, we seek to analyse the key risks to the financial sector. This includes situations that are very 
unlikely to arise, but which could potentially involve high costs to society. We perform stress tests on 
the financial system in order to calculate how large an adverse impact the existing buffers are able to 
absorb.  
We publish these analyses in our annual Financial Stability report with a view to opening a dialogue 
with public authorities, banks and other sector representatives about risks to and developments within 
the financial sector. Some call this "open mouth" operations. 
On the basis of analyses and stress tests, our most recent Financial Stability report concluded that the 
financial institutions are still robust, and that there are currently no black clouds on the horizon that 
could threaten financial stability in Denmark.  
We have become accustomed to seeing the banks make record-high profits every year. An important 
factor in this context is the high growth in lending; a rate of growth last seen in the mid-1980s.  
As Chart 1 shows, the high-growth period in the mid-1980s was followed by a gradual erosion of credit 
quality, with increased losses and provisions in the subsequent period.

I am not saying that history will repeat itself. We should not forget that the new Basel II Capital Accord, 
which  takes  effect  at  the  beginning  of  2007,  has  increased  focus  on  the  banks'  credit  risk 
management.  
When we at Danmarks Nationalbank assess the banks' credit risk, our starting point is a failure-rate 
model developed on the basis of 400,000 annual accounts filed by Danish companies in the period 
from  1995  to  2002.  This  model  is  similar  to  those  used  by  the  banks  as  a  basis  for  the  advanced 
methods  that  may  be  used  under  Basel  II.  The  failure-rate  model  estimates  the  probability  that  a 
company will fail. 
As  Chart  2  illustrates,  our  analysis  based  on  the  failure-rate  model  shows  that  there  is  a  certain 
tendency for banks with high growth in lending in recent years also to have higher credit risk on their 
lending portfolios. There are exceptions, but we still need to be aware of the link between high growth 
in lending and the risk of subsequent higher losses.  
Another topical issue we have examined is the large gross debt of Danish households compared to 
households in other countries. Chart 3 shows the debt as a ratio of GDP. The high gross debt ratio, 
combined  with  the  extensive  use  of  adjustable-rate  mortgage-credit  loans,  makes  the  households 
more vulnerable to rising interest rates.  
We  have  calculated  the  households'  additional  mortgage  interest  burden  if  interest  rates  rise.  On 
average, mortgage interest expenses will increase by 1.2 per cent of the household's gross income if 
interest rates rise by 1 percentage point, but there are considerable variations. Some households will 
be  financially  challenged  if  interest  rates  increase  by  a  few  percentage  points.  This  could  impose 
losses  on  banks  and  mortgage-credit  institutes.  Nevertheless,  our  overall  assessment  is  that  the 
development in homeowners' exposure to rising interest rates does not threaten the functioning of the 
financial system – or financial stability. To put it bluntly, the failure of a number of households to meet 
their obligations to their credit institutions is not necessarily a financial stability problem.  
In  the  past  year,  the  IMF  has  visited  Denmark  in  connection  with  its  FSAP,  Financial  Sector 
Assessment Program. As in other member countries, the IMF assessed the structure of the Danish 
financial system. A report will be published within a month or so.  
In  connection  with  the  FSAP  a  stress  test  was  conducted  to  assess  whether  the  Danish  financial 
system is robust to cyclical changes. The basis for the stress test included Danmarks Nationalbank's 
macro  model,  MONA,  and  a  stress  test  module  that  we  have  estimated.  The  worst-case  scenario 
applied by the IMF involves a slowdown of the domestic economy, exacerbated by monetary-policy 
tightening  by  the  ECB.  House  prices  will  fall  by  30  per  cent  and  GDP  by  3  per  cent  over  a  3-year 
period. A strong cocktail indeed.  
The result of Danmarks Nationalbank's stress test is shown in Chart 4, where the blue line represents 
the  actual,  historical  losses  to  the  banks,  while  the  yellow  line  shows  modelled  calculations  of  the 
historical development, and the broken line is the expected development, given the stress scenario. 
According  to  the  calculations,  the  banks'  average  losses  would  increase  to  almost  1.5  per  cent  of 
loans and guarantees. This is somewhat lower than in the early 1990s, when losses and provisions 
reached 2.5 per cent on average. Overall, the Danish financial system is therefore reasonably robust. 
Nevertheless, a few banks may suffer substantially higher losses, just as there were banks in the early 
1990s that lost more than 10 per cent.  
Stress testing will be given higher priority in our future assessments of financial stability. Our ambition 
is to learn more about how the banks affect each other and the economy in stress situations.  
Another task for Danmarks Nationalbank in relation to financial stability is to ensure that Denmark has 
a  secure  and  effective  financial  infrastructure  that  can  safely  be  used  for  settlement  of  payments, 
securities  trading  and  other  financial  transactions.  Danmarks  Nationalbank  now  has  a  statutory 
obligation to oversee payment and settlement systems in Denmark.  
Part  of  the  IMF's  FSAP  was  to  assess  the  core  elements  of  the  Danish  financial  infrastructure  in 
relation to international standards. The IMF recommended a few changes. Danmarks Nationalbank will 
work with those responsible for the systems to ensure that the necessary improvements are made. 
However, we will not blindly adhere to all recommendations.  
For  example,  the  IMF  recommends  that  we  establish  a  buffer  pool  to  ensure  the  settlement  of 
securities  transactions  and  retail  payments  even  if  the  largest  participant  is  not  able  to  settle  its 
payment  obligations.  Danmarks  Nationalbank  finds  that  the  best  safeguard  is  to  ensure  that 
2 
 BIS Review 122/2006
participants have easy and flexible access to liquidity, combined with participants' large portfolios of 
securities that can be pledged as collateral for loans from Danmarks Nationalbank. Consequently, we 
do not currently see any need for special measures to ensure settlement in the Danish systems.  
A  third  area  that  we  are  looking  at  is  situations  where  the  financial  system  is  affected  by  dramatic 
external events. These could be acts of terrorism, widespread epidemics, natural disasters or other 
situations where the financial system threatens to collapse.  
Danmarks  Nationalbank  chairs  a  task  force  to  ensure  coordination  of  the  financial  institutions' 
business continuity plans in such situations.  
Finally,  Danmarks  Nationalbank  acts  as  lender  of  last  resort  to  the  Danish  banks.  Danmarks 
Nationalbank  can  extend  loans  to  a  bank  that  urgently  needs  liquidity  and  cannot  procure  it  in  the 
market, even though the bank is solvent.  
Fortunately, we are seldom called on to do that.  
Should  a  situation  occur  where  it  is  necessary  to  rescue  an  ailing  bank,  Danmarks  Nationalbank's 
position is that a market-based solution should be found.  
Nothing definite can be said beforehand about Danmarks Nationalbank's role. It would depend on a 
concrete  assessment  of  the  situation  and  the  –  direct  or  indirect  –  consequences  for  the  Danish 
banking system and Danish society.  
However, we can look at what Danmarks Nationalbank has done on previous occasions.  
In a number of cases, Danmarks Nationalbank has played a role in connection with public intervention 
to help ailing banks – by providing financial assistance or expertise. Each time the situation has been 
so  serious  that  it  could  potentially  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  Danish  banking  system  or  cause 
foreign banks to lose faith in Danish banks.  
The initial step has been to provide stand-by liquidity facilities so as to give the bank in question some 
room  to  manoeuvre.  However,  Danmarks  Nationalbank  has  also  provided  guarantees  to  creditors 
jointly with the private banks – often on the basis of a government guarantee. In several cases, the 
involvement  of  Danmarks  Nationalbank  has  been  conducive  to  a  solution  with  the  participation  of 
private banks. 
A classic example of our role as lender of last resort was an episode in the summer of 1992 when 
there were rumours that Unibank was facing difficulties. Since it was Denmark's second largest bank, 
it was certainly a bank that was of significance to the Danish banking system. The episode coincided 
with  the  banking  crisis  in  the  other  Nordic  countries  and  is  mentioned  in  Danmarks  Nationalbank's 
Report and Accounts 1992:  
"Early  in  the  summer,  rumours  arose  that  Unibank  was  facing  difficulties.  These  rumours  were 
immediately  disproved  by  the  Danish  Financial  Supervisory  Authority,  but  in  order  to  counter  any 
liquidity problems abroad for Danish banks as a consequence of the rumours concerning a bank which 
did  comply  with  the  solvency  requirements,  the  Nationalbank  made  a  stand-by  agreement  with 
Unibank to supply liquidity if necessary, cf. the Nationalbank's press release of June 21, 1992." As we 
know, Unibank pulled through.  
Finally, I would like to draw attention to a challenge that we are facing. 
In the banking area, financial integration is at a more advanced level in the Nordic region than in the 
rest of  the  EU,  and most  large banks have  branches  or subsidiaries  in other  Nordic  countries.  The 
most  prominent  example  is  Nordea,  which  has  significant  market  shares  in  each  of  the  Nordic 
countries (except Iceland) – in Denmark's case almost a quarter of all deposits.  
EU legislation has contributed to harmonising the basis for conducting activities in the financial sector 
and removed barriers to cross-border operations. This is part of the process to create a single financial 
market in the EU.  
Nordea  currently  operates  with  a  subsidiary  structure,  so  that  the  national  authorities  are  still 
responsible for supervision and oversight of its activities in each country. For Nordea Danmark, this 
responsibility lies with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority.  
This will change if Nordea – as announced some years ago – chooses to merge into one bank with 
branches  in  the  various  countries.  In  that  case,  the  authorities  in  its  home  country  –  presumably 
Sweden  –  would  have  the  principal  responsibility  for  activities  in  Denmark,  just  as  the  Danish 
BIS Review 122/2006

authorities currently supervise e.g. Danske Bank's activities in its Swedish branch. That is how the EU 
legislation is designed.  
This legislation is suitable if a bank has a relatively small branch in another country.  
However, the Swedish authorities cannot hold responsibility for Nordea's impact on financial stability in 
Denmark.  It  is  still  Denmark's  responsibility  that  our  financial  system  functions  –  even  if  we  do  not 
have insight into almost one quarter of the Danish banking market.  
Consequently, Danmarks Nationalbank is of the opinion that where large branches are involved that 
may affect financial stability in another member state, we need more binding cooperation between the 
authorities of the home country and the host country than EU legislation provides for.  
Both  the  supervisory  authorities  and  the  central  banks  in  the  Nordic  countries  have  concluded 
collaboration  agreements  relating  to  cross-border  financial  enterprises.  We  have  a  long-standing 
tradition for Nordic cooperation, and presumably we will be able to negotiate the necessary insight into 
large Danish branches of banks domiciled in other Nordic countries, and vice versa.  
However, the system should also be designed to handle business integration between north and south 
within  the  EU.  In  this  respect,  the  tradition  for  cooperation  is  less  well-established  than  among  the 
Nordic  countries.  It  may  therefore  be  necessary  to  rethink  the  EU  legislation  so  that  the  individual 
member states are still empowered to safeguard financial stability – even with the presence of large 
foreign branches whose operations may have an impact on the financial system. 
The  EU  needs  a  legal  handle  to  ensure  that  the  authorities of  the  host country  gain  the  necessary 
insight into a large branch of a foreign bank.  
The problem is naturally not acute, but amendments to EU legislation take their time, and we do not 
know when the need may arise. This is an issue that we will pursue in cooperation with other Danish 
authorities.
