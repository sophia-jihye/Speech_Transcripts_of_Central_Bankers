John Gieve: Uncertainty, policy and financial markets 
Speech by Sir John Gieve, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, at the Barbican Centre, 
London, 24 July 2007. 
 Introduction 
When I took on this job last year, interest rates had moved only twice in 24 months – once up 
by 25bp and once back down again. Elsewhere we had seen, both in the US and the EU, two 
years in which rates had been on a well signalled upwards path, while interest rates in Japan 
remained anchored to zero. The “Great Stability” seemed to have reached its zenith of total 
predictability.  
However,  one  of  the  things  that  struck  me  from  the  outset  in  the  MPC  was  that  the 
predictability  outside  was  not  matched  by  any  complacency  or  self  certainty  inside.  There 
was a vigorous debate underway about the state of the economy and the policy response. At 
that  stage,  some  members  of  the  committee  doubted  that  the  economy  and  employment 
would recover from the slowdown in 2005 without a further reduction in rates, while others, 
notably David Walton, saw emerging dangers on the other side. 
The economy has strengthened since then and we have had to raise interest rates 5 times in 
the last year. One thing that has not changed is the vigour of the internal debate. This is not 
(only) because economists are famously argumentative. As someone once noted, economics 
is  the  only  field  in  which  two  people  can  get  a  Nobel  prize  for  saying  opposing  things! 
Instead, the level of debate reflects genuine and unavoidable uncertainty about the economy 
which was disguised by the stability of rates but never went away. The fact is that we can 
never be sure we have interpreted the past correctly – there are always alternative plausible 
interpretations– and we know the future will contain surprises.  
I  want  to  start  today  by  discussing  that  range  of  uncertainty.  I  will  then  look  at  three 
uncertainties  affecting  financial  markets  at  the  moment:  the  losses  in  the  US  sub  prime 
market,  the  significance  of  influential  investors  including  sovereign  wealth  funds,  and  the 
state of the credit cycle.  
The range of uncertainty  
The last ten years have become known as the “Great Stability”. Certainly that has been true 
for the UK. The last quarter was the 60th of uninterrupted positive growth and it was a touch 
above  the  average  for  the  last  10  years.  On  inflation  too  we  saw  this  month  another  step 
back towards target and in 10 years we have only seen one month when the CPI has been 
more than 1 percentage point away from target (Chart 1).  
For anyone, like me, who was in the Treasury through the late 70s and 80s, this looks like 
the promised land; a degree of stability we did not think was attainable. Looking back we can 
see that it was the pains and problems of those decades culminating in being forced out of 
the ERM that produced a broad political consensus on a new approach to monetary policy 
and  the  independence  of  the  Bank.  And  my  predecessors  can  take  great  credit  for  the 
success of recent years. We have also been benefiting from benign world conditions with the 
emergence of low cost producers in the Far East and strong world GDP growth, which has 
been over 5 % in the last 3 years, the strongest 3-year period of growth since 1968-70, and 
there is every reason to hope that this benign trend will continue. 
However  it  is  important  not  to  exaggerate  this  stability  or  to  forget  the  substantial 
uncertainties that still exist. The last decade has seen some big and unanticipated changes. 
Since 1999, oil prices have risen from below $20 a barrel to over $70 a barrel, the US Fed

funds rate has varied between 1% and 6.5%, and the stock market has experienced its post 
dotcom boom, bust and recovery, with the FTSE All Share falling from its 2000 high of over 
3200 to below 1660 in 2003 before now recovering to over 3400. We have seen 9/11 and the 
onset  of  a  new  form  of  international  terrorism,  the  explosive  growth  of  new  financial 
instruments and new players to exploit them, and we have seen the emergence of China and 
India into major forces in the world economy.  
But uncertainties arise not just because there will always be unexpected events, changes of 
technology  and  taste.  We  also  continually  review  and  update  our  views  on  the  underlying 
relationships between countries, firms and people. And of course we are constantly learning 
more about the past not least as the statistics get revised.  
We try to emphasise those uncertainties by always publishing our forecasts in the form of fan 
charts which show not just a central projection but a probability distribution around it.  
If you go back a year to May 2006, our central projections for Q2 2007 were for growth of 
about 3% and inflation of around 2%. But we also showed about a one in four chance that 
growth  would  be  a  percentage  point  or  more  away  and  that  inflation  would  be  half  a 
percentage point from the central projections (Chart 2). It follows that there is also a range of 
uncertainty around the right path for interest rates. The story of the last year has been that 
growth has been stable (between 0.7 and 0.8% each quarter) and kept quite close to that 
central  projection  but  only  on  the  basis  of  substantially  higher  interest  rates  than  our 
forecasts  were  based  on;  inflation  has  been  higher  than  we  projected  again  despite  the 
successive rises in rates.  
You  might  expect  this  range  of  uncertainty  to  be  reflected  in  a  range  of  independent 
forecasts, but you would be disappointed. Most forecasters operate models much like ours 
and,  of  course,  they  use  the  same  data.  It  is  perhaps  not  a  great  surprise  then  that  their 
central  projections  tend  to  cluster  in  a  remarkably  narrow  range.  For  example,  take  the 
forecasters who were surveyed by Reuters prior to the July MPC meeting last year. At that 
point there were only two out of 47 who expected interest rates to rise above 5% by now and 
only one expected them to be below 4.25%. Fast forward to the most recent survey and you 
will see that none of the 52 expect rates to go above 6% in the next year and only two expect 
rates to go below 5.5%. To gauge the real range of uncertainty you need to look beyond the 
central forecasts at the full probability distribution of possible outcomes. The fact that most 
forecasters agree on the prospect does not mean it is likely to happen. 
Central banks need to be particularly cautious in putting weight on market expectations and 
outside forecasts because they are based at least in part on judgements about what we will 
do. In my view it is sensible for independent forecasters to assume that we will do our job 
and keep inflation low; but we can’t take comfort from the fact that most external forecasters 
therefore expect inflation to return and stay around target – its our job to justify their faith and 
keep their confidence. We must avoid chasing our own tail.  
Of course, the uncertainty of the future and of the past is a factor in our decisions on interest 
rates.  When  we  are  feeling  our  way  in  trying  to  assess  the  pressure  of  demand  in  the 
economy,  it  can  often  be  sensible  to  move  rates  gradually  so  that  we  can  gather  more 
information as we go on the effect of past rises. But, of course, we all know that if we get 
behind  the  curve,  gradualism  could  compound  the  problems.  The  pace  as  well  as  the 
direction of any change is therefore a matter for discussion in most MPC meetings.  
Looking  at  the  economy  today  there  are  as  wide  a  range  of  uncertainties  as  ever,  for 
example about the level of slack in the labour market, the pricing pressures in companies, 
the  future  path  of  oil  prices  and  the  strength  of  monetary  growth.  I  want  to  discuss  three 
which  arise  from  developments  in  financial  markets,  and  which  are  relevant  to  both  the 
Bank’s core purposes: monetary stability and financial stability.

 BIS Review 84/2007
Sub prime and the credit markets  
Let’s start with the credit markets. The backwash from defaults in the US sub prime market 
has been seen not just in the recent problems faced by some hedge funds1 exposed to this 
sector but in credit markets more widely. Credit spreads have widened especially for riskier 
bonds (Chart 3), the covenant lite loans on offer a few weeks ago are off the table, and the 
leveraged  loans  in  the  warehouses  are  reported  to  be  moving  more  slowly.  And  this  has 
happened at a time when long term interest rates have been rising.  
We have seen shocks to credit markets in the last two summers which were swiftly reversed. 
Could recent events be the beginning of a more lasting change?  
There are some good reasons for doubting it. First the underlying economic and corporate 
fundamentals remain encouraging. Not only is world growth running at over 5% but it seems 
better balanced with the recovery of Germany and Japan and slightly lower growth in the US 
(although one of the explanations for the rise in longer term risk free rates has been a more 
optimistic  view  on  US  growth  prospects).  In  the  corporate  sector  overall  gearing  is  not 
unusual,  pension  deficits  have  diminished,  and  profitability  is  high.  Defaults  in  the  prime 
housing market in the US have not shown dramatic increases. Losses on mortgage lending 
in the UK are still very low and there seems no prospect of a significant rise in unemployment 
that  led  to  sharp  rises  in  repossessions  and  defaults  in  the  past.  Equity  markets  remain 
strong at multiples of earnings which are little above average. Again, within financial markets, 
liquidity remains high overall (Chart 4).  
Against  that  background,  there  is  a  risk  of  becoming  alarmed  by  good  news.  In  our  last 
Financial Stability Report we identified the low risk premia in credit markets as the principal 
vulnerability in financial markets because of the risk it carried of a swift and disorderly return 
to more normal levels. The rise since then has not been large in a longer context (Chart 5) 
but in itself it is a healthy correction. At the same time we have seen a fall in the dollar over 
recent  months  which  should  tend  to  reduce  the  risk  of  a  sudden  correction  of  global 
imbalances, another of the key vulnerabilities we have been monitoring in recent years. 
But  the  story  of  the  sub  prime  market  is  not  yet  over  and  it  certainly  does  point  to  some 
vulnerabilities in modern financial markets which need to be factored into financial firms’ risk 
management.  
First,  this  was  a  layered  market  in  which  many  originators  had  an  incentive  to  maximise 
volumes, where the loans were then securitised and the securities were in turn combined into 
CDOs for onward distribution.  
One  risk  in  such  markets  is  that  there  is  a  loss  of  information  along  the  chain  and  that 
incentives  become  misaligned;  in  particular  the  quality  of  credit  monitoring  and  credit 
assessment declines. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that occurred in 2006 in the sub 
prime markets. Chart 6 shows the arrears on successive tranches of loans and shows that 
the quality declined over time particularly in 2005 and 2006.  
Second,  the  new  derivatives  markets  change  the  way  in  which  credit  losses  hit  balance 
sheets. In the world of on-balance-sheet lending, when defaults begin to turn up, there can 
be  scope  for  rescheduling  and  for  discussing  with  your  accountants  what  provisions  are 
prudent. We saw that impact on a few of the big banks earlier this year. In the securitised 
markets, the pace can look slower to begin with but then comes in a rush. Chart 7 shows the 
spreads  on  different  tranches  of  the  ABX  index,  the  main  benchmark  index  for  sub  prime 
securities.  What  is  remarkable  here  first  is  how  slow  the  spreads  were  to  move  at  all.  Of 
course, the predicted losses on particular tranches do no move smoothly with rising defaults, 
but  throughout  2006  the  economic  press  was  a  buzz  with  worry  about  the  US  housing

market; sentiment changed several times on whether the housing downturn would lead to a 
general recession. Throughout this period the originators continued to write new sub prime 
loans and the prices of the ABX scarcely quivered.  
But since January the story has been quite different with two dramatic hikes in the spreads 
first of BBB and then of the A-rated index. In total, the spread for BBB has gone from 500 
basis points at the turn of the year to over 3000 basis points. Each of these steps has left 
casualties. Many of the originators were forced into bankruptcy at the start of the year and in 
the last few weeks we have seen Bear Stearns’ announcement that two of its funds have lost 
all or nearly all of their investors’ money. I suspect the speed and scale of the changes were 
outside  most  stress  test  simulations.  And  while  the  most  dramatic  changes  may  have 
happened  there  will  now  be  a  long  period  as  the  implications  work  through  the  ratings  of 
other derivatives and the full range of instruments are marked to market.  
A related lesson is about liquidity in new markets. The worry has been that at times of stress, 
liquidity would dry up and it would be impossible to trade out of positions. That would not just 
lock firms into losses but would disrupt strategies which require continuous dynamic hedging 
– for example, strategies such as constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI). Again that 
has been a feature of recent weeks. It has been widely reported that a couple of the lenders 
to the BSAM funds put their collateral on the market but were not able to sell as much as 
they wanted.  
That  is  connected  to  the  fourth  lesson,  the  vulnerability  of  valuations  in  sophisticated 
derivatives.  These  are  not  widely  traded  so  valuations  are  usually  based  not  on  market 
prices  but  on  models  which  draw  in  turn  on  correlations  established  over  the  recent  past. 
This is a fundamental and unavoidable feature of new products and markets. There simply 
has not been a full cycle’s experience to draw on.  
When we published our Financial Stability Report in April we drew attention to the sub prime 
history  as  a  warning  of  what  could  go  wrong  in  bigger  and  more  central  credit  markets. 
Developments  since  then  underline  that  message.  If  some  of  the  price  moves  in  the  sub 
prime CDOs have spread to CLOs based on leveraged loans and buy-outs, that is hardly a 
surprise given recent growth in that market (Chart 8).  
There  are  signs  that  the  speed  with  which  the  pipeline  of  leveraged  deals  is  being 
warehoused has slowed down at least temporarily and the terms of some of the lending has 
tightened a little. But that said there are some significant differences between the sub prime 
and corporate loan markets. First corporate profits remain robust and there has not been the 
step up in defaults that ushered in the sub prime crisis. Second while the total size of the 
corporate  bond  market  dwarfs  the  sub  prime  mortgages  market  that  is  not  true  of  the 
leveraged corporate loan market (Chart 9). 
The weight of money – pension funds and sovereign wealth funds  
A second development in financial markets in the news at present is the growth of sovereign 
investors  and  of  “Sovereign  Wealth  Funds”  in  particular.  While  these  have  long  been 
established in Singapore, Norway and the Middle East, the decision of China with its huge 
foreign exchange reserves to diversify its investments is new. The question is what effect, if 
any, the growth of influential investors like these is having and may have in future on relative 
prices in financial markets. 
Economists  tend  to  assume  that  asset  markets  are  efficient  so  that  any  deviation  from 
fundamental value represents a profit opportunity that will be quickly eliminated through the 
actions  of  rational  traders  who  are  constantly  on  the  lookout  for  such  opportunities. 
Underpriced  assets  are  bought  while  overpriced  assets  are  sold  short,  thereby  bringing 
prices  back  in  line  with  their  fundamental  value.  In  this  way,  investment  flows  and  trading 
activity should not impact prices, unless they reflect information about the fundamentals. In 
practice the position can be more complicated.

In the UK, demand for long-term gilts from pension funds is widely thought to have had a 
significant impact especially on indexed gilt prices. Trustees have become more concerned 
in recent years to reduce the volatility of funds’ valuations, since changes now appear on the 
sponsoring  companies’  balance  sheets.  There  has  been  a  wide  move  towards  Liability 
Driven  Investment  (LDI)  and  to  matching  their  long  term  liabilities  either  by  buying  more 
index-linked bonds or by buying equivalent hedges in the derivative markets. The narrowing 
of pension fund deficits as equity markets have improved may have strengthened the trend 
since funds may now want to “lock in” the improved position. Even a relatively small shift in 
pension funds’ strategies would represent a large increase in demand relative to the size of 
the inflation-linked bond market. During 2005 and 2006, anecdotal evidence suggested that 
UK pension demand for gilts (and associated hedging by dealers) was a contributory factor in 
driving  long-horizon  sterling  nominal  and  real  interest  rates  lower.  Indeed,  this  may  have 
been  one  reason  why  UK  long-term  real  interest  rates  fell  by  more  over  this  period  than 
overseas rates. 
Assessing the impact on gilts prices is important for the Bank because we commonly use the 
differences between indexed and conventional gilts to estimate longer term market inflation 
expectations. And these calculations have shown an increase in forward inflation breakevens 
especially in the last few months as nominal long term rates have increased (Chart 10). If 
that reflects a genuine increase in investors’ expectations of future inflation in the long term 
that would imply a loss of credibility in the UK regime.  
However, there are few signs from surveys and market intelligence that UK long-run inflation 
expectations have picked up. Market contacts cite the sheer weight of institutional demand in 
the  relatively  illiquid  index-linked  gilt  market  as  a  more  likely  explanation  why  the  price  of 
long-dated index-linked gilts has not fallen by  as much as conventional bonds over recent 
months.  
The  comparisons  are  complicated  by  the  fact  that  the  measure  of  inflation  that  is  used  to 
index gilts is the RPI while our target is set for the CPI and the gap, which largely reflects the 
impact of interest rates and house prices on the RPI is significant, is about 0.7% on average 
and  variable  (Chart  11).  But  even  making  an  adjustment  for  that,  the  rise  in  inflation 
breakevens is significant.  
Of course, if inflation at long horizons is not generally expected to increase as the forward 
rates at face value might indicate, why don’t some other investors with different risk appetites 
sell  short  the  overpriced  index-linked  bond?  One  answer  may  be  that  there  are  significant 
market frictions. For example, trading long-horizon forward inflation requires an investment 
period of many years, over which market volatility must be endured, and most speculative 
players have significantly shorter investment horizons. Second, transaction costs (bid-offer) 
are typically higher in index-linked than conventional instruments, partly because the risks in 
holding inventory are not predictable and are not easily hedged.2
It may be that, against the background of more volatile realised inflation over the past year 
the  rise  in  breakeven  inflation  rates  reflects  an  increase  in  inflation  risk  premia,  the 
compensation  required  to  bear  unexpected  changes  in  future  inflation.  And  the  marginal 
buyers  of  index-linked  bonds  (typically  insurance  companies  and  pension  funds)  have 
become  more  willing  to  pay  a  premium  for  these  assets  because  they  better  match  their 
liabilities. Rather like entering into an insurance contract, these investors may be willing to 
pay a higher price for index-linked securities because the payoffs may be received in states 
of the world when they are most valued. Such institutional factors probably account for some 
                                                 
2   Partly because of the strength of this institutional demand (and their tendency to buy bonds then hold them to 
maturity), inflation-linked markets are significantly less liquid than their nominal counterparts. DMO data show 
that as a proportion of the market capitalisation of bonds outstanding, turnover in the IG market is about 1/6th 
that of the conventional gilt market.

part  of  the  measured  rise  in  forward  inflation  rates.  Nonetheless  the  stability  of  inflation 
expectations will remain a key concern for the MPC.  
Sovereign Investors 
In a global context, another influential set of investors in financial markets over recent years 
have  been  holders  of  official  foreign  exchange  reserves  and  Sovereign  Wealth  Funds 
(SWFs). A by-product of large current account surpluses, the funds available for investment 
have ballooned over the past few years – foreign assets held by sovereigns globally currently 
stand  at  US$7-8  trillion,  of  which  around  US$5  ½  trillion  is  held  as  international  reserves. 
This is around 5 times higher than the level seen in the early 1990s, and could well be an 
understatement. The growth in foreign assets has been particularly rapid in Asian countries 
(especially China) and oil and gas exporting economies, including Russia (Chart 12). 
It is difficult to be precise about the size of SWFs because they are not recorded explicitly in 
most official statistics. But recent estimates suggest that their foreign assets are in the range 
of $2 –2 ½ trillion and they are rising rapidly.  
There  is  no  consensus  on  the  effects  that  this  recycling  of  foreign  exchange  reserves  is 
having on global financial markets. The market for US Treasuries is exceptionally deep and 
liquid, but with foreign official investors3 accounting in aggregate for around 30% of the total 
US  Treasury  debt  market,  some  academic  studies  suggest  that  they  may  have  kept  the 
nominal yield on the 10-year US Treasury a hundred basis points lower than they would have 
been otherwise.4
The perception that official buyers may well have different aims and risk appetites to other 
commercial  investors  could  give  them  more  influence  in  the  markets.  And,  as  with  UK 
pension funds, they may genuinely alter the risk and term premia in some markets. 
Within these accumulating reserves, the growth of SWFs will alter, at least at the margin, the 
asset mix of official balance sheets. Over time that will tend to increase the price of riskier 
assets,  like  equities  and  corporate  and  emerging  market  bonds,  compared  to  government 
bonds. The impact will be greater if there are concentrations of investment in particular asset 
classes or countries. More widely, the switch of reserve rich countries from lenders to owners 
of  financial  or  real  assets  is  also  likely  to  lead  to  political  tensions  and  pressures  for 
protectionism.  
The credit cycle and monetary policy  
The knock on effects of defaults in the US sub prime market and the impact of big investors 
on asset prices are factors we need to assess not just in trying to understand the financial 
sector and the stresses it faces but in gauging the state of the economy more widely.  
The story of the sub prime market illustrates a wider point. In traditional banking markets in 
the past there has been an observable tendency for banks to overshoot both in offering credit 
at the top of the cycle and retrenching afterwards. That feeds through into asset prices and 
can  have  an  impact  on  the  wider  economy.  Despite  the  sophistication  of  the  new  capital 
markets, a very traditional cycle seems to have been alive and kicking in sub prime.  
                                                 
3   The  definition  of  the  official  sector  in  the  US  Treasury  survey  also  includes  public  bodies  such  as  oil 
stabilisation funds.

 BIS Review 84/2007
A similar story could be told about the credit card and other unsecured lending over the last 
few years. The growth rate rose in the late 90s until defaults began to build up over the last 2 
years and the banks and other lenders tightened up terms and conditions sharply (Chart 13). 
The  path  of  commercial  property  prices  in  recent  years  suggests  the  same  has  been 
happening there (Chart 14).  
In both cases there were genuine and lasting changes in technology and the costs of supply 
as the development of IT improved credit scoring and allowed the distribution of securitised 
risk to a wider range of investors. However, there are clear signs, at least in unsecured credit 
for  households,  that  the  lenders  overshot.  It  seems  likely  that  something  similar  has  been 
going on in some leveraged loan deals. The position in the biggest markets – the mortgage 
market and mainstream corporate lending – are less clear.  
How far recent growth rates in money supply and in asset prices reflect a credit supply cycle 
and, if so, where we are in the cycle are questions we have been discussing on the MPC. If 
we could be confident of the answers there would be a strong case for using monetary policy 
to help stabilise growth and inflation by “leaning into the wind” – that is, raising rates a little 
faster  or  further  than  we  would  otherwise  have  done  on  the  upswing  and  reducing  them 
quicker on the down swing. In practice the diagnosis is rarely clear cut. The sub prime losses 
and the impact of large investors are two factors complicating matters at the moment. 
Conclusion 
The old Chinese curse – “may he live in interesting times” – might be designed for central 
bankers. Our job is to keep things stable and boring. But there are limits in a rapidly changing 
world  to  what  is  possible.  My  argument  is  that  the  uncertainties  today  are  a  return  to 
normality after two years of exceptional predictability in monetary policy both in the UK and 
elsewhere.  
A particular area of uncertainty at present is in the credit markets. The dangers of combining 
a traditional credit cycle with the new derivatives markets have emerged in the US sub prime 
sector. The US housing market is in its downswing and there are some signs that the same 
is true in the UK of unsecured credit and commercial property. The position of the bigger UK 
sectors  is  less  clear  cut.  The  shift  in  pension  fund  priorities  and  the  growth  of  sovereign 
wealth funds are further clouding the picture. 
It is our job on the MPC to work through these issues and reach a judgement on them. Our 
target is to reduce inflation to 2% and keep it there. I can assure you that we will do whatever 
is needed to achieve that.
