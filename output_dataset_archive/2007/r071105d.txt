Thomas Jordan: Monetary policy in a climate of increased uncertainty 
Summary of a speech by Mr Thomas Jordan, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss 
National Bank, at the SNB Money Market Event, Geneva, 1 November 2007. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 Uncertainty about the extent and distribution of losses from US “subprime” mortgages has 
resulted  in  a  marked  squeeze  on  financial  markets.  In  particular,  there  is  considerable 
uncertainty concerning the true valuation of securitised assets and structured products based 
on subprime mortgages. Demand for liquidity has surged. In certain instances, the crisis of 
confidence among financial market participants was so pronounced that some markets did 
not  function  at  all.  The  “re-pricing  of  risk”  has  caused  risk  premia  for  most  financial 
instruments to soar. 
Risk premia are important for the Swiss National Bank (SNB) for two reasons. On the one 
hand, they act as economic signals and should therefore be as unbiased as possible in the 
way  they  reflect  underlying  risks.  In  addition,  there  are  certain  risks  attached  to  extreme 
values of risk premia. Abrupt and uncontrolled corrections could lead to instability on financial 
markets and interfere with their smooth functioning. On the other hand, risk premia affect the 
restrictiveness of monetary policy. An increase in such premia tightens monetary policy. The 
SNB  monetary  policy  concept,  where  the  three-month  Libor  is  at  the  centre  of  the 
implementation of monetary policy, takes systematic account of changes in risk premia.
