John Gieve: Sovereign wealth funds and global imbalances 
Speech  by  Sir  John  Gieve,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  England,  to  the  Sovereign 
Wealth Management Conference, London, 14 March 2008. 
 Introduction 
Much of the debate on sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) has focused on political questions: do 
they reintroduce the failings of public ownership into market economies by the back door, will 
SWFs  use  their  ownership  rights  to  pursue  political  ends,  and  will  resistance  to  foreign 
ownership  lead  to  a  new  wave  of  protectionism.  I  want  to  concentrate  today  on  some 
economic  issues:  why  have  they  become  so  prominent  recently,  how  does  that  relate  to 
imbalances in the world economy, how are they affecting financial markets and what are the 
policy implications of their growth.  
Background 
But first let me set out some of the background. 
There  is  no  off  the  shelf  definition  of  an  SWF.  What  I  have  in  mind  is  a  government 
investment  vehicle  that  manages  foreign  assets  with  a  higher  risk  tolerance  and  higher 
expected returns than for central bank foreign currency reserves.1 The size of such funds is 
hard to measure, but may be in the $2-3 trillion range. 
Origins of SWFs 
Investments by SWFs are one type of capital flow between countries so they have always 
been  closely  related  to  global  imbalances  in  trade.  When  countries  run  surpluses  on  their 
current account, they generate equal and opposite net capital outflows of one sort or another 
and those capital flows produce an investment income.  
That  has  been  the  story  of  the  UK  economy  over  the  last  150  years.  We  ran  continuous 
surpluses in the 50 years before the first world war (Chart 1) and built up a large stock of 
foreign  assets.  Partly  as  a  result  of  that,  we  benefited  from  a  surplus  on  our  investment 
account for most of the period since the 1870s.  
There are two key differences between that period of the UK’s investment abroad and the 
situation today. 100 years ago the developed countries were investing in emerging markets 
(at the time in the Americas and Australia) which had abundant land and natural resources 
but  scarce  capital  and  so  the  returns  were  high.  Currently,  capital  is  flowing  “uphill”  from 
emerging  to  mature  economies.  Secondly,  the  investors  before  were  mainly  in  the  private 
sector and were seeking out the best returns on capital. Today the investors are mainly EME 
central  banks  and  governments  and  the  build  up  of  foreign  assets  reflects  their  policy 
choices.  
                                                 
1   There  is  some  fuzziness  at  the  edges  of  this  definition.  Central  bank  reserves  in  some  countries,  which 
traditionally  have  been  invested  mainly  in  liquid  and  safe  instruments,  are  increasingly  being  switched  into 
riskier  assets.  Also,  in  some  countries,  state-owned  banks  and  companies  invest  in  foreign  assets  where 
some of the policy issues are the same as for sovereign wealth funds.

Modern sovereign wealth funds are not new, in fact the first – the Kuwait Investment Office – 
was set up here in London in February 1953 – just as Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay 
were setting out to climb Everest.2 And the number of funds has been increasing since then 
like the traffic on the slopes of Everest.  
The next wave were set up by other oil producers after the price increases in the 70s and 
80s for persuasive reasons (Chart 2). First oil is a non-renewable resource so it can make 
sense  for  governments  to  spread  the  benefits  of  this  endowment  across  generations  by 
investing part of today’s income in assets that will provide an income tomorrow. That would 
be so even if the path of oil prices was predictable but in fact it is not. That uncertainty about 
future income provides a second case for saving today. In the late 1970s, some oil exporters 
increased spending to match higher incomes and faced a painful adjustment when prices fell 
back  again.  Third,  even  if  the  rise  in  income  was  permanent  there  would  be  a  case  for 
phasing  the  growth  of  domestic  spending  and  investment  to  prevent  supply  bottlenecks 
leading to inflation.  
Recent growth of SWFs 
Since the millennium at least 10 new SWFs have been set up and there are reports of plans 
for more for example in Brazil, Japan and India. 
This reflects the remarkable shift of emerging-market economies from debtors to creditors. 
Ten years ago – at the time of the Asian crisis – emerging markets as a whole were running 
a  current  account  deficit.  Since  then  they  have  been  running  progressively  bigger  current 
account surpluses reaching an estimated $685 billion last year (1.3 % of world GDP).3 The 
counterpart to this is that developed countries as a group have been running progressively 
bigger  current  account  deficits  not  just  in  the  United  States  but  also  in  a  number  of  other 
developed countries including the UK.4 Of course there are some notable exceptions in each 
group: Canada, Japan and Germany for example are still creditors while many countries in 
central and eastern Europe and Africa are running large deficits. But maps 1 and 2 show how 
much the pattern has changed in the last 10 years. Most of South America and South East 
Asia have swung from deficit to surplus. Perhaps as important, the scale of the differences 
has grown with more countries running surpluses or deficits of over 5% of GDP. 
Oil and other commodity inflation is part of the story, of course, but that does not account for 
the large current surpluses in most of East Asia. Here strong manufacturing growth resulting 
from  higher  labour  productivity  has  not  been  matched  by  higher  domestic  spending  so 
savings  have  grown  ahead  of  even  dramatic  investment  growth.  A  deliberate  policy  of 
fostering export industrial growth has slowed the rise of exchange rates that would reduce 
these imbalances. 
As  a  result  the  build-up  in  EME  foreign  assets  have  been  held  mainly  as  central  bank 
reserves especially in Asian countries (Chart 3). In total the foreign assets now held by EME 
central  banks  and  governments  is  about  $7  trillion  dollars,  which  compares  with  only  $60 
billion  gross  foreign  assets  held  by  the  UK  government.  Many  emerging  economies 
concluded  after  the  Asian  crisis  a  decade  ago  that  they  needed  bigger  liquid  reserves  in 
traditional government debt to defend themselves against volatility in financial markets even 
when that carried the likelihood of a negative return (taking account of expected exchange

The Kuwait Investment Office is the in-house investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Authority (formerly 
known as the Kuwait Investment Board) and was established by Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah on 
23 February 1953.  Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reached the summit on 29 May 1953. 
These figures include the NICs. Excluding NICs the estimated surplus is $596 billion (1.1%). 
Latest data show that current account deficits were 5% of GDP or above not only in the United States but 
also in Spain, Greece, Portugal, Australia, New Zealand, UK and Iceland.

rate movements). But when the reserves outstripped the levels needed for that purpose, it 
was  natural  to  look  to  increase  the  returns  on  investment  by  widening  the  range  of 
investments.5  
And in the next few years, these current account surpluses are likely to remain high and the 
build  up  of  foreign  assets  by  governments  in  oil  exporting  and  Asian  countries  is  likely  to 
continue. According to the IMF’s forecasts, the combined current account surplus of China 
and  oil-exporting  countries  will  be  around  $800  billion  over  the  next  3  years.  And the 
IMF estimates that sovereign wealth fund assets could grow to $6-10 trillion within the next 5 
years.  
The impact of SWFs on financial markets 
These are huge numbers and SWFs have become prominent and important players in many 
financial markets. But we should not exaggerate their impact on the global financial system. 
In aggregate, their assets under management are currently only less than one-twentieth of 
those  held  by  private  sector  participants  such  as  pension,  insurance  and  mutual  funds  as 
well as hedge funds and private equity (Chart 4). And they account for about 2% of the total 
size  of  equity  and  bond  markets  globally.  Even  in  five  years  time  –  and  on  some  of  the 
fastest  growth  projections  –  assets  under  management  by  sovereign  wealth  funds  are 
projected  to  reach  only  about  6%  of  global  financial  assets.6  Moreover,  though  they  have 
more assets under management than hedge funds they have smaller investments since they 
are not leveraged.7  
It is not difficult to identify positive effects on the world’s capital markets. Sovereign wealth 
funds have long investment horizons and generally have no commercial liabilities. Therefore, 
in periods of market stress they are likely to face less pressure than most private investors to 
reduce the size or increase the liquidity of their investments. They are well placed to play a 
contrarian  role  and  help  to  stabilise  markets  by  investing  in  times  of  stress.  For  example, 
when  the  global  equity  market  fell  sharply  between  2000  and  2002,  the  Norwegian 
Government Pension Fund was a large buyer of global equities. And a number of sovereign 
wealth  funds  have  played  an  important  and  welcome  stabilising  role  during  the  current 
turmoil by providing around $40 billion of new capital since November to some of the world’s 
biggest commercial and investment banks (Table 1).8  
Taking a broader view, the switch of some reserves from government debt into SWFs which 
invest in a wider range of instruments should help to improve the allocation of resources if 
these investments are based on commercial criteria. Investing in equities may also help to 
reinforce  and  bring  to  the  surface  the  common  interest  that  EMEs  and  the  advanced 
economies have in the good performance of the companies involved and the markets they 
operate in. It may thus help to integrate EMEs into the global financial system and encourage 
them to participate more in global policy making.  
 From a parochial point of view, the prospective increase in demand for equities relative to 
bonds could have a positive impact on London and sterling. Whereas the value of the UK 
                                                 
5   Foreign  reserves  held  by  EME  central  banks  as  a  whole  are  about  60%  (close  to  $3  trillion)  higher  than 
needed for conventional precautionary reasons to cover short-term external debt.

7   That said, the assets held by sovereign wealth funds are highly concentrated, with around 70% of total assets 
held by the five largest funds. So the largest sovereign wealth funds could have an impact on some markets 
especially smaller ones such as other EMEs. 
8   Also, a number of central banks from countries with large current account deficits have been willing throughout 
the current liquidity crisis to lend to international banks, including UK ones, at longer, three-to-twelve month, 
maturities.

market for public debt securities is only 3.3% of the global market, UK equities account for 
7½% of the value of global equities. The rapid growth in sovereign wealth funds is also a fillip 
for London as a leading international financial centre.  
SWFs and transparency 
The main doubts concern their objectives and how far their investments will be driven only by 
financial returns. 
Public sector owners might have other objectives including national political interests, such 
as, accessing military technology, controlling strategic resources or markets, and influencing 
public opinion.9 There are often complaints that sovereign wealth funds lack transparency. 
Decoded, this is a request for reassurance about their investment policies.  
I am certainly not going to argue against more transparency (except in the very special case 
of the market operations of central banks). More openness from SWFs may help to alleviate 
concerns  in  recipient  countries  –  and  thus  reduce  protectionist  pressures.  And  it  may 
improve the dissemination of information to market participants and to their own citizens. I 
know many SWFs are working with the IMF to produce a voluntary code of conduct that is 
based on best practices for the governance and transparency of sovereign wealth funds. For 
example, it would be helpful if all sovereign wealth funds were transparent about their overall 
strategies, objectives and broad investment guidelines. Norway’s Government Pension Fund 
is a good example in this respect.  
But  there  should  be  a  level  playing  field  applied  to  all  investors.  The  case  for  greater 
transparency applies to other investors too. SWFs may take some comfort that they are not 
being singled out and that there are equally powerful pressures for transparency on hedge 
funds  and  private  equity  investors.  In  this  respect,  two  recent  initiatives  are  particularly 
welcome. First, a report under the chairmanship of Sir Andrew Large – my predecessor as 
Deputy Governor for Financial Stability at the Bank – on voluntary standards, including on 
disclosure, for hedge funds. And, second, a report by Sir David Walker – a former Executive 
Director  of  the  Bank  –  on  guidelines  for  disclosure  and  transparency  by  private  equity 
funds.10  
And transparency should not be one sided among countries. I know SWFs themselves are 
often keen for more transparency from recipient countries on whether and how far they are 
welcome and the rules of engagement. 
The UK in recent years has been unusually open to foreign investors and foreign ownership 
both in comparison to our past and in comparison to most other developed (and emerging) 
countries today. We have relied on regulation of infrastructure industries and on competition 
law  to  prevent  the  abuse  of  market  power  and  most  of  our  utilities,  much  of  the  financial 
sector, as well as an increasing number of our leading football clubs have come into foreign 
ownership. In its latest survey of international direct investment trends, the OECD ranked the 
UK as having one of the least restrictive regulatory environment for foreign direct investment 
across all OECD member countries (Chart 5). And the UK has welcomed a number of SWFs 
to London as a base for international operations.  
                                                 
9   Note though that this distinction between foreign public and private sector owners is not cut and dried. Foreign 
private  sector  purchases  of  football  teams  or  newspapers  do  not  always  seem  to  be  driven  by  the  profit 
motive.

of best practice standards for hedge funds in terms of disclosure, valuation, risk, governance and shareholder 
conduct. The Walker Report recommends a set of guidelines for disclosure and transparency by private equity 
funds, including the publication of regular information on their financing, ownership and prospects.

 BIS Review 31/2008
Sovereign wealth funds and global imbalances 
However,  the  emphasis  on  transparency  and  the  politics  of  SWFs  risks  missing  a  bigger 
policy issue: the recent rapid growth in SWFs reflects large and persistent global imbalances 
which  are  a  continuing  threat  to  the  stability  of  the  world  financial  system  and  the  global 
economy.  
Global imbalances and financial crises 
While there are many examples of countries which have run deficits for many years such as 
Australia and New Zealand, history also shows how painful the eventual adjustment can be. 
There are many examples in which capital flight has resulted in a huge fall in GDP growth 
and broader financial crises – for example in Latin America in the early 1980s, in the Nordic 
countries in the early 1990s and the east Asian economies a decade ago – which, in turn, 
weakened global GDP growth or global financial institutions.  
Countries with large deficits are vulnerable to a rapid reversal of capital flows. If investors are 
no longer willing to finance the deficit, domestic spending will need to be cut relative to output 
through a combination of reducing spending and switching production to the tradable sector. 
A recent IMF study reviewed 42 episodes of large reductions in current account deficits in 
developed  countries  over  the  past 40  years.  In  a  quarter  of  the  cases,  which  were  mainly 
countries  with  limited  real  exchange  rate  depreciation,  annual  GDP  growth  fell  by  3½ 
percentage points on average.11  
There are dangers too for surplus countries. Large foreign exchange inflows are not easy to 
sterilise. They tend to contribute to asset price bubbles and higher inflation which itself can 
undermine  economic  and  financial  stability.  The  effect  of  such  inflows  into  China  and  oil-
exporting countries have been compounded recently by their exchange rates being pegged 
or managed against the falling dollar. This has contributed not just to the build up of reserves 
and SWFs but also to the build up of inflationary pressures within these countries.  
No one would blame EMEs for the current turmoil in Western financial markets. It has been 
generated  at  home  by  the  widespread  mispricing  of  financial  assets;  this  has  been  most 
obvious  among  the  assets  based  on  the  US  housing  market  but  it  is  not  confined  to  that 
sector. However the way that the boom developed did owe a great deal to global imbalances.  
The  “savings  glut”,  to  quote  Ben  Bernanke12,  that  developed  in  the  oil  exporting  countries 
and China contributed to the fall in real long-term interest rates.13 In the UK, for example, real 
long-term  interest  rates,  measured  by  the  difference  between  the  nominal  10-year 
government bond yield and the annual rate of inflation, fell from around 3.9% in 1997 to 1.6% 
in 2005. A similar pattern was also evident in the US (Chart 6). In particular, interest rates on 
safe  assets  fell  since  the  build  up  in  foreign  assets  were  invested  mainly  in  government 
bonds.14 That both discouraged saving and boosted asset prices. In order to maintain their 
traditional returns, the private sector sought higher yielding strategies and were too ready to

Bundesbank Lecture, Berlin, and Bernanke, B (2005) "The Global Savings Glut and the U.S. Current Account 
Deficit", speech delivered for the Sandridge Lecture at the Virginia Association of Economists. 
13   A fall in desired investment (investment ‘strike’) in some countries also contributed to the decline in global real 
interest  rates.  For  example,  investment-GDP  ratios  fell  sharply  in  the  Newly  Industrialised  Countries  in  the 
wake of the east Asian crisis a decade ago. 
14 For example FE Warnock and VC Warnock (2006) (‘International Capital Flows and US interest rates’, NBER 
Working  Paper,  12560)  estimate  that  foreign  official  flows  reduced  US  10-year  Treasury  nominal  yields  by 
about 100 basis points lower than otherwise in the year to June 2005.

believe that these could be attained through new products without running bigger risks. We 
are now dealing with the consequences of that mistake. 
Global imbalances – where to from here 
Looking  forward,  the  unwinding  of  global  imbalances  requires  some  combination  of  a 
slowdown in the growth of domestic demand in deficit countries and an increase in domestic 
demand in surplus countries. If the slowdown is not to dominate, we need to see a shift in 
relative prices to rebalance demand – that is a gradual real exchange rate depreciation of 
deficit countries against surplus ones. 
The rise of SWFs may play a part in this dynamic. Their emergence is a sign that surplus 
countries may be less willing in future to accept such low yielding assets. That should put 
pressure on exchange rates to adjust and contribute to a reduction in global imbalances. So 
while  SWFs  may  be  a  product  of  global  imbalances,  they  may  also  play  a  part  in  the 
adjustment.  
There are signs that in the United States, at least, imbalances are beginning to adjust. The 
US current account deficit now looks past its peak and the marked fall in the dollar – about 
25%  in  real  traded-weighted  terms  –  since  its  peak  in  early  2002  should  help  in  the 
adjustment.  However,  the  decline  in  US  relative  demand  is  coming  about  mainly  through 
slower domestic demand growth at home rather than faster demand growth abroad while the 
dollar has fallen less against currencies with the largest current account surpluses (Chart 7). 
There is a risk, therefore, that the fall in the US current deficit will not be matched by a fall of 
surpluses  in  high  surplus  countries  but  a  rise  in  deficits  in  other  deficit  countries.  The 
imbalances could be transferred not reduced. 
So it is important that the current large gap between savings and investment in the Far East 
and oil exporting countries narrows. In the near term, the ability to increase spending will be 
constrained  by  the  recent  increase  in  inflationary  pressures  in  these  countries.  But  more 
exchange rate flexibility should be helpful on both fronts. And over the medium-term, in oil 
exporting  countries,  government  spending  is  likely  to  increase  further  in  response  to  past 
increases in incomes since part of the rise in the oil price looks to be permanent. This gives 
oil exporters the opportunity to spend more on diversifying production in their economies. It is 
encouraging also that in China the government has plans to increase its own expenditure on 
the infrastructure, encourage higher spending by households through speeding up financial 
sector reform and improving the safety net as well as allowing more flexibility than in the past 
in the exchange rate. 
Conclusion 
Given  the  growth of the  foreign  currency  reserves  in many  EMEs,  the  emergence  of 
SWFs making long term investments on financial criteria in a wider range of instruments is a 
positive development. Some increase in the transparency both of the strategy and objectives 
of  the  funds  and  of  recipient  countries’  approach  to  inward  investment  should  help  dispel 
concerns  and  ensure  they  are  a  force  for  greater global  financial  integration  rather  than a 
prompt  for  a  new wave  of  financial  protectionism.  SWF’s  recent  investments  in  global 
financial institutions have been helpful in easing the current financial market turmoil. And the 
fact  that  they,  and  their  central  banks,  are  looking  for  higher  returns  and  greater  asset 
diversification should be beneficial both to the EMEs and to the recipient countries since it 
should improve the efficiency of global asset allocation.  
But  that  positive  story  should  not  conceal  that  the  growth  of  SWFs  is  also  a  result  of 
persistent global imbalances in trade. These imbalances have helped create vulnerabilities in 
financial markets and in the wider economy. Our current experience is one more illustration 
of how painful the unwinding of such imbalances can be.
