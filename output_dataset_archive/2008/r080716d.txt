Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Enhancing SMEs’ awareness on access to financing 
Keynote address by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the 
Banking  Industry  Seminar  “Enhancing  SMEs'  Awareness  on  Access  to  Financing”,  Kuala 
Lumpur, 9 July 2008. 
 Introduction  
It is my pleasure to be here this morning to speak at this seminar, to enhance greater SME 
awareness on access to financing organised by the Association of Banks in Malaysia. The 
development of a strong and dynamic SME sector is a priority on the national agenda. It is 
part of the efforts towards creating sustainable and balanced economic growth. The reasons 
for  this  are  clear.  SMEs  account  for  99%  of  the  total  business  establishments  in  Malaysia 
and for 56% of total employment and contribute about 32% to gross domestic product and 
19% of total exports of the nation.  
Over the recent five years, SMEs have also increased their contribution to growth. In several 
developed  countries,  SMEs  contribute  at  least  half  of  the  gross  domestic  product.  Taking 
SMEs in these economies as a benchmark, there is clearly significant potential for SMEs in 
Malaysia to increase their contribution to the economy.  
My remarks today will focus on three areas. Firstly, the implications of global economic and 
financial  developments  on  the  Malaysian  economy,  and  in  particular  on  businesses  and 
SMEs. Secondly, on the strategy adopted by the Government and Bank Negara Malaysia to 
develop  the  potential  of  the  SME  sector  as  a  source  of  economic  growth.  And  finally,  the 
further measures that need to be implemented by the banking institutions and the SMEs in a 
more challenging environment of rising costs.  
Economic and financial developments  
Going forward, the international economic and financial environment is expected to remain 
challenging  with  slower  global  growth  and  continued  uncertainties  in  the  international 
financial  markets.  The  moderation  in  global  growth  is  also  occurring  in  an  environment  of 
increasing inflation arising from the higher energy and commodity prices.  
The Malaysian economy has been on a steady growth path averaging about 6% in the recent 
three years. In 2007, the economy expanded by 6.3% and has continued to register a strong 
growth  in  the  first  half  of  2008.  This  stronger  growth  has  been  achieved  despite  the  more 
challenging  external  environment  and  increased  uncertainties  in  the  international  financial 
markets.  
One  of  the  important  contributing  factors  has  been  the  successful  transformation  of  the 
Malaysian  economy  in  this  recent  decade  which  has  resulted  in  a  more  balanced  and 
diversified growth, in which the services and agriculture sectors have become increasingly 
more important drivers of growth. In addition, domestic demand has a more significant role in 
driving the growth. The stronger domestic demand and growth in the services and agriculture 
sectors have benefited the SME sector since the majority of the SMEs are operating in these 
sectors.  
However,  the  rising  international  prices  of  energy  and  commodities  have  confronted 
economies  globally  with  rising  costs  and  intensifying  inflationary  pressures.  This  has 
prompted several emerging economies to restructure their fuel subsidies in an effort to create 
more  efficient  economies  and  to  achieve  more  sustainable  fiscal  positions.  This  has  been 
followed by the consequent adjustments in consumer prices as the gap between international 
market  prices  and  domestic  prices  narrow.  In  Malaysia  ,  petrol  prices  were  adjusted  by 
BIS Review 90/2008

40.6%  while  diesel  prices  by  63.3%.  This  adjustment  would  be  reflected  in  the  consumer 
price inflation in June, which is expected to exceed 6%. Beginning 1 July, electricity tariffs 
have  also  been  raised  by  up  to  18%  for  households  and  an  average  of  26%  for  some 
commercial and industry users. While domestic inflation is expected to remain elevated for 
the remaining part of this year and early next year, it is expected to moderate in the second 
half of 2009.  
In the current international environment, the policy response needs to be contextualised to 
the  conditions  prevailing  in  each  individual  economy.  In  those  economies  that  are 
experiencing overheating and strong demand conditions, there is greater clarity in terms of 
the  need  for  policy  to  rein  in  demand.  However,  for  economies  that  are  experiencing 
moderating  growth,  the  risks  to  growth  and  inflation  need  to  be  carefully  evaluated.  In 
addition,  consideration  needs  to  be  given  to  the  deflationary  impact  of  the  fuel  price 
increases on consumption. Trends in consumption and the conditions in the labour market 
will provide signs of potential second round effects following rising costs and the extent to 
which a generalised price increases are occurring.  
In such an environment, SMEs need to consider repositioning of business strategies and to 
find  new  markets  and  avenues  of  growth.  Reengineering  of  processes  would  also  be 
required to better manage the higher cost conditions. The key is for the SMEs to use their 
inherent flexibility and agility to create new products and reorient the business. Given that the 
current inflationary pressures is a global phenomenon, with many of our trading partners and 
neighbors having similar or higher inflation rates, the inflation is unlikely to erode Malaysia's 
comparative advantage.  
In this more challenging economic environment, sustaining growth will also require concerted 
efforts by the public and private sectors to reduce costs and become more efficient and more 
productive.  To  assist  SME  businesses  in  this  environment,  the  Government  has  recently 
established a Special Committee to recommend potential measures to reduce the impact of 
rising  costs  on  SMEs.  The  measures  to  be  announced  later  this  month  are  aimed  at 
enhancing  efficiency  and  productivity  of  SMEs,  reducing  the  cost  of  doing  business  and 
ensuring that SMEs have sustainable access to financing.  
The SME development agenda  
In  view  of  the  important  role  of  SMEs  in  the  economy,  the  Government  has  accorded 
significant  emphasis  on  the  development  and  strengthening  the  SME  sector.  Culminating 
from the recommendations of the National SME Steering Committee, the Government took a 
landmark  decision  in  June  2004  to  establish  the  National  SME  Development  Council.  The 
Council,  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister  and  supported  by  Bank  Negara  Malaysia  as  the 
Secretariat,  provides  policy  direction  for  the  programmes  to  support  the  development  of 
SMEs,  and  to  ensure  the  effective coordination  and  implementation  of  these  programmes. 
Currently,  members  of  the  Council  comprise  of  the  Prime  Minister,  15  Ministers  and  four 
Heads of Agencies, that are involved in SME development.  
Since the establishment of the Council in 2004, the national SME strategy has focused on 
the development of high performing and resilient SMEs by capacity building and providing an 
enabling environment for the SMEs. The measures undertaken have been clustered under 
three  broad  strategic  thrusts,  namely,  strengthening  the  enabling  infrastructure;  enhancing 
the capacity and capability of SMEs; and enhancing access to financing. The basic principle 
adopted has been to help SMEs to help themselves.  
An annual SME Blueprint Management Framework has been implemented to ensure more 
focused,  holistic  and  effective  SME  development  programmes  with  greater  collaboration 
between the Ministries and Agencies involved. In 2007, more than 286,000 SMEs received 
assistance  through  the  implementation  of  189  key  development  programmes,  involving 
2 
 BIS Review 90/2008
expenditure  of  RM4.9  billion.  For  2008,  198  key  programmes  are  being  implemented, 
involving an expenditure of RM3.2 billion.  
With the foundations now in place, on 2 June 2008 the Council announced the formation of 
the  SME  Central  Coordinating  Agency  to  further  build  on  the  successes  that  have  been 
achieved and to take the SME sector to the next stage of development. This dedicated SME 
Agency  represents  a  major  structural  enhancement  in  the  SME  development  agenda  and 
marks  another  milestone  for  SME  development  in  Malaysia.  The  Small  and  Medium 
Industries  Development  Corporation  or  SMIDEC,  will  be  transformed  and  repositioned  to 
undertake this role. This new entity, that will be known as the SME Corporation Malaysia or 
SME Corp, will be a one-stop agency that undertakes the overall coordination of SME policy 
formulation and assessment of the SME development programmes. The SME Corp will serve 
as the central point of information, reference and advisory services for SMEs for all sectors 
and  will  assume  the  role  of  Secretariat  to  the  Council,  a  role  which  has  until  now  been 
undertaken by Bank Negara Malaysia. 
Increasing SME access to financing  
Bank Negara Malaysia's own efforts have been focused on ensuring that SMEs, at different 
stages  of  the  business  life  cycle,  have  adequate  access  to  financing.  The  initiatives  have 
been  directed  at  four  broad  areas.  Firstly,  the  strengthening  of  financial  service  providers. 
This has involved strengthening the role of the banking institutions in providing financing to 
SMEs. This recent five years have seen the financial institutions accord greater focus to the 
SME sector. We have also seen a paradigm shift in the approach by financial institutions in 
the business of SME financing. Increasingly, banks have introduced strategies for interfacing 
with SME customers, evolving new business cultures for the SME segment and enhancing 
the financial products and services offered to the SME industry. The share of SME financing 
has increased from 30% of the total business financing of banking institutions in 1999 to 44% 
at end-May 2008.  
In  addition,  a  sustainable  and  comprehensive  Microfinance  Institutional  Framework  was 
implemented in 2006. Since its implementation, there has been considerable progress in the 
participation  of  financial  institutions  in  providing  microfinance.  Currently,  nine  financial 
institutions  have  launched  microfinance  products,  which  has  helped  to  increase  access  to 
financing  to  micro-enterprises.  The  outstanding  micro-financing  now  amount  to  RM325 
million with more than 31,000 customers.  
In  addition,  the  financial  service  providers  such  as  the  Credit  Guarantee  Corporation  and 
Bank Pertanian Malaysia, now known as Agro Bank, have been transformed into institutions 
that are more effective, efficient and financially sustainable. In relation to this, the SME Credit 
Bureau, a key initiative under the transformation plan of the CGC has officially commenced 
operations on 1 July 2008. The Bureau serves as a source of reliable credit information for 
both the SMEs and their potential financiers. The Bureau will assist SMEs to build a track 
record and thereby enhance access to financing on more favourable terms, leading to faster 
decisions on loan applications, and providing a balanced profile of the credit standing of the 
SMEs. This will also promote a better understanding by SMEs of their financial conditions, 
drawn from the analysis provided through the Bureau reports.  
Initiatives  have  been  taken  to  continuously  develop  new  financing  products  that  meet  the 
evolving  needs  of  SMEs  in  various  segments  and  stages  of  growth.  This  includes  the 
introduction of the new CGC guarantee scheme to assist start-up SMEs that have insufficient 
collateral and insufficient financial track record to obtain bank financing.  
Finally,  to  complement  the  financial  infrastructure,  initiatives  have  been  taken  to  develop 
comprehensive  financial  advisory  services.  Bank  Negara  Malaysia's  Laman  Informasi 
Nasihat  dan  Khidmat  or  BNMLINK,  and  BNMTELELINK,  which  is  a  dedicated  Contact 
Centre, provide financial advisory services to the SMEs. In addition, Bank Negara has also 
BIS Review 90/2008

established the Small Debt Resolution Scheme where viable SMEs that are constrained by 
non-performing loans are assisted through loan restructuring and the provision of additional 
funding.  
Today, SME financing has become robust with financial institutions being the main provider 
of  SME  financing.  In  2007,  banking  institutions  approved  RM55  billion  in  new  financing  to 
more than 109,000 SME accounts. For the first five months of 2008 alone, a total of RM22.7 
billion in new financing was approved to more than 55,800 SME accounts. As at end-May 
2008,  outstanding  SME  financing  by  banking  institutions  amounted  to  RM120.3  billion.  In 
2008,  banking  institutions  are  projected  to  approve  RM61  billion  of  financing  to  more  than 
115,000 SME accounts, increasing at an annual growth rate of 10%.  
Over  the  years,  SME  customers  have  gained  a  more  prominent  standing  in  the  books  of 
banking institutions in Malaysia. Consequently, it is in the banking institutions' best interest to 
meet the requirements of viable SME customers, which may face difficulties in the current 
challenging environment. Banking institutions need to engage and regularly interface with the 
various  associations  that  represent  SMEs  to  ascertain  and  formulate  solutions  to  address 
issues  confronting  the  SMEs  while  also  communicating  the  requirements  expected  of  the 
SMEs.  Banks  also  need  to  provide  greater  flexibility  in  structuring  the  financing  facility 
including customisation of the repayment periods within acceptable risk management levels. 
Banks may also expand the provision of advisory services to SMEs and proactively seek out 
SME customers that may be facing stress in this difficult business environment well before 
their conditions deteriorate. Adequate advice on financial management could pre-empt and 
avoid problems with respect to the financing facility.  
Bank  Negara  Malaysia  has  also  advocated  for  the  migration  to  electronic  payments  as  a 
measure  to  improve  efficiency  levels.  This  cannot  be  overemphasised  in  the  current 
environment. The adoption of electronic means of payments would result in greater business 
efficiency in addition to reducing the cost of doing business. It is important for the businesses 
including  the  SMEs  to  place  high  priority  on  the  adoption  of  more  expedient  and  efficient 
means  of  payments.  In  facilitating  this  transition,  Bank  Negara  Malaysia  is  reducing 
transaction fees for the RENTAS system (the real time gross settlement system operated by 
Bank  Negara  Malaysia)  for  payments  made  by  financial  institutions  on  behalf  of  their 
customers.  With  effect  from  15  July  2008,  the  RENTAS  transaction  fee  imposed  on  the 
member banks will be reduced by RM1.00, from RM2.50 to RM1.50. This reduction in fees 
will result in a corresponding reduction in bank charges imposed by member banks on their 
customers for RENTAS payments with effect from the same date. In addition, the banking 
industry will be reviewing the fee structure for fund transfers to apply a fixed fee instead of 
the existing Inland Exchange Commission of 0.03%.  
In this environment, the SMEs also need to initiate their own measures to complement those 
undertaken  by  the  Government  and  the  banks.  Achieving  cost  efficiency  and  productivity 
improvements  needs  to  be  a  priority  for  SMEs.  SMEs  should  look  at  every  facet  of  their 
business operations to identify ways to streamline processes, eliminate waste, consolidate 
activities  and  adopt  new  technology  and  energy-efficient  processes.  SMEs  that  operate  in 
common geographical locations and that have similar production inputs, should also consider 
pooling their purchase requirements to benefit from bulk discounts by suppliers, in addition to 
sharing common costs such as transportation. In this regard, the Chambers of Commerces 
and industry associations can have a key role. They can facilitate the bulk purchase of raw 
materials  for  their  members.  Experience-sharing  sessions  can  also  be  organized  for 
successful members to share their experiences in achieving cost efficiency and productivity 
improvements.  
As important as achieving cost efficiency is the need to raise the level of value creation and 
to find new areas of growth. This will require shifting resources to new areas of competitive 
advantage. In striving towards long-term competitiveness, SMEs should adopt best practices 
in their governance and risk management processes. An aptitude for hard work and prudent

practices, the agility to adapt to changing conditions, perseverance and entrepreneurial skills 
and the ability for reinvention â€“ these are the qualities that will enable SMEs to ride through 
the  near  term  challenges  and  allow  them  to  grow  and  enhance  their  contribution  to  our 
economy.  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
Today's seminar provides a platform for SMEs to widen their knowledge on the numerous 
financing arrangements offered by the banking institutions. Take advantage and benefit from 
this  opportunity.  On  this  note,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  Association  of  Banks  in 
Malaysia for organising this important seminar on "Enhancing SME Awareness on Access to 
Financing". I wish you a productive and successful seminar.
