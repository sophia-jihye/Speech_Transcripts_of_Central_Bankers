John Gieve: The financial cycle and the UK economy 
Speech by Sir John Gieve, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, at the London Stock 
Exchange, London, 18 July 2008. 
 Introduction 
These are troubled times for both the City and the economy more widely. After 15 years of 
unbroken  growth  and  low  inflation,  the  prospect  for  the  rest  of  this  year  is  uncomfortable: 
inflation will continue to rise sharply while growth tails off and unemployment picks up. And 
the  downturn  is  particularly  pronounced  in  the  banking  sector.  While  the  acute  concerns 
about  funding  that  emerged  last  summer  have  ebbed  a  little  since  March,  worries  about 
future  losses,  profitability,  and  even  the  viability  of  some  business  models,  have  been 
growing on both sides of the Atlantic, leading to sharp falls in most equity prices and, in the 
UK, to difficulties in bank rights issues.  
This morning I want to say a little about the challenges this sets the MPC in the short term 
but also to address some of the longer term lessons of the credit crunch.  
Global imbalances and the credit crunch 
One  of  the striking  aspects  of  this downturn  is  that  it  started  –  at  least  in  Europe –  in  the 
financial sector. The level of defaults on lending to households and companies is still very 
low. The credit squeeze here has not been, initially at least, a response to losses at home 
but driven by the dramatic loss of liquidity in financial markets (Chart 1) which was set off by 
the US sub-prime downturn.  
One  puzzle  has  been  why  that  problem  in  one  part  of  one  country’s  housing  market  has 
triggered such global turmoil. Of course the US is not just any country. But while the numbers 
may  look  large  in  absolute  terms,  even  if  sub-prime  losses  reach  $500  billion  as  the  IMF 
have suggested1, they will be quite modest relative to the size of the whole banking system. 
The answer is that sub-prime provided only the initial spark and the fire fed on much broader 
weaknesses in the financial sector, which in turn had been allowed to develop by imbalances 
in the global economy.  
The most striking feature of the world economy in the last decade has been the explosive 
growth of China and other emerging economies. For example, since China joined the WTO 
in 2001, its imports and exports have expanded on average by 25% each year, more than 
twice the growth in world trade over that period.  
But these countries have been reluctant to rely, in net terms at least, on foreign capital either 
because of their own previous currency crises or their observation of the painful adjustment 
experienced by others. Foreign direct investment has been permitted to allow the transfer of 
technology  and  expertise  but 
through 
accumulation  of  foreign  reserves.  Some  countries  have  preferred  to  maximise  their 
production of tradeables by undervaluing their real exchange rates through fixed or heavily-
managed nominal exchange rates to the US dollar. As the absolute sizes of their economies 
have  increased,  so  have  their  current  account  surpluses  and  the  scale  of  their  foreign 
flows  have  been  re-exported 
these  capital

reserve  accumulation  is  now  massive.  Global  foreign  exchange  reserves  have  increased 
from just under $2 trillion in early 2000 to over $7 trillion in May 2008 and are forecast to 
grow by $1 trillion in 2008 alone (Chart 2). 
The vast excess savings of these economies needed somewhere to go. The gainers were in 
the West where the asset and financial markets were most developed. The inflow brought 
greater liquidity to markets and helped to create the conditions for widespread underpricing 
of risk. The counterpart to the excess savings in the East became expansion of credit, the 
growth  of  consumption  and  a  boom  in  asset  prices  in  the  West.  Looked  at  in  a  global 
perspective,  the  dramatic  increases  in  wealth  and  living  standards  in  emerging  economies 
have been a great step forward. But the growth pattern has been unbalanced and we are 
now having to handle the inevitable correction.  
In  that  sense,  the  innovation  that  led  to  the  exponential  growth  of  new  structured  credit 
markets in recent years was not just a product of new technology and more aggressive risk 
taking in Western financial markets; it was also a flawed response to these wider imbalances 
in the global economy.  
Sources of procyclicality 
But weaknesses in modern credit markets, and the “originate to distribute” model of banking, 
have certainly been a good part of the problem. The development of new markets and credit 
instruments  has  tended  to  amplify  the  financial  cycle  –  they  have  been  pro-cyclical  in  the 
jargon  –  and  has  introduced  or  strengthened  the  misalignment  of  incentives  and  flawed 
measures of risk.  
Of course financial markets have always tended to develop a strong cycle. There is a natural 
feedback  between  asset  prices  and  credit  availability.  When  credit  supply  increases, 
households and companies who were previously credit constrained find it easier to borrow. 
Their increased ability to buy assets bids up prices. And these higher-priced assets can be 
used  as  collateral  to  secure  loans.  So  as  asset  prices  rise,  so  does  collateral,  thereby 
increasing the willingness of banks to supply credit.  
But in recent years this has been reinforced by some structural and regulatory changes. The 
growth of credit risk transfer through securitisation has tended to increase the proportion of 
banks’ balance sheets that come under mark-to-market accounting. Even gradual changes in 
the  values  of  the  underlying  loans  have  tended  to  appear  as  abrupt  changes  in  banks’ 
trading  and  treasury  books.  When  liquidity  was  abundant,  asset  values  were  high  and 
marked-to-market  profits  were  high.  Now  that  liquidity  is  scarce  and  asset  values  lower, 
mark-to-market losses and write-downs are high.  
The widespread use of credit ratings in valuing assets and managing counterparty credit risk 
has  also  had  an  impact.  Credit  rating  agencies  try  to  rate  through  the  cycle.  And  for 
corporate ratings they may well succeed. But for some structured finance products, such as 
re-securitisations  of  sub-prime  backed  securities  they  (like  many  others)  misjudged  the 
impact  of  a  downturn  in  the  cycle  and  the  non  linearity  of  returns.  As a  result,  there  have 
been  wholesale  downgrades  of  the  credit  ratings  of  structured  securities  over  the  past  12 
months. The problem for the financial system is that these ratings are often hard-wired into 
decision making. Certain classes of investors are forced to sell assets when they lose a AAA 
or investment grade rating. 
Remuneration  structures  have  also  amplified  risk  taking  in  the  upswing.  Two  features  of 
remuneration in the financial industry are that they are asymmetric (there is unlimited upside 
for  high  performance  but  a  floor  on  the  downside)  and  tend  to  be  based  on  short-term 
targets.  The  asymmetry  in  reward  creates  an  incentive  to  gamble  and  short-term 
performance targets encourage traders to follow rather than counter a deviation from long-
run fundamentals. Even where the incentives were paid in options linked to the medium-term 
performance of the employer, the apparent rewards have been highly cyclical.

In  addition,  regulation  can  also  encourage  procyclical  risk  taking.  Basel  I,  for  example, 
encouraged  the  growth  of  securitisation  and  the  “originate  to  distribute”  model  of  banking 
because holding the low risk elements of a loan portfolio in the banking book were relatively 
heavily capital-weighted. Basel II contains more carefully calibrated capital risk-weights and 
is  a  considerable  improvement  over  Basel  I.  But  the  risk  measures  are  drawn  from  the 
market  and  share  some  procyclical  features.  Weights  increase  as  credit  risk  rises  so  risk-
weighted assets will seem relatively low during tranquil economic times and relatively high 
during periods of stress. While there may be scope within Pillar II to address this, it is too 
early to know whether that can be used effectively. 
The combination of these market and regulatory effects have amplified risk taking during the 
boom and is now constraining risk appetite as financial conditions have deteriorated.  
Policy responses 
Since the crisis broke last summer, regulators, governments and central banks have come 
together in the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) to analyse what has gone wrong and agree 
an international response. Its recommendations have been approved by the IMF and the G8 
and  include  a  range  of  measures  to  fill  particular  gaps  or  put  right  particular  faults  in  the 
regulatory system by: 
• 
strengthening prudential oversight of capital, liquidity and risk management; 
implementing Basle II and requiring more capital against, for example, off-balance-
sheet vehicles, securitisations and tail risk; 
enhancing  transparency  and  valuation  particularly  for  complex  structured 
financial products and off-balance sheet vehicles; 
changing the role and uses of rating agencies, including by distinguishing ratings 
of corporates and structured products;  
strengthening the authorities’ responsiveness to risk; and 
increasing the robustness of arrangements for dealing with financial stress; 
ensuring  central  banks’  operational  frameworks  are  flexible  enough  to  deal  with 
extraordinary situations in money markets and mechanisms for dealing with weak or 
failing banks are put in place. 
   More generally we are discussing in the FSF how the authorities can go further in moderating 
the financial cycle.  
Of course monetary policy can play a role in this. One goal of monetary policy is to stabilise 
the  economy  in  the  face  of  shocks  and  central  banks  have  always  looked  at  credit  and 
money growth as important indicators of the state of the economy. The rapid growth of credit 
in 2006 for example was one factor leading the MPC to start raising interest rates. However 
central banks have been wary of putting a lot of weight on disciplining financial markets by 
changing  interest  rates.  Famously  Alan  Greenspan  asked  “But  how  do  we  know  when 
irrational  exuberance  has  unduly  escalated  asset  values,  which  then  become  subject  to 
unexpected and prolonged contractions..?”  
There  are  two  good  reasons  for  care.  First  policy  has  to  be  appropriate  for  the  whole 
economy; the interest rates which would be needed to have a significant effect, say, on the 
growth  of  house  prices  in  recent  years  might  have  been  far  too  high  for  other  industries. 
Secondly central bankers have been cautious to put much weight on their own assessments 
of  when  an  increase  in  asset  prices  is  becoming  unsustainable.  If  they  get  the  judgement 
wrong, they risk slowing growth needlessly and bring inflation persistently below target.  
Even if central bankers put more weight in future on their judgements of excesses in financial 
markets, it seems highly desirable also to make the regulatory system more counter-cyclical.

A  number  of  proposals  have  recently  been  put  forward,  which  would  have  the  effect  of 
directly increasing a bank's capital requirements during an economic upturn and allow room 
for capital requirements to fall in a downturn. For instance Professors Goodhart and Persaud 
have  put  forward  a  scheme  linking  a  bank's  capital  to  the  growth  in  its  assets.  Another 
possibility  is  to  learn  from  the  Spanish  system  of  requiring  banks  to  set  aside  general 
provisions against their loan book in good times which can be a cushion against losses in the 
downturn.  There  are  some  drawbacks  to  each  of  these  particular  proposals  but  we  are 
discussing the best approach both with the FSA and with our international colleagues in the 
FSF.  
Current challenges for the MPC 
Making sure we do set in place capital and liquidity regimes which dampen the next cyclical 
upswing in financial markets is important. More immediately, we also have to deal with the 
present conjuncture and I want to finish this talk with some reflections on that.  
If the sharp credit squeeze was the only challenge we faced, the Monetary Policy Committee 
would  be  expected  to  continue  reducing  rates  to  mitigate  the  risks  of  an  excessive  fall  in 
demand and in inflation in the medium term. But of course we do face another simultaneous 
shock, the sharp rise in commodity prices, which is driving up inflation across the world. And 
that  raises  the  question  whether  we  should  be  raising  rates  rather  than  reducing  them. 
Moreover recently each month seems to have brought more worrying news on both fronts.  
The cost shock 
In the May Inflation Report, the Committee forecast a pickup in inflation to well over 3 per 
cent, above target and driven in large part by the huge rises we have seen in energy and 
food  prices  (Chart  3).  Since  those  projections  were  put  together,  oil  prices  have  risen  a 
further 20% and food prices by a further 5%. And the Consumer Price Index has risen faster 
than we were expecting, reaching 3.8% in June. We are a little behind the US where inflation 
now  stands  at  5%  or  the  Euro  area  where  it  has  reached  4%  but  the  gap  is  expected  to 
continue to narrow. The peak monthly rate will depend on the exact timing of energy price 
rises but we are expecting inflation to be well over 4% for much of the rest of the year. 
Of  course,  not  all  prices  are  rising  so  quickly.  The  prices  of  clothing  and  footwear  fell  by 
almost  8%  over  the  past  year.  And  the  price  of  durable  goods  like  plasma  TVs  has  been 
falling even faster. But it is the rising cost of regularly purchased essential goods, like food 
and  petrol,  which  attract  most  attention  and  probably  drive  people’s  inflation  expectations, 
which have continued to drift up.  
This  increase  reflects  in  large  measure  a  rise  in  world  prices  for  commodities  which  we 
cannot avoid, but we must ensure that it is only a temporary spike and that inflation returns to 
target when this year’s increases fall out of the index in a year’s time. Above all that means 
ensuring that the higher rate of inflation does not become embedded in the expectations and 
behaviour of wage and price setters. The fact is that when their relative prices rise we cannot 
avoid a transfer to the producers of oil and other commodities, because they are difficult to 
substitute out of. That transfer is bound to hit real wages one way or another but the more 
that  is  resisted  and  nominal  wages  are  pushed  up,  the  greater  the  cost  is  likely  to  be  in 
unemployment and slower growth.  
We have no direct lever on public expectations. We need not just to assert our determination 
to bring inflation back to target but ensure that our words are credible. So, in setting interest 
rates we need not just to assess the balance between supply and demand pressures in the 
economy which will set the context for price and wage decisions in the medium term, but also 
ensure  that  our  decisions  are  understood  and  seen  to  respond  to  the  economic 
developments in inflation and output that people are experiencing.

It  is  clear  that  with  inflation  rising  well  above  target  we  need  a  period  of  slower  growth  to 
create a margin of spare capacity. The questions we discuss and reconsider each month are 
how big a margin is necessary and what level of interest rates is needed to bring it about.  
The Credit Crunch 
On  the  scale  of  the  necessary  output  gap,  for  example,  we  need  to  take  account  of  the 
supply effects of the doubling of oil prices and the impact of migration. On the other side we 
need to judge how sharp a slowdown is already in train.  
In  deciding  the  necessary  level  of  interest  rates  we  need  not  just  to  focus  on  the  level  of 
Bank Rate. We need also to take account of the impact of the turmoil in the banking sector 
which is now leading to a fierce squeeze on credit especially in the housing market but not 
just there. The increase in bank margins over safe rates have offset the cuts we have made 
to Bank Rate since last summer and the tightening of other conditions have introduced some 
quantity  restrictions  which  are  not  fully  captured  in  price.  Our  credit  conditions  survey 
suggests that this squeeze may intensify in the coming months.  
Timely sources of data suggest that the economy is already slowing fast. The CIPS survey 
balances  are  now  pointing  to  a  contraction  in  activity  in  manufacturing,  construction  and 
services  (Chart  4).  House  prices  and  transaction  numbers  are  falling  rapidly  with  direct 
effects on house builders and related services. And while there are winners as well as losers 
from  lower  house  prices,  there  are  signs  that  the  housing  market  is  affecting  consumer 
confidence. More broadly, there are signs that the tightening of credit conditions is beginning 
to  affect  both  consumption  and  investment.  Most  importantly,  the  sharp  increases  in 
commodity  prices  are  squeezing  real  take-home  pay  which  is  bound  to  impact  on 
consumption at some point. 
Conclusion 
I  began  this  speech  by  highlighting  how  the  recent  events  in  financial  markets  have  been 
facilitated  by  the  integration  of  emerging  economies  into  the  global  economy.  Of  course,  I 
could make an even closer link with rising commodity prices. The rapid expansion in activity 
in these economies has inevitably put pressure on the global price of energy and other raw 
materials,  whose  supply  is  relatively  fixed  at  least  in  the  short  run.  That  is  showing  up  in 
rising inflation world wide (Chart 5).  
So  is  it  right  to  conclude,  as  some  have,  that  the  path  of  inflation  is  determined  abroad? 
Certainly commodity prices have an effect in the short run. But it is domestic monetary policy 
–  the  decisions  that  the  Monetary  Policy  Committee  take  each  month,  together  with  the 
overarching framework that defines our target – that determines the path UK inflation in the 
medium-run.  The  MPC  will  continue  to  assess  the  balance  between  the  risks  of  higher 
inflation from the commodity cost shock and the downside risks to output (and to inflation in 
the medium term) from the credit crunch. But I can assure you that we will do whatever it 
takes to bring inflation back to target in the medium term.
