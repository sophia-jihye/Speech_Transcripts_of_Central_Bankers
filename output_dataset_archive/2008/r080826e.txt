Svante Öberg: The economic situation 
Speech by Mr Svante Öberg, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the KOMMEK 
fair, Malmö, 21 August 2008. 
 GDP  growth  will  slow  down  this  year  and  next  year.  Employment  will  stagnate  and 
unemployment will begin to rise. Inflation is high but will fall towards the target of 2 per cent 
over  the  coming  years.  This  is  the  picture  of  the  expected  development  of  the  Swedish 
economy reported in the most recent Monetary Policy Report published at the beginning of 
July.  
In my presentation today I shall describe my view of economic developments abroad and in 
Sweden, explain how we Executive Board members viewed monetary policy in connection 
with the most recent monetary policy decision at the beginning of July and describe what has 
happened in the economy over the summer. In the first three sections I will mainly describe 
the forecasts from the Monetary Policy Report published in early July, but I will also mention 
some data that have been published since then. In the fourth and final section of my speech I 
will take up the most important information on developments in the Swedish economy that 
has been received since early July. 
1.  
International developments 
No end to the financial crisis yet 
The problems in the international financial markets continued during the first half of this year. 
Although substantial losses have been taken up in the financial institutions’ balance sheets, 
and they have been allocated new capital to a large degree, we have not yet seen the end of 
the financial crisis. Different measures of risk premiums are still at a high level compared with 
the period prior to last summer.  
One  can  illustrate  the  problems  in  different  ways,  for  instance  by  means  of  the  so-called 
basis spreads, which demonstrate the difference between interest rates between the banks 
and the expected policy rate set by the central bank. This measure reflects pricing of the risk 
faced by the banks when lending to other banks. The basis spreads increased significantly in 
August last year. Sweden has also been affected by the global financial crisis, but to a lesser 
extent than many other countries. The basis spreads have, for instance, increased more in 
the United States and the euro area than in Sweden. But it is at the same time important to 
remember that the crisis has increased the Swedish banks’ vulnerability to shocks.  
Although the basis spreads have declined somewhat in the euro area and in Sweden since 
last  spring,  they  have  not  returned  to  the  earlier  levels  yet  and  one  cannot  exclude  the 
possibility of new problems arising that will push risk premiums even higher. 
Weaker growth in the USA 
Economic developments in the United States continued to deteriorate during the first half of 
the year. This was largely connected to problems in the financial markets. In the most recent 
Monetary Policy Report published at the beginning of July we were expecting GDP growth in 
the United States to slow down to around 1.5 per cent a year in 2008 and 2009.  
I  agreed  on  the  whole  with  the  picture  of  international  developments  presented  in  the 
Monetary  Policy  Report,  but  my  assessment  was  that  developments  in  the  United  States 
could be even weaker than we were assuming. There is a risk that we will have to lower the 
forecasts even more in coming reports, particularly the forecasts for 2009. GDP growth in the 
BIS Review 100/2008

second quarter of 2008 was actually slightly stronger than we had expected. GDP increased 
by 0.5 per cent compared with the first quarter.  
Growth  in  the  United  States  is  now  largely  being  upheld  by  exports  alone,  which  are 
increasing at a good rate as a result of world growth and the dollar depreciation (compared 
with the level 2-3 years ago). Domestic demand will on the whole not show any increase in 
2008 and 2009. I do not believe that the recovery in domestic demand will get started before 
the financial system has stabilised and before the fall in US house prices has come to a halt. 
House prices have continued to fall during the summer.  
Growth in Europe will also slow down 
Europe  fared  better  than  the  United  States  at  the  beginning  of  the  year.  This  is  partly 
because  the  financial  crisis  originated  in  the  United  States  and  the  financial  market 
turbulence has not been as severe as there. Another explanation is that the financial balance 
is  better  in  Europe;  public  sector  finances  have  improved  in  recent  years  and  the  current 
account is close to zero. We assumed in the Monetary Policy report that GDP growth in the 
euro area would slow down to 1.7 per cent in 2008 and 1.2 per cent in 2009, to reach almost 
2 per cent in 2010.  
At  the  beginning  of  July  we  had  seen  little  sign  of  the  slower  growth  in  the  statistics  on 
production and in the National Accounts. On the contrary, there had been several positive 
surprises. However, there were tangible signs of a future slowdown in other types of data, 
such  as  corporate  and  household  confidence  indicators.  The  quick  figures  for  the  second 
quarter now indicate that GDP in the euro area declined by 0.2 per cent compared with the 
first quarter, which was weaker than we had expected.  
Global growth still strong 
GDP growth in the world as a whole has been very strong over the last four years, around 5 
per cent a year. Not since the early 1970s, prior to the first oil crisis in 1973, have we seen 
such strong growth in the world for such a long period of time. One important explanation for 
the  rapid  growth  is  that  previously  planned  and  closed  economies  have  been  transformed 
into market economies and opened up to the outside world. The forecasts in the Monetary 
Policy Report entail world GDP growth slowing down to around 4 per cent a year in 2008-
2009 and later rising again to around 4.5 per cent in 2010.  
Growth in the world was thus expected to remain relatively strong, despite the fact that we 
see ahead of us a couple of years of slower growth in the United States and the euro area. 
This is because of the strong growth in emerging and developing economies. For instance, 
the OECD calculates in its most recent forecast on an average annual GDP growth rate in 
the so-called BRIC countries of 4-5 per cent for Brazil, 7 per cent for Russia, 8 per cent for 
India and 10 per cent for China during the years 2008 and 2009. The emerging economies 
together account for around half of the world GDP and for three quarters of the growth in the 
world in 2008 and 2009.  
Rising and falling commodity prices in the world market 
The  strong  world  growth  has  been  the  most  important  reason  behind  the  sharp  rise  in 
commodity  prices.  Commodity  prices  have  risen  for  six  years,  and  these  increases  have 
accelerated over the last two years. Rapid growth has led to an increase in the demand for 
energy.  It  is  almost  impossible  to  make  good  forecasts  for  the  oil  price.  The  Riksbank’s 
forecasts are therefore based on the prices of forward contracts for oil, that is, the price of 
delivering oil in the future. This means that at the monetary policy meeting in July we were 
assuming a price for crude oil of USD 130-140 per barrel during the forecast period. Since 
April the oil price has fluctuated substantially. First it rose to USD 147 a barrel and since then 
it has fallen. At the beginning of this week the oil price was USD 113 a barrel.

 BIS Review 100/2008
Food prices have also risen substantially in the world market, particularly over the past year. 
Rising incomes, urbanisation and changes in diet lead to an increase in the demand for food. 
As  oil  becomes  more  expensive  it  becomes  profitable  to  use  maize  and  other  grains  to 
produce biodiesel and biofuels. Furthermore, the production costs for foods are rising. Other 
factors  such  as  supply  shocks  and  speculation  in  future  price  changes  also  affect 
developments. Our assumption in June was that food prices would not continue to increase, 
but would stabilise at a high level. Since the beginning of July food prices have fallen. 
High international inflation and rising inflation expectations 
The upswing in commodity prices in recent years has in turn led to an increase in inflation 
around the world. In the United States it has risen to 5.6 per cent and in the euro area it rose 
to 4.0 per cent in July 2008. It has risen much more in several emerging economies. For the 
world as a whole, the IMF calculated that inflation will rise from around 4 per cent in 2007 to 
almost 5 per cent in 2008. Inflation expectations have also risen in several countries. 
The most probable development is that inflation will slow down next year. When adjusted for 
energy and food prices, inflation has been relatively stable. Normally, inflation slows down 
when growth slows down, even if this is with some time lag, and our forecast in the Monetary 
Policy Report is for growth in the world to be lower this year and next year. At the beginning 
of the summer we were also able to note that, unlike the situation in the spring, monetary 
policy  expectations  had  swung  towards  higher  interest  rates  in  several  countries.  A  tight 
monetary policy contributes to dampening inflation. 
But  there  is  a  risk  that  the  inflation  process  will  be  more  prolonged.  It  was  estimated  that 
growth  in  the  world  will  continue  to  be  relatively  strong,  despite  a  slowdown  in  the  United 
States and the euro area. In a slightly longer perspective, when the slowdown in the United 
States  and  the  euro  area  becomes  an  upswing  once  again,  there  is  also  a  risk  that  the 
problem  of  rising  commodity  prices  will  return.  Several  emerging  countries  will  experience 
rapid growth for some time to come.  
2.  
Developments in Sweden 
Weaker growth and labour market in Sweden 
Growth will also slow down in Sweden. In the Monetary Policy Report we assumed that GDP 
growth in Sweden will be 2.1 per cent this year and 1.2 per cent next year. 
Several  factors  indicate  a  slowdown  in  growth.  For  instance,  Swedish  exports  will  be 
negatively  affected  by  the  weaker  international  growth,  particularly  in  the  United  States. 
Moreover  Swedish  households’  consumption  will  slow  down  for  several  reasons.  Real 
disposable  incomes  will  show  weaker  development  and  real  wealth  will  be  dampened. 
Households’ expectations are very pessimistic. 
At  the  same  time,  there  are  factors  that  may  to  some  extent  hold  back  a  slowdown.  The 
financial  balance  in  Sweden  is  good;  the  current  account  shows  very  large  surpluses  and 
public  sector  finances  are  robust.  The  latter  make  it  reasonable  to  assume  further  fiscal 
policy stimulation over the coming years. In addition, the Swedish financial sector has fared 
relatively  well  in  the  international  financial  turbulence,  which  reduces  the  risk  of  a  serious 
credit crunch.  
But growth will nevertheless slow down. This means that the labour market will deteriorate 
towards  the  end  of  the  year.  We  assumed  in  the  Monetary  Policy  Report  that  the  rapid 
increase  in  employment  would  come  to  a  halt  this  year  and  that  employment  would  fall 
slightly  over  the  coming  two  years.  We  also  assumed  that  the  decline  in  unemployment 
would cease and that unemployment will increase slightly in the coming two years.

Inflation is high but expected to fall towards the target of 2 per cent 
Inflation was 4.4 per cent in July. This is the highest figure measured since the mid-1990s. 
Inflation is now far above the inflation target of 2 per cent.  
The upswing in inflation over the past year can largely be explained by rises in energy and 
food  prices,  but  higher  wage  increases  and  weaker  productivity  growth  also  contribute  to 
higher  inflationary  pressures.  Higher  interest  rates  also  contribute  in  the  short  term  to  the 
high inflation through rising housing costs. The forecast in the Monetary Policy Report was 
for inflation to remain high over the coming year and then to fall towards 2 per cent at the end 
of the forecast period. 
Continued high inflation expectations 
For a long time inflation expectations have been firmly anchored around the inflation target of 
2 per cent. There have thus been no special reasons for us at the Riksbank to highlight them 
in  our  reports  and  speeches.  However,  since  the  beginning  of  2006  inflation  expectations 
have gradually risen.  
According to the Prospera survey in June, inflation expectations for one year ahead were 3.2 
per cent and expectations for five years ahead were 2.6 per cent. The expectations for one 
year ahead are largely in line with our own forecast, but the fact that expectations for five 
years ahead are way above the inflation target is more worrying.  
The rising inflation in Sweden and abroad would not be a problem if it was just a question of 
a  temporary  rise  and  if  inflation  expectations  remained  at  a  low  and  stable  level.  But  if 
secondary  effects  arise,  or  if  inflation  expectations  rise,  monetary  policy  may  need  to  be 
tightened. It is important for monetary policy that what started as increases in oil and food 
prices in the world market does not spread to other areas and that inflation expectations in 
the slightly longer term do not become entrenched at a higher level, but fall back towards the 
inflation target once again.  
We know that inflation expectations can be largely explained by the actual rise in inflation. 
However,  we  do  not  know  very  much  about  how  monetary  policy  affects  inflation 
expectations over and above the effect via inflation, and how inflation expectations in their 
turn affect long-term inflation.  
There is an interesting approach in the academic research which involves the general public 
looking at outcomes and gradually learning how the economy functions and how the central 
bank  reacts.  If  households  are  to  believe  that  the  central  bank  focuses  on  low  and  stable 
inflation they must be able to observe such behaviour. But such a process may take time, 
which  we  in  Sweden  could  conclude  in  the  mid-1990s  when  our  own  inflation  target  was 
established. This is an area we need to study more. 
Wage costs rising more than before 
In the Monetary Policy Report we assumed that hourly wages would increase by an average 
of  around  4  per  cent  a  year  during  the  three-year  agreement  period.  This  is  around  1 
percentage  point  a  year  more  than  during  the  previous  three-year  period.  In  addition,  we 
calculated on unit labour costs increasing by an average of almost 3 per cent a year in 2007-
2010, to be compared with largely 0 per cent a year in 2002-2006.  
The  high  inflation  rate  could  affect  wages  through  demand  for  compensation  for  the  price 
increases. However, this does not seem very likely at present. The slowdown in growth and 
the expected weakening of the labour market are factors that weigh against such a scenario. 
In addition, we now have three-year agreements in most areas of the labour market which 
regulate the agreed wage increases. Nor are there, as there were in the 1970s and 1980s 
and are in some other countries, price guarantees in the agreements that provide automatic 
4 
 BIS Review 100/2008
compensation  for  price  rises.  These  were  abolished  in  connection  with  the  so-called 
Rehnberg agreement at the beginning of the 1990s. 
It is, on the other hand, important that inflation and inflation expectations fall to around 2 per 
cent  ahead  of  the  next  round  of  collective  bargaining  in  2010.  With  the  current  inflation 
forecasts, average inflation over the three  preceding years will then have been over 3 per 
cent, which may be a problem. However, this would nevertheless mean that real wages prior 
to tax increase by around 1 per cent a year during the current three-year agreement period. 
After tax the increase is larger, perhaps 2-3 per cent a year. 
Monetary policy 
3.  
To summarise, at the monetary policy meeting in July we had a situation with rising inflation 
and inflation expectations together with growth coming to a standstill in Sweden and abroad. 
Such a situation brings central banks face to face with difficult decisions. Either they tighten 
monetary  policy  despite  a  slowdown  in  economic  activity,  or  they  accept  a  higher  inflation 
rate. This was the choice we faced in July. 
Given  the  course  of  events  outlined  in  the  Monetary  Policy  Report,  the  Executive  Board 
decided to raise the repo rate from 4.25 per cent to 4.50 per cent, and we assessed that a 
well-balanced monetary policy entailed raising the interest rate a couple more times over the 
year. 
Events since the previous meeting in April provided justification, in my opinion, for raising the 
interest rate and the interest rate path. The primary reasons were that inflation had increased 
and by more than we had previously expected, that inflation expectations had increased and 
were above the inflation target and that expectations of interest rates abroad had changed 
from falling to rising policy rates. We had revised our inflation forecast upwards for both this 
year and next year, despite the higher interest rates. 
However, this did not mean that I disregarded growth and employment. The Riksbank’s task 
is  to  ensure  that  inflation  is  low  and  stable.  If  we  moreover  can  support  growth  and 
employment without neglecting the price stability target, we will do so. In practice this often 
means that we allow the time for bringing inflation up or down to the target to vary depending 
on the prospects for economic activity.  
According  to  our  monetary  policy  strategy,  our  policy  is  normally  aimed  at  attaining  the 
inflation  target  within  two  years.  The  calculation  we  made  in  July  indicated  that  it  would 
probably have required a slightly higher interest rate path than that described in the Report to 
bring inflation down to 2 per cent in two years. This would have brought down growth even 
lower next year. Given that inflation was deviating so far from target and taking into account 
the uncertainty in the financial markets, it would have been better, in my opinion, to aim at 
bringing down inflation to around 2 per cent in three years. 
I  do  not  believe  that  the  decision  in  July  can  be  regarded  as  any  severe  tightening  of 
monetary policy. The interest rate is still relatively low. The nominal interest rate prior to the 
decision at the beginning of July was at a long-term average of 4.25 per cent. But the real 
interest  rate  was  still  lower  than  an  historical  average.  In  July  the  real  interest  rate  was 
around 1.5 per cent, but it will rise during the forecast period to just over 2.5 per cent at most. 
The interest rate path we described in July entailed a change from a relatively neutral to a 
slightly contractionary monetary policy. 
We were unanimous on the one decision to raise the interest rate by 0.25 per cent, but not 
on the other decision regarding the interest rate path. The majority of the Executive Board 
members considered it reasonable to have an interest rate path that involved a substantial 
probability  of  a  further  two  increases  during  the  year,  while  the  minority  considered  it 
reasonable  to  have  an  interest  rate  path  that  involved  some  probability  of  one  further 
increase.  The  minority’s  assessment  was  that  the  slowdown  of  the  economy  that  is  now 
BIS Review 100/2008 
 5
taking place would dampen inflationary pressures to a greater extent than assumed in the 
main scenario. There would therefore be less need to continue increasing the interest rate. 
Developments during the summer 
4.  
I have earlier discussed what happened during the summer in the world around us. The trend 
of falling growth and rising inflation has broadly continued. One important change is that the 
oil price and other commodity prices have begun to fall, which may further slow down price 
increases. The dollar has risen in value against the euro and the krona, which also means 
that the krona has weakened against a weighted average of other currencies. The financial 
market turmoil has also continued. 
I intend to conclude by summarising the important new information on developments in the 
Swedish  economy  since  the  monetary  policy  meeting  at  the  beginning  of  July.  Statistics 
during the summer confirm the picture that growth in the Swedish economy is slowing down 
and that inflation remains high. 
Seasonally-adjusted,  the  GDP  figures  for  the  second  quarter  remained  largely  unchanged 
compared with the first quarter. This was a weaker outcome than we expected in the July 
Monetary Policy Report. There is a clear trend towards falling GDP growth from around 1 per 
cent a quarter two years ago to close to zero over the past six months. At the same time we 
know that GDP growth figures for the first and second quarters are usually revised upwards 
in later National Accounts publications, so we will not know the final outcome until a couple of 
years from now. In addition, one should bear in mind that monetary policy looks ahead. We 
cannot  affect  what  has  happened  during  the  second  quarter  of  this  year.  It  is  only  to  the 
extent that the new information affects our forecasts for the coming years that it is important 
to monetary policy.  
The  National  Accounts  also  indicate  that  productivity  continued  to  decline  in  the  first  two 
quarters. We had assumed that productivity would increase. Hourly wages increased by  4 
per cent from January to May this year, compared with the same period last year, according 
to  preliminary  wage  statistics  from  Statistics  Sweden  and  the  National  Mediation  Office. 
Normally  the  figures  are  revised  upwards  in  statistics  published  somewhat  later,  but  the 
statistics nevertheless indicate that there have not yet been any unexpected rises in the rate 
of wage increase. If anything, it looks to be slightly lower than anticipated. However, so far 
this year wage costs per produced unit nevertheless appear to have increased by more than 
we had expected as a result of the weaker productivity.  
Employment continued to increase during the second quarter of this year, but unemployment 
remained largely unchanged compared with one year ago. The outcomes were close to the 
forecasts. The number of hours worked per week continued to increase during the first half of 
the year, which contributed to a decline in productivity. 
The  Economic  Tendency  Survey  in  July  was  also  weak.  It  fell  and  now  indicates  that  the 
Swedish economy is much weaker than normal. It is mainly households that are contributing 
to the low level. This is the most pessimistic that households have been about the Swedish 
economy for 15 years. The confidence indicator for the Swedish business sector fell, but it is 
nevertheless at a level corresponding to the average since 1996.  
The  Economic  Tendency  Survey  also  shows  that  sales  prices  in  the  wholesale  and  retail 
trade continued to rise to a large extent and that continued increases are predicted for the 
third quarter. Households’ and companies’ inflation expectations continued to rise. They even 
rose  more  than  is  indicated  by  statistical  correlations  between  inflation  and  inflation 
expectations.  However,  inflation  expectations  as  measured  in  the  bond  market,  what  is 
known as breakeven inflation, have declined. 
Inflation rose from 4.0 per cent in May to 4.3 per cent in June and 4.4 per cent in July. This is 
around a tenth more than we estimated in our Monetary Policy Report. Compared with the 
6 
 BIS Review 100/2008
forecast in the Report, it is primarily electricity prices that have been higher than calculated. 
Food prices increased by 8 per cent, which is more than in almost all of the countries in the 
euro  area  and  could  indicate  that  what  started  out  as  price  increases  in  the  world  market 
have  begun  to  spread  to  other  goods.  On  the  other  hand,  oil  and  other  commodity  prices 
have fallen, which may dampen inflation in the future. However, the  krona has weakened, 
which makes imports more expensive. 
To sum up: the picture presented in July largely remains unchanged – with lower growth and 
high inflation. But GDP growth has so far this year been weaker than anticipated. Inflation is 
at its highest level since the mid-1990s. However, oil and other commodity prices have fallen. 
At the same time, productivity has been lower and resulted in increased wage costs. 
At the Riksbank we are now working hard on producing new forecasts for the coming years. 
At the beginning of September my colleagues and I will take a new monetary policy decision. 
We will then once more take a stance on economic developments and on how the interest 
rate should be set to attain our inflation rate of 2 per cent.

than expected.
(cid:132) Inflation is at its highest since the mid-1990s.

fallen.
(cid:132) At the same time, productivity has been lower, 
which has led to increased wage costs.
