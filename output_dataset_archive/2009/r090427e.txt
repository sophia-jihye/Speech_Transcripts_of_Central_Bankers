Philipp Hildebrand: Principles for sound compensation practices 
Summary of a speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of 
the Swiss National Bank, at the Economic Outlook 2009 (Unternehmer NW-Schweiz), Basel, 
23 April 2009. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 Most  financial  institutions  viewed  compensation  systems  as  being  largely  unrelated  to  risk 
management and risk governance prior to the crisis. Short-term profits were rewarded with 
generous  bonuses  with  little  regard  to  the  longer-term  risks  taken  on  behalf  of  the  firm  to 
generate those profits. With hindsight, it should therefore be no surprise that these bonuses 
fueled the excessive risk-taking that has ultimately undermined the global financial system. It 
is  important  for  the  future  stability  of  our  financial  system  that  compensation  systems  be 
viewed as an integral part of the risk management system in financial firms, and designed 
and  governed  with  this  in  mind.  The  Financial  Stability  Board  (previously  the  Financial 
Stability  Forum)  has  drafted  a  set  of  sound  compensation  principles  for  large  financial 
institutions with exactly this goal in mind. The Principles were endorsed by the G20 leaders 
at  the  London  summit  earlier  this  month  and  aim  to  be  widely  implemented  by  the  2009 
remuneration round.
