José De Gregorio: The Chilean economy in the current conjuncture 
Speech by Mr José De Gregorio, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, before the Executive 
Committee  of  Chile’s  Confederación  de  la  Producción  y  del  Comercio,  Santiago,  30 June 
2009.  
 First and foremost, thank you for inviting me to speak about the Chilean economy’s current 
situation and future prospects. The world crisis that is underway poses big challenges, and 
the  effects  it  is  having  on  our  country  as  it  unfolds  stress  how  important  it  is  to  keep  in 
contact with the entrepreneurial community to share our vision and become aware of your 
impressions.  
When  we  presented  our  Monetary  Policy  Report  (the  Report)  of  last  May,  we  gave  an 
account of the difficulties facing the world economy, which will see output drop for the first 
time in six decades. Moreover, this crisis has been characterized by great synchrony among 
countries, regardless of the strengths or weaknesses of each one (figure 1). As we have said 
over  and  over  during  and  after  the  most  stressful  times  in  external  financial  markets,  our 
country  could  not  and  would  not  be  immune  to  the  effects  of  the  crisis.  Actually,  the 
macroeconomic  outlook  changed  radically  while  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  reacted 
accordingly to the challenge, by adding a stimulus of unprecedented magnitude and speed. 
In the case of our Central Bank, between January and June we reduced the monetary policy 
interest rate (MPR) by 750 basis points to 0.75% annually, the lowest ever.

In  recent  weeks,  news  from  abroad  has  ceased  to  be  mostly  negative.  Various  agents’ 
projections for world growth have stabilized, and some have even risen marginally (table 1). 
Still, this is not enough to be seen as a significant external boost for our economy, because 
world growth remains at low rates.

Commodity prices have posted substantial increases in the past few weeks. Both copper and 
oil have seen their prices rise more than 50% since the end of 2008. The copper price hike 
reflects increased demand, especially from China. In the case of the oil price, the increase 
began showing in domestic prices, partly offset by the recent appreciation of the peso. 
Little  by  little,  dislocations  in  international  financial  markets  are  being  fixed.  Interbank 
markets,  which  a  few  months  back  had  to  deal  with  serious  liquidity  problems,  have 
continued to normalize thanks to the liquidity provision measures adopted by the authorities 
and the gradual recovery of expectations. On the other hand, institutions have been able to 
raise  capital  according  to  needs;  the  US  Treasury  even  authorized  some  of  the  bailed-out 
banks  to  repurchase  the  preemptive  stocks  they  issued  when  receiving  the  governmental 
support under TARP.  
One key factor behind this set of elements pointing at stabilization is, without a doubt, the 
scale  of  the  monetary  and  fiscal  stimulus  packages  that  have  been  implemented  in  large 
parts  of  the  world,  in  both  developed  and  emerging  economies.  This  is  a  significant 
difference between this crisis and the Great Depression. Although it has been claimed that 
the financial debacle we have experienced recently is similar in magnitude to the one that 
originated  the  Great  Depression,  the  lessons  learned  from  it  have  allowed  policies  to  act 
much faster, with more effective and pragmatic responses.  
In  those  days,  fiscal  authorities  tried  to  keep  their  budgets  balanced,  even  when  the 
economic depression had settled in, in 1937, thereby deepening the contraction of aggregate 
demand. In the case of monetary policy, the premature reduction of the monetary stimulus in 
1936  contributed  decisively  to  the  recession  of  1937-38.  The  current  monetary  policy  has 
played  its  role  in  providing  liquidity  and  generating  an  expansionary  stimulus.  The  much 
more  flexible  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  of  today  have  also  avoided  the  intrusion  of 
protectionist  distorting  measures  that  so  prolonged  the  crisis  of  the  1930s,  amplifying  its 
costs  and  deeply  hurting  the  later  economic  development  in  several  regions  of  the  world, 
including our country.  
Still, it is likely that returning to domestic demand levels like the ones we had before the crisis 
takes a while, especially in the United States. Active fiscal policy actions have taken up the 
room left by the shrinkage of private spending. However, it cannot be sustained for long. The 
natural, sustainable solution will come via net exports from the US and, to a lesser extent, 
from Europe. How it will happen is an open question, because it is also yet to be seen which 
economies  will,  as  counterparts,  have  to  reduce  their  own  net  exports  to  create  the 
2 
 BIS Review 93/2009
necessary  space  for  such  an  adjustment.  Furthermore,  this  may  call  for  major  parity 
adjustments in the main economic areas. 
Beyond this last point, currently floating foreign exchange regimes have played a stabilizing 
role, providing every degree of freedom needed by monetary policy and by liquidity provision 
measures to tackle the cycle and the financial stability objective. This element was nowhere 
to  be  seen  in  the  1930s,  when  the  main  central  banks struggled  hard, but  ineffectively,  to 
defend  the  gold  standard,  severely  magnifying  tensions  in  the  banking  systems.  Many 
emerging economies have successfully applied the lessons learned in past financial crises, 
capitalizing  them  as  increased  financial  resilience  and  a  reduced  impact  on  growth  than 
developed countries. 
One  feature  of  world  financial  markets’  behavior  of  the  past  few  months  has  been  the 
increase in long-term interest rates on public instruments. These movements can be linked to 
an environment of reduced risks and expected increases in fiscal debt certificates, and to the 
fact that, for the first time in several months, there is incipient debate about the convenience 
of  a  not-so-expansionary  monetary  policy,  given  the  medium-term  inflationary  risks.  In  the 
local financial markets, the interest rates on long-term Central Bank notes have also risen—
albeit  with  swings—above  the  levels  that  prevailed  at  the  time  of  our  May  Report.  The 
steepening of the yield curve coincides with what has occurred in international markets, and 
may  be  signaling  an  increase  in  the  markets’  appetite  for  risk.  It  may  also  be  that  they 
respond to more idiosyncratic factors, especially because of the big momentum showed by 
the local bonds market this year to date.   
The pass-through of MPR cuts to lending rates in recent months has been evident. While the 
latest data suggest that it may have moderated, transmission should continue, particularly as 
macroeconomic  uncertainties  phase  out.  The  annual  growth  rate  of  credit  volume  has 
slowed, in a context where lending standards are still tight and there is less demand for credit 
due to a more cautious attitude among economic agents. 
In addition, short-term figures known since the publication of our last Report point at milder 
short-term inflationary prospects. The latest output indicators have been more negative than 
we foresaw in May. Although for the moment this does not alter our forecast of a recovery of 
activity and demand in the second half of this year, it does present a scenario where output 
gaps are wider than estimated and, therefore, inflationary pressures are reduced. The labor 
market  also  continues  to  reflect  deteriorated  macroeconomic  conditions,  with  steadily 
increasing unemployment although with a marginally moderated drop in employment.  
May’s  inflation  was  negative  beyond  expectations,  especially  its  underlying  components. 
Year-on-year CPI inflation, after many months, returned to the tolerance range of the inflation 
target (figure 2), but is expected to continue to fall and even cross into negative territory in 
the  latter  part  of  the  year.  Inflation  expectations  derived  from  various  surveys  also  show 
some declines in the last few months.  
Recent public discussions have centered on parity movements. The real exchange rate is, 
without any doubt, a key variable in resource allocation and in the balance between saving 
and investment. Unlike conjunctures of past decades, in particular those of the mid-1980s, 
the  Chilean  economy  has  dealt  with  the  complex  global  financial  situation  from  a  much 
sounder standpoint. The sudden global collapse of late last year found us with no big current-
account or fiscal deficit, nor with a high external debt requiring strong fiscal adjustments with 
substantial  real  depreciation  that  would  place  the  economy  in  a  sustainable  medium-term 
path.  On  the  contrary,  the  significant  contraction  of  domestic  demand,  in  particular  for 
imported  durable  goods  and  inventories,  spontaneously  and  quickly  undid  the  incipient 
external deficit of the second half of 2008 and interest rates in Chile dropped. The Chilean 
economy has continued to show a very solvent net external position.

As  we  have  pointed  out  on  earlier  occasions,  persistent  movements  of  the  exchange  rate 
may have inflationary consequences that must be taken into account when deciding on the 
monetary  impulse.  Anyway,  our  floating  regime  admits  intervening  in  exceptional  cases, 
whenever an overreaction of the exchange rate is detected that is giving misleading signals 
to the financial markets. In addition, although there is no obvious misalignment of the current 
real  exchange  rate  from  its  long-term  fundamentals,  the  present  inflationary  scenario  may 
accommodate a nominal depreciation that does not compromise our price stability objective. 
In  fact,  imported  inflationary  pressures  influence  medium-term  inflation,  so  if  the  recent 
appreciation of the peso persists, inflationary prospects will certainly moderate, which, as I 
just stated, has implications on the conduct of monetary policy.  
From the public finance standpoint, it is hardly obvious that the aforesaid situation could have 
been  avoided  with  a  different  mix  of  credit  sources  for  the  necessary  fiscal  impulse.  This, 
because the level and the structure of interest rates are also important when trying to affect 
gaps and inflation in the medium term. 
Summing up, the changes we have seen in the macroeconomic scenario since last May lead 
us to think that, if anything, inflationary pressures are less than were forecast, so the risk of 
inflation remaining below the 3% target longer than estimated has increased. In this context, 
it may be necessary to increase the monetary stimulus. Although given the current low level 
of the MPR there is limited room for maneuvering, an additional cut cannot be ruled out. We 
must  also  keep  in  mind  that  expectations  about  the  course  of  monetary  policy  affect  the 
market interest rate structure and the exchange rate. The Board was clear—both in the May 
Report  and  in  June’s  monetary  policy  meeting—in  that  it  estimates  that,  in  the  baseline 
scenario, it would be necessary to hold on to the monetary stimulus for a longer period than 
the  one  implicit  in  financial  asset  prices.  Recent  information  continues  to  validate  this 
diagnosis (figure 3).

The macroeconomic scenario we are facing continues to be complex. Although it seems to 
have  ceased  to  deteriorate  in  the  margin,  we  must  not  lose  sight  of  the  fact  that  a  global 
crisis of this magnitude has few precedents for comparison in modern economic history. As I 
said before and we have repeated endlessly, Chile could not and would not be immune to 
external developments. The crisis hit us hard. The consequences are visible in the drop in 
domestic  output  and  demand,  in  a  deteriorated  labor  market  and  in  reduced  inflationary 
pressures. More importantly, however, the economic conjuncture we are facing has called for 
decisive action by economic policymakers. Thus we have responded at the Central Bank and 
thus we will continue to respond, despite that our monetary policy tool, the MPR, is currently 
close to its minimum possible level.  
Thank you.
