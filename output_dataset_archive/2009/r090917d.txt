Andrew G Haldane: Credit is trust  
Speech by Mr Andrew G Haldane, Executive Director, Financial Stability, Bank of England, at 
the Association of Corporate Treasurers, Leeds, 14 September 2009. 
I would like to thank Paul Fullerton, Simon Hall and Salina Ladha for help in the preparation of this speech.  
  It is good to be back in Yorkshire. I say back because I grew up around 10 miles north of 
here. When I left over 20 years ago, Leeds looked and felt very different to today. Nowhere is 
the  contrast  greater  than  in  the  financial  sector.  In  1995,  almost  74,000  people  were 
employed  in  financial  and  related  business  services,  accounting  for  around  20%  of 
employment  in  Leeds.  By  2009  this  had  risen  to  over  116,000,  or  around  30%  of 
employment.  Today,  Leeds  has  a  legitimate  claim  to  be  the  UK’s  second  largest  financial 
centre. 
A short history of banking in Yorkshire 
The foundations for this success were laid much earlier. The history of banking in Yorkshire 
dates back over 250 years.1 Pease and Co of Hull, established in 1754, are thought to be 
Yorkshire’s  oldest  private  bank.  In  the  same  decade,  banks  were  founded  in  Leeds  and 
Bradford. By the end of the 18th century, Yorkshire had a well-established network of over 40 
banks in around 16 regional towns and cities.  
In the first two decades of the 19th century, private banking in Yorkshire continued to thrive, 
spreading to around 30 towns and cities. The financial crisis of 1825 brought an end to this 
rapid  growth.  The  crisis  itself  was interesting  for  its  parallels  with  today.  It  was  sourced  in 
sub-prime lending in (in this case South) America. As fears of loan losses rose, runs began 
on banks throughout England, with more than a dozen institutions failing in Yorkshire alone.  
The crisis brought reform of the banking industry in the form of the Joint Stock Banking Act of 
1826. This removed the Bank of England’s monopoly on joint stock banking. This had long 
been a bone of contention among country banks, not least in Yorkshire. The Bank of England 
itself opened its first branch in Yorkshire – here in Leeds, in fact – the following year in 1827. 
This  was  acknowledgement  of  Leeds’  emerging  importance  as  a  financial  centre.  Yet  the 
reception it received was, to say the least, somewhat mixed.  
Local newspapers and businessmen attacked the Bank’s attempt to spread its “pestilential 
branches” into the regions.2 Bank of England notes were shunned by local shopkeepers. The 
landlady of the Esk Inn near Whitby did so with the words: 
“I’ll ha’ nought to do with them things, I know nought about them; now if it had 
been a Simpson I would ha’ changed it with pleasure”3

It  is  easy  to  imagine,  though  probably  impossible  to  print,  what  she  might  have  made  of 
Quantitative Easing. 
In the period since, banking and finance in Yorkshire have grown steadily and successfully. 
Among the success stories would be the Yorkshire Penny Bank. This was founded in 1859 in 
Halifax  as  a  means  of  saving  for  the  working  classes.  In  1874,  its  first  School  Transfer 
Department was opened to encourage saving by school children. “Take care of the Pence 
and the Pounds will take care of themselves” intoned the bank’s posters.  
Such was the success of the school scheme that, by the end of the nineteenth century, the 
majority of schoolchildren in Yorkshire had a savings account. The scheme aimed to educate 
children from an early age on the benefits of thrift and financial planning. And having been 
nurtured early, the relationship between bank and customer often lasted a lifetime. In 1959, 
the  Yorkshire  Penny  Bank  became  Yorkshire  Bank  which  today  remains  one  of  the  UK’s 
most successful medium-sized banks.  
The mutual or building society sector’s roots in Yorkshire are just as deep.4 Although the first 
societies  appeared  in  the  Midlands  in  around  1775,  within  a  decade  Yorkshire  had 
established  its  first  society,  the  Hill  House  Bank  Building  Club  in  1785.  By  the  end  of  the 
century,  numbers  had  swelled  to  around  50,  mostly  in  the  Midlands,  Lancashire  and 
Yorkshire.  
The  early  mutuals  pooled  savings  to  buy  property  for  members  and  terminated  once  all 
members’  housing  needs  were  satisfied  –  so-called  “terminating  societies”.  In  1844, 
“permanent societies” were permitted, which allowed for a revolving set of both savers and 
borrowers. But the mutuality principle remained – “to enable a working man to secure himself 
in the course of a few years a dwelling-house as his own freehold property, as a home for 
himself and family.”5 
Numbers of mutuals grew rapidly during the 19th century, reaching around 850 by 1850 and 
over  1500  by  1875,  with  almost  100  in  Yorkshire  alone.  Here  in  Leeds,  the  Leeds  and 
Holbeck Permanent Building Society was founded in 1875 and, having been renamed Leeds 
Building  Society  in  2005,  it  remains  in  the  top  10  building  societies  by  size  nationally. 
Consolidation  and,  latterly,  demutualization  have  reduced  numbers  over  the  past  few 
decades. Today, there are only a handful of independent, indigenous mutuals in the region. 
But they remain some of the strongest in the country.  
The success of Yorkshire’s financial sector over this lengthy period is no fluke. A reading of 
history  reveals  the  same  successful  recipe  being  repeated.  An  awareness  of,  and 
responsiveness to, the needs of the customer, whether saver or borrower. A focus on long-
term relationship-building, often starting from the earliest age. A recognition of the benefits of 
mutualising  both  risks  and  returns.  In  short,  the  importance  of  banks  being  built,  first  and 
foremost, on trust. 
The crisis of trust 
From  the  past,  then,  to  the  present.  A  year  ago  almost  to  the  day,  the  investment  bank 
Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in the United States. Activity across the globe, financial 
and  non-financial,  froze.  Recently,  there  are  indications  of  some  thawing.  But  a  year  on, 
many economies around the world remain mired in recession. What explains the severity of 
this crisis and how much longer can it be expected to last?

The words “credit crunch” contain the seeds of an explanation. In Latin, credit means trust. 
So credit crunch is, in essence, a breakdown in trust. Between different parties at different 
times, that loss of trust has been the root cause of the devastating impact felt globally since 
the credit crunch began. It also explains why the road to recovery in credit, and thus in the 
real economy, may be long and winding. In essence, events of the past two years can be re-
told as a story of the progressive breakdown in trust.  
The proximate cause of the crisis was a breakdown of trust between banks and households, 
specifically  sub-prime  mortgage-holders  in  the  United  States.  The  upshot  was  a  loss  of 
credit, and in many cases the homes, of these borrowers from 2006 onwards. Repossession 
rates on US mortgages have more than tripled in the past two years (Chart 1). UK arrears 
and  default  rates,  although  lower,  are  rising.  Some  borrowers  are  now  rationed  out  of  the 
mortgage market. In July 2007, there were around 9500 sub-prime mortgage products being 
advertised in the UK. Today, there are virtually none (Chart 2). 
As losses on these mortgages and other toxic assets accumulated, trust among banks was 
impaired. This saw a seizing-up of inter-bank money markets from the second half of 2007 
onwards. Before the crisis, banks required about 10 basis points of compensation for making 
a  three-month  loan  to  one  another  (Chart  3).  By  September  2007,  that  compensation 
premium had risen tenfold to around 100 basis points. By September 2008, it had risen more 
than  thirty-fold  from  pre-crisis  levels.  It  has  since  fallen  back  to  around  35  basis  points. 
These  persistent  funding  pressures  have  constrained  banks’  ability  to  lend  to  the  real 
economy. 
Damaged  by  losses  on  assets  and  constrained  by  funding  costs,  questions  began  to  be 
raised during 2008 about banks’ future profitability and, in some cases, viability. The equity 
prices of banks tumbled, falling 86% on average for the major UK banks between February 
2007 and March this year (Chart 4). In money terms, that is a loss of market capitalisation of 
around  £300bn,  equivalent  to  20%  of  annual  UK  GDP.  Underlying  these  price  falls  was  a 
generalised loss of trust between banks and investors in banks, such as sovereign wealth 
funds and mutual funds.  
What  explained  this  wholesale  loss  of  trust?  In  the  run-up  to  the  crisis,  banks’  business 
models  were  increasingly  predicated  on  making  loans  for  onward  sale.  Loans  became 
tradable  securities  and  long-term  relationships  gave  way  to  short-term  transactions.  The 
perils of this practice were well understood by Michael Marks, founder of Marks and Spencer 
and of course one of the region’s greatest-ever entrepreneurs: “You either make things or 
you sell them. Don’t try both”.  
Banks  tried  both,  making  loans  with  an  eye  to  subsequently  selling  them.  This  had 
unintended, but in fact entirely predictable, consequences. Without skin in the game, banks’ 
due diligence became slipshod. The quality of tradable loans fell as their quantity rose.  
Investors  in  these  securities  were  not  as  canny  as  the  landlady  of  the  Esk  Inn:  they 
purchased them in size even though “they knew nought about them”. By the time the penny 
had dropped for these investors, the pounds had not taken care of themselves. Global losses 
on  these  securitised  assets  are  now  believed  to  lie  anywhere  up  to  £3  trillion.6  As  losses 
accumulated, trust in these securities was undermined and with it trust in the banks issuing 
them.  
As  credit  was  cut,  trust  in  the  viability  of  some  non-financial  companies  was  questioned. 
Corporate distress began to rise internationally during the course of 2008. And as corporate 
distress rose, in particular after the failure of Lehman Brothers, distrust between companies 
mounted.  The  stream  of  trade  credit  extended  between  firms  dried  to  a  trickle  at  the  end 
2008  and  in  the  first  part  of  2009.  At  that  time,  a  survey  by  the  Bank’s  regional  agents

reported that around a quarter of contacts had had to turn down potentially profitable orders 
as a result of tighter trade credit. 
This  progressive  hardening  of  the  credit  arteries  also  had  dramatic  effects  between 
countries. Cross-border flows of credit have reversed dramatically in the past year. “Home 
bias” by investors – a lack of trust in foreign investments – has returned with a vengeance. 
Cross-border lending by international banks grew by 20% per year between 2003 and 2007. 
In 2008, it fell 5% (Chart 5). This has had adverse effects on UK companies, around a third 
of whose borrowing comes from foreign lenders. 
Through these successive waves, the world financial system found itself with almost every 
link  in  the  credit  chain  –  in  the  chain  of  trust  –  having  been  weakened  or  broken.  That  is 
evident in surveys of the public’s trust in industry: banking and finance are firmly rooted to 
the foot of the league table of trust, in the UK and internationally (Chart 6). That loss of trust 
is mirrored in aggregate bank lending in the UK, in particular to companies, where annual 
growth has fallen from a peak of 23% in March 2008 to around zero now (Chart 7). And this 
has in turn been reflected in the largest and most synchronous global economic slowdown 
since the Great Depression.  
Confidence and credit 
So how is trust, and thereby credit, to be restored? To date, the answer has been to rely on 
the one sector whose credit has not been seriously questioned – governments and central 
banks. There has been large-scale provision of government and central bank credit over the 
past two years in an attempt to ease pressures and shore up breaks in the private sector 
credit chain.  
These interventions have been unprecedented in size during peacetime. The total potentially 
on the table is in excess of $14 trillion.7 That is roughly $2000 for every man, woman and 
child  on  the  planet.  Half  of  the  world’s  20  largest  banks  have  needed  direct  government 
support. Central bank balance sheets in the major financial centres, including in the UK, have 
more than doubled in size. And deposit insurance schemes have been extended in at least 
40 countries around the world.  
Extending public sector credit on this scale relies on the deep pockets and prudence of our 
grandchildren. It can be no more than a stop-gap – a temporary bridge – until private sector 
trust can be restored. So far, the bridge has served its purpose. There are signs over recent 
months  from  surveys  that  confidence  is  returning  to  banks,  non-financial  companies  and 
consumers.  And  there  have  been  some  signs  of  a  turnaround  in  the  housing,  equity  and 
some debt markets.  
It  has  been  said  that  every  recession  in  history  has  been  associated  with  a  collapse  in 
confidence.8  This  time’s  was  plainly  no  exception.  So  with  confidence  turning  can  we 
anticipate an imminent return of credit to the economy?  
Rising confidence among firms and consumers is a necessary condition for recovery. But it is 
questionable whether it is sufficient. That is because confidence and trust are subtly different 
concepts.9 Confidence derives from observable, authoritative proof. At the time of the failure 
of  Lehman  Brothers,  people  struggled  to  make  sense  of  the  state  of  the  economy  and 
financial system. Without a compass, they lost their financial bearings. Lacking authoritative

proof, confidence collapsed. As the banking system has since stabilised, people’s bearings 
have returned and with them confidence. 
Trust  is  an  altogether  different  animal.  It  is  based  on  beliefs,  not  observable  proofs.  It  is 
grounded  in  perceptions  rather  than  evidence.  It  is  as  much  a  psychological  state  as  a 
financial  one.10  A  clean  balance  sheet  might  instil  confidence,  but  it  need  not  repair  trust. 
Because  it  is  a  moral  judgement,  repairing  trust  can  be  a  slow  and  painstaking  business. 
Moral compasses take rather longer to self-correct than magnetic ones. This has implications 
for the path of recovery in the period ahead. 
Historically,  credit  has  tended  to  lag  the  recovery  in  output  in  the  majority  of  recessions, 
especially financial recessions. During the previous three major recessions in the UK – in the 
1970s,  1980s  and  1990s  –  credit  to  business  recovered  slowly  and  in  some  cases  only 
several years after the recovery in activity (Charts 8, 9 and 10). This is consistent with trust 
between  financial  institutions  and  their  customers  being slower  to  recover  than  confidence 
more generally.  
Moreover, unlike the situation today, earlier recessions in the UK were not primarily the result 
of financial factors. International evidence suggests that financial recessions have tended on 
average to be both costlier and lengthier.11 Normal recessions have been associated with a 
recovery in output to its previous peak after around 3 ½ quarters. Recovery to peak output 
following financial recessions has on average taken around 5 ½ quarters (Chart 11).  
Like its predecessors, lack of confidence may have “caused” this time’s recession. But it is 
lack of trust – and hence credit – that may shape the recovery. Based on past evidence, as 
the Governor has noted recently, we might anticipate a protracted period of repair. 
Repairing trust – the low road to reform 
So  what  might  be  needed,  beyond  time,  to  repair  trust  in  the  financial  system?  A  raft  of 
reforms to the financial system, nationally and internationally, is currently being assembled. 
These  measures  will  aim  to  strengthen  banks’  financial  resources,  risk  management 
practices and governance. They are about bringing regulatory rules into the 21st century.  
This is the high road to reform – for example, higher buffers of capital and liquidity and higher 
standards of risk management. If successful, these reforms will help cleanse bank balance 
sheets.  It  is  an  open  question,  however,  whether  these  efforts  will  be  sufficient  to  restore 
public trust in the financial system.  
One reason why regulation might not be the whole answer is that trust in financial regulation 
is itself one of the casualties of crisis. Regulation is seen by some as part of the problem, not 
the  solution.  More  generally,  in  repairing  public  trust,  it  would  be  preferable  if  banks  were 
seen  to  be  initiating  root  and  branch  reform  themselves,  rather  than  having  it  thrust  upon 
them by regulators.  
This would be the low road to reform. Low because it would not require any new or complex 
regulatory apparatus. Low because it would not need international negotiation or agreement 
on the contractual fineprint. Instead, what it would require is a self-generated sea-change in 
the structure and strategy of banking.  
So what changes in structure and strategy might be desirable? Without suggesting definitive 
answers,  let  me  discuss  three  areas  where  further  debate  might  be  useful:  banks’  size  in

relation to the services they provide; banks’ strategy in relation to their resilience; and banks’ 
governance in relation to the incentives this creates.  
Structure – size versus service provision  
• 
Economies  of  scale  typically  arise  in  the  production  of  goods  and  services  which  are 
homogenous and replicable. Henry Ford applied this principle to car manufacture through his 
Ford Motor Company, established almost a century ago. It was a success. That model has 
since served many industries well.  
But  manufacturing  loans  is  not  the  same  as  manufacturing  cars.  Loans  are  neither 
homogenous nor replicable. Making loans relies on bespoke, customer-specific information. 
This information is not obtained by computer algorithm or credit rating agency but through a 
banking  relationship,  ideally  a  long-term  one.  Despite  the  advent  of  social  networking, 
economies of scale are not something we typically associate with long-term relationships. 
So  the  economics  of  banking  do  not  suggest  that  bigger  need  be  better.  Indeed,  if  large-
scale  processing  of  loans  risks  economising  on  the  collection  of  information,  there  might 
even  be  diseconomies  of  scale  in  banking.  The  present  crisis  provides  a  case  study.  The 
desire  to  make  loans  a  tradable  commodity  led  to  a  loss  of  information,  as  transactions 
replaced  relationships  and  quantity  trumped  quality.  Within  the  space  of  a  decade,  banks 
went from monogamy to speed-dating. 
Evidence  from  a  range  of  countries  paints  a  revealing  picture.  There  is  not  a  scrap  of 
evidence of economies of scale or scope in banking – of bigger or broader being better – 
beyond  a  low  size  threshold.12  At  least  during  this  crisis,  big  banks  have  if  anything  been 
found  to  be  less  stable  than  their  smaller  counterparts,  requiring  on  average  larger-scale 
support.13 It could be argued that big business needs big banks to supply their needs. But 
this  is  not  an  argument  that  big  businesses  themselves  endorse,  at  least  according  to  a 
recent survey by the Association of Corporate Treasurers.14 
Take Grameen Bank – not a household name in the UK, I realise. This grew out of a micro-
finance project in Bangladesh which began in 1976.15 Grameen operates as a set of local 
credit cooperatives, often comprising as few as five members. The bank’s relationship with 
its borrowers is bound not by legal contract but by trust. Like the Yorkshire Penny Bank a 
century earlier, it aims to encourage saving by the poor and supports the education of the 
children of borrowers and savers.  
In  some  respects,  Grameen  Bank  is  about  as  basic  and  small-scale  a  set  of  banking 
arrangements as it is possible to conceive. But its success is only too clear. From the most 
modest  of  beginnings,  Grameen  Bank  now  operates  in  over  40  countries  worldwide,  with 
over 2000 branches and over 7.5 million borrowers. Grameen is a local bank gone global.  
Henry Ford grew an empire on scale economies, centralisation and replication. For the Ford 
Motor  Company,  bigger  was  better.  At  around  the  same  time,  Alfred  P  Sloan  of  General 
Motors  was  following  a  different  business  model.  Size  still  mattered.  But  production  was

decentralised and specialised. The focus was on customer needs supported by some of the 
first-ever market research on their tastes. In the end, it was Sloan and General Motors whose 
strategy was emulated around the world.  
In meeting the future needs of the real economy, perhaps there is a case for more “Sloans” 
and fewer “Fords” in banking. Perhaps there is a case for a strategic focus on the “local” as 
much as the “global”, for more micro-finance and less macro-finance. Perhaps it is time for 
relationship-banking to make a comeback. 
Strategy – diversity versus diversification 
• 
Customers require a basket of banking services. The provision of some of these services is 
important for the wider economy; they are a quasi-public good. For example, the provision of 
monetary services – basic banking – has a strong public good element. That is why depositor 
protection,  in  the  form  of  deposit  insurance,  is  stipulated  by  the  state  in  many  countries. 
Lending to households and companies can also be thought to contain a public good element. 
Other functions performed by banks may provide more limited social benefits, though their 
private benefit may be significant – for example, proprietary trading in complex instruments. 
If  scale  economies  in  banking  are  weak,  banking  services  could  probably  be  equally  well 
provided  by  either  a  financial  supermarket  or  a  set  of  specialist  banks.  These  different 
structures might not, however, be equivalent from a risk perspective. The supermarket model 
potentially does offer some risk benefits – the benefits of diversification. Profitable business 
lines can compensate for temporarily non-profitable ones. What is lost on the swings may be 
regained on the roundabouts.  
This is a story about which we have heard much over the past few months, especially among 
the biggest global banks. In the first half of this year, big losses on the banking book swings 
have been more than offset by big gains on the trading book roundabouts. Diversification, we 
were told, was paying dividends – and, indeed, bonuses.  
But  memories  can  be  deceptively  short.  Rewind  the  clock  one  year.  Then,  it  was  trading 
book  losses  that  were eroding  confidence in  the  banks.  This  in  turn  prompted  fears  about 
some banks’ solvency, aggravating the very recession which is now generating banking book 
losses. Trading book gains may well be acting as a hedge today. But they are hedging a risk 
they helped create.  
All of this implies that business line diversification can be a double-edged sword. During the 
upswing, banks enjoyed windfall gains from bets at the race-track. This boosted their buffers. 
But  when  those  bets  turned  sour,  these  same  activities  put  at  risk  banks’  day  job  –  the 
provision  of  loan  and  deposit  services  to  the  real  economy.  9500  sub-prime  mortgage 
products at the height of the boom might well have been too many. But zero is surely too 
few. 
There  is  a  second  important  downside  to  diversification.  While  it  might  be  sensible  for  an 
individual firm to diversify its business lines to reduce its risk, if this same strategy is followed 
by all banks the end-result may be greater fragility across the whole system. Why? Because 
in  their  desire  to  look  different  than  in  the  past,  banks’  business  strategies  may  end  up 
looking identical in the present. The financial system could then become more prone to herd-
like upswings and lemming-like downswings.  
There  is  more  than  a  hint  of  this  behaviour  during  the  run-up  to  crisis.  Banking  strategies 
became  a  whirligig.  Building  societies  transformed  themselves  into  commercial  banks. 
Commercial banks tried their hand at investment banking. Investment banks developed in-
house  hedge  funds  through  large  proprietary  trading  desks.  Hedge  funds  competed  with 
traditional investment funds. And to complete the circle, these investment funds imported the 
risk all of the others were shedding. In their desire to diversify, individual banks generated a 
lack of diversity, and thus resilience, for the financial system as a whole.

So recent crisis experience highlights some of the costs of bundling banking services. Given 
that,  there  is  an  intellectually  defensible  case  for  some  unbundling  of  these  services.  This 
would  reduce  the  risks  of  spill-over  between  privately  and  socially  beneficial  banking 
activities.  And  it  would  help  prevent  banks  making  individually  rational  but  collectively 
calamitous strategic choices.  
There  are  plenty  of  examples  from  the  non-financial  world,  from  genetics  to  geology,  of 
diversity improving the robustness of systems. The financial system may be no different. The 
resulting financial landscape would, however, look rather different. There would be greater 
specialisation and diversity. The shopping experience for a banking customer would be more 
farmers’ market than supermarket.  
Governance – stakeholders versus shareholders 
• 
In  deciding  appropriate  corporate  governance  arrangements,  economists  have  tended  to 
focus  on  the  relationship  between  shareholders  (as  principal)  and  managers  (as  agent). 
Principal-agent  problems  arise  when  these  two  parties’  incentives  are  misaligned.  Profit-
related  pay  is  one  means  of  achieving  alignment,  with  managers  remunerated  in  line  with 
shareholder returns. In addressing one incentive problem, however, this approach may risk 
worsening two others – between shareholders and depositors on the one hand and between 
shareholders and the public sector on the other.  
Limited liability means that returns to shareholders are capped below at zero, but not above. 
That  provides  a  natural  incentive  for  owners  to  gamble,  pursuing  high  risk/high  return 
strategies from which they import the return upside but export the risk downside to depositors 
or  the  public  sector.  During  this  crisis,  the  pursuit  of  those  strategies  has  resulted  in  the 
public  sector  picking  up  the  cheque  for  the  downside  in  an  effort  to  reduce  risks  to 
depositors.  
A  mutual  model  of  corporate  governance  gives  rise  to  a  rather  different  set  of  incentives. 
Instead  of  external  shareholders,  savers  and  borrowers  become  the  owners,  with  profits 
remitted directly to them in the form of higher deposit rates and/or lower borrowing rates. For 
that reason, measured profit margins appear consistently lower for building societies than for 
banks.  
Unlike  in  most  industries,  however,  low  margins  for  a  mutual  are  very  unlikely  to  result  in 
shareholder revolt or a missive to management to gear-up or get-out. They are a reflection of 
corporate governance working for stakeholders, here defined broadly to include depositors 
and borrowers. In this way, mutuality reduces the scope for misaligned incentives between 
shareholders and depositors which might otherwise arise in a joint stock bank.  
This  is  not  to  suggest  that  mutuality  is  a  panacea.  For  example,  it  does  not  address  the 
potential incentive problem between stakeholders and the public sector. Indeed, it could even 
potentially worsen this problem as shareholders and depositors are one and the same under 
mutuality and so must rank equally in the event of a payout from the public purse. Moreover, 
profit margins in the building society sector are currently under some pressure as a result of 
low Bank rate and increased competition for prime residential loans. Some building societies 
have also hit bad loan problems.  
Although painful in the short-term, these margin pressures ought in time to abate. So in the 
heartland  of  mutuality,  I  am  happy  to  say  that  reports  of  the  death  of  the  building  society 
sector are greatly exaggerated. Indeed, mutuality may do a better job of aligning stakeholder 
incentives than some alternative forms of corporate governance. It is a depressing but telling 
fact  that,  of  the  demutualised  former  UK  building  societies,  none  is  today  in  independent 
ownership.  
Thrift, mutuality and relationship-building have long underpinned banking in Yorkshire. These 
principles went missing in the run-up to the present crisis. The costs of that vanishing act are 
now all too apparent. In rebuilding the financial system, to create one which is both stable

and  better  able  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  real  economy,  these  principles  need  to  be 
rediscovered. They offer a tried and tested – indeed, trusted – roadmap for the period ahead.
