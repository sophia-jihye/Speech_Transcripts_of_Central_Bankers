Svante Öberg: Monetary policy, financial stability and the Riksbank’s 
balance sheet 
Speech by Mr Svante Öberg, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the Lund 
University, School of Economics, Stockholm, 1 December 2009. 
 Introduction 
The  Riksbank  has  for  just  over  a  year  now  taken  forceful  action  to  limit  the  negative 
consequences of the financial crisis. Using the Riksbank’s balance sheet as a starting point, I 
shall explain today what we have done. 
The  Riksbank’s  assignments  are  to  maintain  price  stability  and  to  promote  a  safe  and 
efficient payment system. These two assignments result in two main tasks for the Riksbank – 
monetary  policy  and  financial  stability  –  two  tasks  that  are  interlinked.  A  stable  financial 
system  is  necessary  to  conduct  effective  monetary  policy  and  price  stability  is  part  of  an 
efficiently-functioning payment system.  
During the financial crisis and the ensuing economic downturn the link between the two tasks 
has  been  strengthened.  The  Riksbank  has  implemented  extraordinary  measures  in  both 
areas  to  be  able  to  carry  out  its  tasks.  The  two  tasks  are  also  reflected  in  the  Riksbank’s 
balance sheet. 
I shall describe how the Riksbank has implemented monetary policy and the measures taken 
to stabilise the financial sector. It is primarily through changing the terms for various items on 
the balance sheet that the Riksbank has carried out its two tasks during the financial crisis. I 
shall therefore first provide a general outline of the Riksbank’s balance sheet structure. After 
this  I shall discuss  in  greater  depth  the  individual  items  on  the  balance  sheet,  to  see  how 
they have been affected over the past year. I shall conclude by looking ahead and discussing 
the question of when and how the extraordinary measures can be phased out.  
The Riksbank’s balance sheet 
Let us begin by looking at how the Riksbank’s balance sheet looks in rough outline under 
normal circumstances and at how it has changed during the crisis. The Riksbank’s balance 
sheet,  like  those  of  other  companies  and  organisations,  reflects  the  activities  we  conduct. 
The liabilities side shows how our activities are financed and the assets side show what the 
financing is used for (Figure 1).

Own capital
 Under normal circumstances the Riksbank primarily finances itself by issuing banknotes and 
coins and through its own capital. Banknotes and coins in circulation normally comprise the 
largest individual item on the liabilities side. Own capital is the next largest. In addition, the 
BIS Review 160/2009 
 1
liabilities  side  in  principle  consists  of  deposits  from  banks  and  the  item  “Miscellaneous”. 
These items are usually small and less important than banknotes and coins and own capital.  
The Riksbank’s assets normally consist mainly of gold and the foreign currency reserve. The 
gold reserve is a remnant of the days when banknotes and coins could be redeemed for gold 
at  the  Riksbank.  This  link  no  longer  exists  and  gold  is  now  regarded  purely  as  a  financial 
asset. The foreign currency reserve should primarily be used to allow the Riksbank to carry 
out its tasks with regard to monetary policy and financial stability. It consists of securities in 
foreign currency that are easy to sell and have a low risk. 
During  the  financial  crisis  the  Riksbank  has  increased  its  lending  to  the  banks  to  a  great 
extent.  As  a  result,  the  size  of  the  Riksbank’s  balance  sheet  has  increased  dramatically. 
Lending to the banks prior to the crisis was negligible, but during the crisis it has grown into 
the most prominent item on the assets side. The increased lending in turn results wholly in 
increased  deposits  in  the  Riksbank  by  the  bank  system  as  a  whole,  to  which  I  will  return 
later. This has meant that deposits from the banks have become the dominant item on the 
liabilities side. The Riksbank’s balance sheet increased in autumn 2008 within the space of 
three months from around SEK 200 billion to around SEK 700 billion (Figure 2).

Central  banks  in  other  countries  have  also  expanded  their  balance  sheets.  Owing  to  the 
nature of the crisis and the structure of the financial systems in different countries, the central 
banks have implemented different measures and to a different extent. However, common to 
them all is the fact that their balance sheet totals increased dramatically immediately after the 
US investment bank, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy in September 2008 (Figure 3).

How  has  the  work  on  our  two  main  tasks  affected  the  Riksbank’s  balance  sheet?  Let  me 
begin by discussing monetary policy and then move on to financial stability. 
Monetary policy 
The target of monetary policy is to maintain inflation at 2 per cent. The Riksbank normally 
steers  the  short-term  interest  rate  to  attain  this  target.  The  short-term  interest  rate  in  turn 
affects other interest rates, and thereby activity and prices in the economy. The Executive 
Board of the Riksbank decides on the repo rate at its monetary policy meetings. This shows 
the level at which the Riksbank wants the short-term interest rate to lie. The repo rate has a 
direct impact on other interest rates in the economy. I shall now describe how this works in 
practice and how it is reflected in the balance sheet. 
To counteract the deep recession the Riksbank has rapidly cut the repo rate to 0.25 per cent 
and announced that it will remain at this low level until next autumn (Figure 4).  
In normal circumstances the Riksbank can steer the short market rates without any tangible 
effect on its balance sheet. This is because the banks usually turn to one another directly to 
smooth deficits and surpluses in liquidity instead of turning to the Riksbank. They then pay 
an interest rate that is the same as the repo rate. The repo rate thus has a direct impact on 
the  interbank  rate  and  through  this  on  short-term  interest  rates  paid  by  companies  and 
households.

However, this mechanism has not functioned during the financial crisis. Banks that have had 
surplus  liquidity  have  wished  to  keep  it  available  for  their  own  use  instead  of  lending  it  to 
banks  with  a  deficit.  The  global  financial  crisis  has  also  led  to  the  Swedish  markets 
experiencing  problems  with  funding  in  the  financial  markets.  During  autumn  2008  the 
Riksbank  therefore  began  to  offer  loans  at  longer  maturities  to  the  bank  to  facilitate  their 
funding. As a result of this, the banks have had large liquidity surpluses and have to a great 
extent invested the surplus in the Riksbank. There are several possibilities for doing so. 
Firstly, the Riksbank issues Riksbank Certificates every week with a one week maturity and 
at an interest rate that is the same as the repo rate decided on, that is, at present 0.25 per 
cent. This assumes that the bank system – as is now the case – has a surplus and needs to 
invest money. If the bank system instead has a deficit, as was the case just over a year ago, 
then  the  Riksbank  will  implement  what  are  known  as  repos  every  week  with  a  week’s 
maturity. This means that the Riksbank buys securities from the banks with a simultaneous 
agreement that a repurchase will be made one week later and where the interest rate is the 
repo rate that has been decided. 
Secondly, the Riksbank carries out what are known as fine-tuning transactions every day to 
smooth the daily fluctuations in the bank system’s regular payments. The banks can invest 
money in the Riksbank overnight at an interest rate of 10 basis points below the repo rate, 
that is, at present 0.15 per cent. This also assumes that the bank system as a whole has a 
surplus towards the Riksbank at the end of the day. If they instead have a deficit, the banks 
can borrow money from the Riksbank overnight at a rate that is 10 basis points above the 
repo rate. The fine-tuning is normally very small, but during the crisis it has grown to entail 
very large amounts. 
Thirdly, there are so-called standing facilities. The banks have the right to borrow from the 
Riksbank overnight at a lending rate that is 50 basis points higher than the repo rate, and the 
right to invest surplus in the Riksbank at a deposit rate that is 50 basis points lower than the 
repo rate. But these possibilities are very little used, as there are other alternatives that are 
more advantageous for the banks.

 BIS Review 160/2009
Something that has attracted relatively great attention internationally is the fact that the low 
repo rate and the application of an interest rate corridor of plus/minus 50 basis points for the 
Riksbank's standing facility means that the Riksbank in principle applies a negative interest 
rate for deposits in the Riksbank. In practice, this is of little significance, as only a very small 
part  of  the  banks’  liquidity  surplus  is  invested  in  the  standing  deposit  facility.  Instead,  the 
banks invest most of their liquidity surplus at a positive interest rate in the daily fine-tuning 
transactions or the weekly Riksbank Certificates.  
Initially,  the  banks  invested  the  majority  of  their  large  surpluses  in  autumn  2008  in  the 
Riksbank  as  “fine-tuning”.  As  a  result  of  the  crisis  the  banks  had  a  substantial  need  of 
immediate access to liquidity. More recently they have invested most of their surplus in the 
weekly  Riksbank  Certificates,  which  is  a  sign  that  market  conditions  have  improved 
(Figure 5).

 The  fact  that  the  increased  lending  results  in  an  equal  increase  in  deposits  is  due  to  all 
transactions in Swedish kronor being made through the banks’ accounts in the RIX payment 
system, which the Riksbank administers. The loans are distributed in the Riksbank’s auctions 
by means of the banks presenting bids for how much money and at what interest rate they 
want to borrow at each separate auction. Immediately after the auctions are over the money 
is  distributed  between  the  banks  according  to  the  bids  that  have  come  in.  The  Riksbank 
credits an amount corresponding to the allocation in the respective bank’s account in the RIX 
system.  Then  when  the  banks'  transactions  and  payments  are  made  during  the  day,  the 
allocation of money between the banks changes, but the money never leaves the system.  
As we have already noted, the Riksbank has lent money to the banks on a wide scale since 
last  autumn  as  a  result  of  the  financial  crisis.  However,  monetary  policy  motives  have 
gradually also gained significance in the lending. As the repo rate is close to zero and can in 
practice hardly be cut further, a need has arisen to supplement monetary policy with loans at 
longer  maturities  and  at  a  fixed  interest  rate  to  also  bring  down  slightly  longer  rates.  The 
Riksbank  has  therefore  on  three  different  occasions  (in  July,  September  and  October) 
BIS Review 160/2009 
 5
offered  loans  of  up  to  SEK  100  billion  with  a  maturity  of  almost  one  year  and  at  a  fixed 
interest  rate,  to  contribute  to  bringing  down  the  interest  rates  households  and  companies 
have  to  pay.  On  the  first  two  occasions  the  loan  amount  was  fully  subscribed,  but  on  the 
most recent occasion the amount borrowed was SEK 95 billion. 
By setting interest rates on Riksbank Certificates and fine-tuning – and as we will come to 
shortly – setting interest rates on the Riksbank's loans to the banks, the Riksbank has been 
able to steer the short-term rate throughout the crisis.  
To summarise, monetary policy has been aimed at keeping inflation close to the target and at 
the same time dampening the fall in economic activity during the financial crisis. The repo 
rate has been quickly cut to an extremely low level. The steering of the short-term rates has 
functioned well throughout the crisis. The normal aim of  only steering the shortest interest 
rate has been supplemented with lending to the banks at longer maturities to be able to also 
influence interest rates further out on the curve. This means that monetary policy approaches 
questions regarding financial stability, which I will now discuss. 
Financial stability 
Financial stability is the Riksbank’s other main task. Put simply, it is a question of ensuring 
that the financial system is stable and that the payment system functions. The banks play a 
central role in financial stability as the majority of payments go through the bank system. 
The Swedish banks fund half of their borrowing through deposits from the general public and 
half of it through loans from one another and on the financial markets. If problems arise that 
prevent the banks from obtaining funding by borrowing from one another or on the financial 
markets, they can borrow from the Riksbank. The Riksbank is what is usually known as the 
lender of last resort.

During  the  financial  crisis  several  financial  markets  ceased  functioning.  The  banks’ 
confidence  in  one  another  declined  and  they  became  unwilling  to  lend  to  one  another. 
Developments during the crisis can be illustrated by, for instance, the so-called TED spread, 
the difference between the interest on three-month interbank loans and three-month treasury 
bills. As confidence between the banks declined, the TED spread increased during the crisis 
and peaked when Lehman Brothers fell (Figure 6).  
This meant that it became expensive and difficult for the banks to fund themselves. In this 
situation the Riksbank began to lend money to the banks at longer maturities to secure their 
funding.  During  three  months  in  autumn  2008  the  Riksbank  increased  its  lending  to  the 
banks  by  more  than  around  SEK  450  billion. To  begin  with  the  Riksbank  granted  loans  in 
kronor at three-month and six-month maturities, but gradually the maturities were increased 
to twelve months. Lending at a variable interest rate has declined over the past six months, 
but has been supplemented by the previously-mentioned lending at a fixed interest rate of 
almost SEK 300 billion (Figure 7).

 The Riksbank has also granted loans in US dollars. During the crisis there was a shortage of 
dollars around the world and the banks experienced difficulty in obtaining funding in dollars. 
At  most,  lending  in  dollars  corresponded  to  around  SEK  250  billion  in  spring  2009.  Since 
then the banks’ interest in borrowing dollars from the Riksbank has declined. Quite simply, it 
has become cheaper for the banks to borrow dollars in the market than from the Riksbank, 
which is a sign that the financial markets are gradually functioning better. These loans have 
now ceased. 
For simplicity’s sake I am talking about lending to the banks. But the correct designation for 
the  group  of  institutions  which  can  borrow  from  the  Riksbank  is  monetary  policy 
counterparties. Over the past year we have extended the number of counterparties who can 
act  as  counterparts  in  our  fine-tuning  transactions  and  introduced  a  new  category  of 
counterparties,  known  as  restricted  monetary  policy  counterparties,  who  can  purchase 
BIS Review 160/2009

Riksbank Certificates and take part in the Riksbank’s auctions of loans at longer maturities, 
without being participants in the RIX system.1 We have also given special liquidity assistance 
in autumn 2008 to Kaupthing and Carnegie, which they have since repaid. 
All lending by the Riksbank is against collateral. Over the past year we have extended the 
eligible assets that can be used as collateral, but this still encompasses securities that are 
safe  assets.  The  securities  accepted  are  debt  securities  issued  primarily  by  the  Swedish 
government and by Swedish mortgage institutions. 
All  increased  lending  by  the  Riksbank  ends  up  in  some  form  of  increased  deposit  on  the 
Riksbank’s balance sheet. While there can be long transaction chains, as all payment flows 
in  kronor  go  through  the  banks'  accounts  in  the  RIX  payment  system,  the  money  never 
leaves the system. It is merely moved between the banks’ different deposit accounts with the 
Riksbank.  The  Riksbank’s  lending  in  kronor  to  the  banks  has  thus  been  entirely  funded 
through deposits from the banks (Figure 8).

The interest rates on the banks’ borrowing from the Riksbank, like the previously-discussed 
interest  rates  on  the  Riksbank  Certificates  and  fine-tuning  transactions,  are  related  to  the 
repo  rate.  The  banks  pay  an  interest  rate  that  corresponds  to  the  repo  rate  with  a  certain 
premium.  The  banks  thus  pay  a  higher  interest  rate  for  their  borrowing  from  the  Riksbank 
than they receive in interest on their deposits with the Riksbank. At the most recent auction 
of loans in SEK, for instance, the interest rate was 0.40 per cent for both fixed-interest rate 
loans  and  variable-interest  rate  loans.  As  mentioned  earlier,  the  banks  currently  receive 
interest of 0.25 per cent on Riksbank Certificates and for fine-tuning overnight deposits they 
receive 0.15 per cent. In this way the Riksbank steers market rates by setting the interest 
rates for the Riksbank’s deposits and lending.

The Riksbank’s lending in dollars has been funded by using the foreign currency reserve and 
through  loans  from  the  US  central  bank.  I  will  return  to  this  later.  The  interest  rate  for  the 
dollar  loans  has  been  determined  through  a  premium  on  the  short-term  interest  rate  on 
dollars in the United States. The Riksbank has paid the same interest rate to the US central 
bank.  The  Riksbank’s  dollar  lending  peaked  in  the  spring,  but  has  now  come  to  an  end 
(Figure 9).

 The Riksbank makes a profit on the loans and deposits, through its interest rates. The total 
profit for the Riksbank during the period from the beginning of October 2008 to the end of 
October 2009 amounts to around SEK 2.3 billion. The fact that the Riksbank makes a profit 
on its lending and deposits in kronor is not the purpose of these measures, but rather a side-
effect. At the same time it is important to set the interest rates in a way that avoids directly 
subsidising the bank system. 
In  addition  to  the  Riksbank’s  measures  the  Swedish  banks  have  received  other  forms  of 
support  during  the  financial  crisis.  They  have  also  been  able  to  borrow  from  other  central 
banks.  As  part  of  the  government’s  stability  package,  with  effect  from  December  2008 
financial  institutions  can  apply  to  have  their  borrowing  guaranteed  by  the  government 
through the Swedish National Debt Office. At present nine financial institutions have received 
loans amounting to just over SEK 300 billion with such guarantees. All in all, the bank lending 
supported by the Riksbank and by the Swedish National Debt Office amounted at most to 
almost SEK 800 billion in July this year (Figure 10).

 To summarise, the measures to safeguard financial stability during the financial crisis were 
mainly aimed at quickly providing the banks with wide scale funding in SEK and USD. During 
the crisis the Riksbank has acted in its traditional role as lender of last resort. The difference 
this  time,  compared  with  the  traditional  role,  is  that  it  has  not  merely  involved  short-term 
loans in kronor, but also lending at longer maturities and in dollars. 
Gold and foreign currency reserve  
The  Riksbank  has  a  substantial  gold  and  foreign  currency  reserve.  It  consists  of  gold  and 
assets in different currencies, which can be quickly converted to liquid funds. The main part 
of  the  foreign  currency  reserve  consists  of  securities  in  foreign  currency,  with  a  small 
percentage  of  bonds  issued  by  US  mortgage  institutions  and  some  Australian  states.  The 
currency distribution up to the crisis was that half of the currency reserve was listed in euro, 
20 per cent in US dollars, 10 per cent each in British pounds and Norwegian kronor and 5 
per cent each in Canadian and Australian dollars. During the crisis there has been a greater 
emphasis on euro and dollars. 
The  gold  and  foreign  currency  reserve  serves  three  purposes.  Firstly,  the  Riksbank  has 
traditionally  held  a  gold  and  foreign  currency  reserve  to  be  able  to  support  the  Swedish 
krona’s exchange rate. This was a particularly strong reason up to 1991, when Sweden had 
a fixed exchange rate. But it has no major significance now that we have a floating exchange 
rate and an inflation target.  
Secondly,  a  gold  and  foreign  currency  reserve  is  needed  to  be  able  to  provide  temporary 
liquidity assistance in foreign currency to banks suffering liquidity problems. During the crisis 
the  banks  experienced  problems  with  funding  in  foreign  currency,  particularly  dollars.  The 
Riksbank  therefore  lent  dollars  to  the  Swedish  banks,  partly  funded  through  the  currency 
reserve.

 BIS Review 160/2009
Thirdly, Sweden has international commitments through, for instance, the IMF to be able to 
support  other  countries  in  crisis  with  loans  in  foreign  currency.  These  commitments  have 
increased  substantially  during  the  crisis.  The  Riksbank  has  established  swap  agreements 
with the central banks in Iceland, Latvia and Estonia, to be able to provide loans in foreign 
currency  to  stabilise  the  financial  situation  in  these  countries.  Moreover,  the  Riksbank  has 
increased its commitments to the IMF. All in all, international commitments have increased 
by more than SEK 50 billion in connection with the crisis and they may increase further.  
Prior to the financial crisis the gold and foreign currency reserve amounted to around SEK 
200  billion,  and  then  accounted  for  more  or  less  all  of  the  Riksbank's  assets.  The  foreign 
currency  reserve  has  been  strengthened  this  year.  The  Riksbank  has  borrowed  a  further 
amount in foreign currency through the Swedish National Debt Office, totalling the equivalent 
of around SEK 100 billion. Some of the foreign currency reserve has been lent out during the 
crisis and the value in Swedish kronor has been affected by the depreciation in the krona. 
The size of the foreign currency reserve has thus varied during the crisis (Figure 11).

The gold and foreign currency reserve the Riksbank held prior to the crisis was not sufficient 
to  cover  the  lending  and  the  increased  commitments  occasioned  by  the  crisis.  During  the 
crisis there arose, for instance, a global shortage of dollars. To safeguard the banks’ funding 
in foreign currency the Riksbank – like other central banks – entered into a swap agreement 
for  USD  30  billion,  corresponding  to  around  SEK  200  billion,  with  the  US  central  bank 
(Federal Reserve) to enable it to borrow US dollars in exchange for Swedish kronor. Prior to 
this  the  Riksbank  had  entered  into  a  similar  swap  agreement  for  EUR  10  billion, 
corresponding  to  just  over  SEK  100  billion,  with  the  European  Central  Bank  (ECB)  in 
December 2007, to be able to borrow euro in exchange for Swedish kronor. The Riksbank 
also has the opportunity to borrow currency from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) 
in Basel (Figure 12).

 To  recap,  during  the  financial  crisis  the  Riksbank  has  used  measures  such  as  swap 
agreements with the ECB and Federal Reserve and borrowing through the Swedish National 
Debt  office  to  improve  the  scope  for  providing  the  financial  sector  with  loans  in  foreign 
currency  and  to  meet  its  increased  international  commitments.  All  in  all,  the  reserves 
including the  swap  agreements  have  increased  from  around  SEK  200  billion  to more  than 
SEK  600  billion.  During  the  crisis  the  Riksbank  has  at  most  lent  dollars  corresponding  to 
around SEK 250 billion. 
Banknotes and coins, capital, etc. 
The  Riksbank  has  the  monopoly  on  issuing  banknotes  and  coins  in  Swedish  kronor.  The 
volume of banknotes and coins in circulation is normally the largest item on the liabilities side 
of  the  balance  sheet.  The  size  of  this  item  is  governed  entirely  by  the  general  public’s 
demand for cash and it has not been significantly affected by the financial crisis (Figure 13). 
Banknotes and coins are an important source of funding for the Riksbank. Cash in the form 
of  banknotes  and  coins  does  not  accrue  any  interest  for  the  holders.  The  general  public’s 
holdings  of  banknotes  and  coins  are  entered  into  the  Riksbank’s  balance  sheet  as  an 
interest-free liability. The Riksbank invests a corresponding amount, with a deduction for the 
cost  of  managing  banknotes  and  coins,  in  yield-bearing  financial  assets.  This  equivalent 
amount is in practice part of the foreign currency reserve. The return the Riksbank receives 
on  these  financial  assets  comprises  what  is  known  as  seigniorage  income.  In  2008 
seigniorage  income  amounted  to  around  SEK  5  billion,  which  corresponds  to  a  return  of 
4.6 per cent.

 Another  concept  that  has  been  discussed  to  some  extent  in  connection  with  the  financial 
crisis is what is usually known as the monetary base. This consists of banknotes and coins in 
circulation  plus  the  banks’  deposits  with  the  Riksbank  through  Riksbank  Certificates,  fine-
tuning and standing facilities. During the financial crisis the banks’ deposits with the Riksbank 
increased substantially, as mentioned earlier, when the Riksbank increased its lending to the 
banks. The monetary base has thus increased by around 300 per cent. 
In simpler economic models one usually assume that there is a fixed relationship between 
the monetary base and the money supply.2 The question that has been discussed is whether 
the  large  increase  in  the  monetary  base  could  give  rise  to  rapid  inflation.  But  for  this  to 
happen  the  money  volume  in  society  must  also  increase,  that  is,  as  well  as  the  monetary 
base increasing, the general public’s deposits in the banks must increase. This could happen 
if the increase in the monetary base leads to the banks increasing their credit granting to the 
general public and if this in turn leads to the general public depositing more money with the 
banks.  In  the  prevailing  economic  downturn  this  has  not  been  the  case.  The  banks  have 
tightened  their  credit  granting,  while  demand  for  credit  has  declined,  particularly  from 
companies.  
A  more  reasonable  interpretation  of  what  has  happened  is  that  the  banks  have  increased 
their  demand  for  liquid  reserves  in  the  Riksbank.  Put  simply,  one  can  say  that  the  bank 
system as a whole has borrowed as much from the Riksbank as it is willing to invest as a 
deposit with the Riksbank. Thus, the ratio between the monetary base demanded  and the 
money  supply  has  increased,  or  in  other  words  what  is  known  as  the  credit  multiplier  has 
                                                 
2   Money  supply  here  refers  to  the  general  public’s  holdings  of  banknotes  and  coins  and  the  general  public’s 
deposits with the banks.

declined.  When  the  situation  on  the  financial  markets  normalises  we  expect  the  credit 
multiplier to return to its earlier level (Figure 14).3

The Riksbank’s capital currently amounts to around SEK 64 billion. The return on the capital 
is intended to fund the Riksbank’s activities. It should also cover any losses that might arise 
in  the  Riksbank's  activities.  This  could  be  losses  arising  in  the  daily  management  of  the 
Riksbank's financial assets or when the Riksbank provides liquidity assistance to the banks.  
One  item  on  the  balance  sheet  that  has  increased  over  the  past  year  is  the  revaluation 
account. This is where unrealised gains and losses are booked that comprise the difference 
between the purchase value and current market value of the Riksbank’s assets. As a result 
of the krona having weakened and the price of gold having risen, the value of the gold and 
foreign  currency  reserve  has  increased.  This  increase  in  value  on  the  assets  side 
corresponds on the liabilities side to an increase in the revaluation account (Figure 15).

also the box Unconventional measures and the risk of inflation in the Monetary Policy Report, October 2009, 
Sveriges Riksbank.

The  Riksbank’s  assets  are  managed  to  provide  a  good  return.  The  return  over  the  past 
fifteen years has been around 7 per cent a year. As a result of the assets normally consisting 
mainly of gold and foreign assets, the return in Swedish kronor can vary substantially from 
year to year. The weakening of the krona during the financial crisis has paradoxically meant 
that  the  Riksbank’s  results  have  improved.  In  addition,  the  Riksbank’s  results  have  been 
positively affected by the lending to the banks. Some of the profits are paid as dividends to 
the Treasury. A principle for allocating profits is applied to even out the dividends paid to the 
Treasury.  This  entails  80  per  cent  of  the  average  net  income  for  the  past  five  years, 
excluding exchange rate and gold evaluation effects, being transferred to the Treasury. The 
part of the profits not paid to the Treasury is transferred to the Riksbank’s capital. 
In addition to the items already discussed (Riksbank Certificates, fine-tuning, banknotes and 
coins, capital and revaluation account), there are a number of other items on the liabilities 
side  of  the  balance  sheet.  The  largest  of  these  is  the  debt  to  the  Swedish  National  Debt 
Office  for  the  loan  the  Riksbank  has  taken  to  reinforce  the  foreign  currency  reserve.  The 
other items are normally small and less important. See the appendix with Figures 17 and 18 
the Riksbank’s assets and liabilities.  
Concluding remarks 
In conclusion, I would like to refer to my introduction. The Riksbank has for just over a year 
now taken forceful action to limit the negative consequences of the financial crisis. Monetary 
policy has been aimed at dampening the fall in economic activity; the repo rate has been cut 
to an extremely low level and supplemented with lending to the banks with longer maturities 
to be able to also influence interest rates further along the curve. The measures to safeguard 
financial stability have been aimed at providing the banks with funding in SEK and USD. The 
possibilities to provide the financial sector with loans in foreign currency and to be able to 
meet  the  increased  international  commitments  have  been  reinforced  by  the  swap 
agreements with the ECB and the Federal Reserve and the borrowing through the Swedish 
National Debt Office.

There  are  clearer  signs  that  the  world  economy  is  beginning  to  recover,  and  the  financial 
markets  are  gradually  functioning  better.  As  the  financial  sector  stabilises,  the  need  for 
extraordinary measures will decline. According to the forecast we made in October, the repo 
rate will probably need to begin being raised in autumn 2010 (Figure 16).

 The other question with regard to phasing out the extraordinary measures is when and how 
we should phase out the loans to the banks. The Riksbank, unlike many other central banks, 
has not purchased any securities, which makes phasing out the support measures relatively 
uncomplicated. The dollar loans have already ceased, as it became cheaper for the banks to 
borrow  dollars  on  the  market  than  through  the  Riksbank.  The  loans  in  kronor  may  be 
concluded in October 2010 as long as no decision is taken on new loans. 
The  extraordinary  measures  will  thus  cease  once  the  economy  has  recovered,  and  the 
situation  in  the  financial  sector  has  stabilised.  The  Riksbank’s  balance  sheet  will  then 
decline. However, the financial crisis has shown that we should maintain a greater readiness 
to meet any new problems than we had prior to the crisis. How this might affect the balance 
sheet is a question the Riksbank will be considering over the coming period.
