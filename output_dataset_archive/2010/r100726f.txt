Andrew Sentance: UK monetary policy – how long should “The song 
remain the same”? 
Speech by Mr Andrew Sentance, Member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of 
England, to the Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce Group, Reading, 13 July 2010. 
 I would like to thank Michael Hume, Tomasz Wieladek and Abi Hughes for research assistance and I am also 
grateful for helpful comments from other colleagues. The views expressed are my own and do not necessarily 
reflect those of the Bank of England or other members of the Monetary Policy Committee. 
It is a great pleasure to be speaking to a business audience here in Reading, in the heart of 
the Thames Valley. This is an extremely successful economic region – with the highest GDP 
per head in the United Kingdom outside central London and the 14th most prosperous region 
in  the  whole  of  the  European  Union.1  This  track  record  of  economic  success  reflects  a 
concentration  of  high-tech  and  knowledge-based  industries,  particularly  in  the  information 
and  communications  technologies  sector.  The  Thames  Valley  economy  also  benefits  from 
good  transport  links  to  London,  other  parts  of  the  UK  and  international  connections  via 
Heathrow Airport, which is still Europe’s biggest aviation hub in terms of passenger numbers. 
It  is  not  surprising,  therefore,  that  a  number  of  recent  reports  have  highlighted  the  growth 
potential  of  this  region  in  the  current  recovery.  According  to  the  Work  Foundation,  the 
Reading  and  Bracknell  area  is  assessed  to  have  the  best  job  growth  potential  of  any  UK 
urban conurbation and Swindon and Oxford also make the top 10 in their league table.2 
When  I  accepted  the  invitation  to  give  today’s  speech,  I  had  not  appreciated  that  today  
– 13th July – was a significant date in terms of my career and my position on the Monetary 
Policy  Committee  (MPC).  Four  years  ago  today,  on  13th  July  2006, Gordon  Brown  –  who 
was  then  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  –  announced  my  appointment  in  Parliament,  and  I 
joined the Committee just over two months later. 
The course of monetary policy while I have been on the Committee has been dominated by 
the effects of the global financial crisis, and the recession which ensued. It has also been a 
period when the Committee has found it more difficult to keep inflation on target than in the 
more stable global conditions which prevailed until 2007. In 36 out of the 45 months I have 
served on the Committee, CPI inflation has been above the 2% target. And it has been more 
than  one  percentage  point  above  the  target  –  the  threshold  which  triggers  an  explanatory 
letter from the Governor of the Bank of England to the Chancellor – in 15 months, a third of 
the time that I have been on the Committee. That includes June’s inflation rate which was 
announced earlier today. 
The normal monetary policy reaction to a sustained period of above target inflation would be 
to tighten policy, to create demand conditions which are more conducive to restraining price 
increases and bringing inflation back to target. But so far, the Committee has not supported 
that course of action – and is keeping monetary policy extremely loose. Bank Rate remains 
at the exceptionally low level of 0.5%, the lowest official interest rate recorded since the Bank 
of  England  was  established  over  300  years  ago.  And  the  Committee  is  also  currently 
maintaining  the  boost  to  demand  from  the  injection  of  £200bn  of  new  money  into  the 
economy through Quantitative Easing.

Last month, however, I dissented from this approach and voted for a small rise in interest 
rates.  And  in  today’s  speech  I  want  to  set  out  the  thinking  behind  my  view  of  current 
economic prospects and the implications for UK monetary policy that led me to that decision. 
The monetary policy response to the global financial crisis 
The current stance of monetary policy in place in the UK, and in many other countries, was 
put in place as the response to the recession triggered by the global financial crisis. Starting 
in the autumn of 2008 and continuing into the early months of 2009, demand – in the UK and 
globally  –  weakened  very  sharply.  Consumers  and  firms  held  back  spending  plans  in  the 
wake of the massive negative confidence shocks associated with the events surrounding the 
collapse of Lehman Brothers and the knock-on effects on the rest of the financial system. 
Along  with  the  rest  of  the  MPC,  I  strongly  supported  the  decision  to  reduce  interest  rates 
from 5% to 0.5% between October 2008 and March 2009, and to inject extra money into the 
economy through Quantitative Easing. The bulk of this money injection (£175bn of the total 
£200bn) was agreed by the time of the August 2009 Inflation Report, which was published 
just under a year ago. Though that Report looked forward to a recovery in the economy, very 
little economic data available at that time pointed in that direction. Rather, the economic data 
last summer were telling us how sharply the economy had contracted in late 2008 and the 
first half of 2009 both at home and abroad, and how sharply unemployment had risen as a 
result. 
A strong theme underpinning the analysis of both the May and August Inflation Reports last 
year was that UK inflation was expected to be pushed significantly below target by a large 
margin of spare capacity. These reports showed fan charts in which inflation was much more 
likely to be below the target than above it throughout the two to three year horizon over which 
the Bank produces its forecasts. The central projection in both Inflation Reports we produced 
last summer suggested inflation would fall to around 1% or just above in the first half of 2011 
and to struggle to return to the target after that. 
This was the economic backdrop against which I and other members of the MPC took the 
key decisions to put in place the monetary policy settings which we currently have in place 
today: sharp falls in demand and rises in unemployment;  great uncertainty about  recovery 
prospects; and a general expectation of persistent below target inflation. The Bank was not 
alone in its prognosis – this was the general view of the forecasting consensus last summer. 
A year on, however, the economic situation has changed. There are still many uncertainties 
about future economic prospects. But there are four features of the current position of the 
economy which are now very different from the situation we faced last summer – the world 
economy  has  bounced  back,  the  UK  economy  is  also  recovering,  the  margin  of  spare 
capacity does not appear to be as large as we had expected a year ago, and inflation has 
run above target rather than falling below it. Before moving on to talk about monetary policy, I 
will briefly discuss these four factors in turn. 
Recovery in the world economy 
Over the past year or so, the world economy has bounced back strongly, led by growth in 
Asia  but  also  supported  by  recovery  in  the  US  and  a  more  gradual  turnaround  in  the 
European economy. Consensus forecasts for 2010 growth in the three main regions of the 
world economy have improved significantly over the last twelve months, as Chart 1 shows. 
The US economy is now projected to grow by over 3% this year, and GDP in Japan is also 
projected  to  rise  at  a  similar  rate  –  very  strong  by  comparison  with  its  recent  poor  growth 
performance.  True,  the  European  economies  appear  to  be  lagging  behind  in  this  global 
recovery.  But  even  is  this  region  of  the  world  economy,  the  growth  outlook  has  improved

compared with last summer when average growth in the European economies in 2010 was 
projected to be barely above zero.

Last week, the IMF updated its growth forecasts and these showed a further uprating of their 
expectations  for  growth  this  year  across  the  world  economy,  though  they  also  highlighted 
some of the risks looking ahead. The latest IMF projections are now for world growth of 4.6% 
in 2010 and 4.3% in 2011. These growth rates are actually slightly above the average growth 
in the period of expansion before the crisis, with world growth averaging 4% from 2000 to 
2008.  It  is  unfortunate  for  the  UK  that  our  main  export  markets  are  in  Europe,  which  is 
lagging  behind  the  global  recovery.  But  UK  exporters  do  have  the  offsetting  benefit  of  a 
relatively competitive exchange rate against the euro. And recent data from manufacturing 
industry  and  from  business  surveys  shows  that  this  combination  of  global  recovery  and  a 
competitive exchange rate is beginning to be reflected in strong export performance.3 
There are still clearly uncertainties about the evolution of the global recovery, and the data 
over  the  last  month  seems  to  be  consistent  with  some  easing  back  in  the  rate  of  global 
expansion in the second half of this year. But these worries about possible unevenness in 
the  pace  of  global  growth  should  not  be  confused  with  signs  of  a  “double-dip”  recession, 
which in my view is not on the cards. Rather, the world economy has bounced back strongly 
from recession over the past twelve months, and much more strongly than forecasts a year 
ago suggested.4 
                                                 
3   The latest quarterly GDP figures, released on 12 July, suggest that recent export performance in the services 
sector may have been relatively weak, but early estimates of exports of services are not particularly reliable. 
4   The  current  IMF  forecast  of  world  GDP  growth  of  4.6%  in  2010  compares  with  their  April  2009  forecast  of 
1.9%.

   Turnaround in the UK economy 
Alongside this improvement in the international economy, the UK economy has also turned 
around  since  last  summer.  Business  surveys  and  the  labour  market  data  have  been 
suggesting  a  return  to  growth  since  the  second  half  of  last  year.  The  official  estimates  of 
GDP  still  show  a  fairly  modest  recovery,  starting  in  the  final  quarter  of  2009  –  though  the 
estimates  of  real  GDP  growth  that  we  currently  have  over  the  recovery  period  are  very 
provisional  and  may  indeed  be  revised  in  the  future.  That  is  what  happened  in  the  early 
1990s recovery, where the picture we now have of growth in the early stages of that recovery 
– in 1992 and 1993 – are very different from the initial estimates. 
One of the concerns that the MPC had a year ago when policy was being loosened was the 
sharp fall in measures of nominal demand – the growth of spending in money terms, before 
adjusting for inflation. As the recession took hold, GDP and other measures of demand not 
only fell in real terms, but they fell in nominal or money terms too. One of the key reasons for 
embarking on the policy of Quantitative Easing was to reverse this downward shift in money 
spending, which would have pulled down inflation sharply if it had continued. 
As Chart 3 shows, this trend in nominal demand has indeed reversed. GDP and domestic 
demand  measured  in  money  terms  rose  at  an  annualised  rate  of  around  5.5%  in  the  last 
3 quarters for which we have data, and total final expenditure – which also includes export 
demand – grew by nearly 7%. On all the three main measures of nominal demand, growth is 
now back to or above  the pre-recession average rate. This is a rapid turnaround from the 
sharp falls seen in late 2008 and early 2009.

Business  surveys  are  also  showing  a  generally  positive  picture.  Chart  4  shows  the  latest 
responses from the British Chambers of Commerce’s survey – which points to a particularly 
strong  rebound  in  manufacturing,  with  a  slower  recovery  in  the  services  sector.  But  both 
manufacturing and services are showing a return to growth, alongside positive expectations 
that the recovery in demand will continue.

The CBI’s most recent surveys show a similar picture, with manufacturing industry bouncing 
back strongly alongside a muted recovery in the services sector (see Chart 5). According to 
the CBI, retail sales growth appears to have been weak in the last couple of months – though 
this may reflect some temporary uncertainties relating to the change of government and the 
Budget, which could have affected consumer confidence and spending patterns.

I would not want to play down the uncertainties which remain in relation to the growth outlook 
here  in  the  UK.  Access  to  credit  is  still  being  adversely  affected  by  the  problems  in  the 
banking system. And public spending, which has supported demand in the recession will be 
significantly  restricted,  particularly  from  next  financial  year  onwards.  That  makes  it  all  the 
more important that the private sector can act as a strong engine of growth – both in terms of 
spending and other supply side indicators – such as employment, innovation and enterprise. 
In this respect, I very much welcome the emphasis in George Osborne’s Emergency Budget 
on reducing the business tax burden – by keeping down employers’ national insurance and 
cutting the corporation tax rate. These and other measures should be helpful in sustaining 
private  sector  confidence  and  growth  as  the  public  sector  undertakes  a  long  process  of 
structural adjustment. 
Unemployment and spare capacity 
A  third  area  where  the  evidence  has  turned  out  somewhat  differently  from  expectations  a 
year ago is in terms of measures of spare capacity in the economy. Unemployment has been 
pushed up by the recession, but by less than in earlier downturns. The UK unemployment 
rate  is  currently  around  8%  of  the  labour  force,  whereas  it  peaked  at  much  higher  levels 
6 
 BIS Review 99/2010
following  the  last  two  recessions  –  at  nearly  12%  in  the mid-1980s and  between  10  and 
11%  in  the  early  1990s.  At  the  equivalent  stage  of  the  cycle  following  the  previous  two 
recessions, unemployment was already over 10% of the labour force.5 The evidence from 
the Bank of England’s Agents and recent employment surveys is that the labour market in 
the  UK  has  stabilised  and  that  labour  demand  in  the  private  sector  may  have  already 
started to pick up. 
Companies also seem to have adjusted quickly to a lower level of demand and activity in the 
recession, and the most recent surveys do not point to an unusually large margin of spare 
capacity  remaining  within  firms.  For  example,  the  latest  CBI  survey  shows  62%  of 
manufacturers reporting some spare capacity – which is virtually in line with the average for 
the decade before the financial crisis.6  
The evidence on wages and prices is also consistent with the view that spare capacity is not 
exerting as much downward pressure on inflation as the MPC expected last summer. In the 
manufacturing sector, underlying wage growth is back up to the 4–5% level already, though 
is more subdued in the services sector. And after quite widespread pay freezes last year, the 
latest pay settlements data from Income Data Services show that the most popular range for 
pay settlements is currently 2–3%, which is where four out of ten pay settlements are now 
being struck. If the recovery continues and headline inflation remains relatively high, there 
may  be  a  further  upward  drift  in  pay  growth  in  the  private  sector,  offsetting  some  of  the 
downward pressure on wage growth from the public sector. 
UK inflation performance 
That  brings  me  to  the  final  area  where  the  UK  economy  has  performed  very  differently  to 
expectations  last  summer  –  headline  inflation.  The  UK  has  just  experienced  the  second 
significant upward spike in inflation in the last couple of years. Since the beginning of 2008, 
when the financial crisis and the ensuing recession might have been expected to push down 
inflation,  consumer  price  inflation  in  the  UK  has  averaged  3%  –  above  the  2%  target  and 
more than one percentage point higher than average CPI inflation in the pre-recession period 
of growth. 
Our inflation rate is clearly influenced by external factors in the world economy, such as a 
volatile oil price, and these have clearly made the control of inflation more difficult over the 
last two or three years. But if these global forces were solely to blame for higher inflation, 
they would be having a similar effect in other major economies. As Chart 6 shows, the US 
and the euro area have seen lower and more stable inflation over the last couple of years, 
with inflation averaging around 1¾% since the beginning of 2008. US inflation has recently 
been  pushed  up  to  over  2%  by  higher  petrol  prices,  but  to  a  much  lesser  extent  than  in  
the UK. 
                                                 
5   According to the Labour Force Survey measure, unemployment peaked at 11.9% in mid-1984 and 10.6% in 
early 1993. Approximately two years after the start of the recession in both cases, unemployment was 10.2% 
at end-1981 and 10.4% at end-1992. 
In the April 2010 quarterly Industrial Trends Survey, 62% of manufacturers reported that they were working 
below capacity. The average figure for the decade 1998–2007 was 61%.

One obvious reason for this higher level of UK inflation is the weakness of the pound. Since 
mid-2007, the pound has lost nearly a fifth of  its value against the euro and has  fallen by 
around 25% against the dollar. Indeed, as Chart 7 shows, looking back over the last three 
years,  the  pound  has  been  the  weakest  currency  in  the  whole  G20  group  of  currencies, 
declining more against the US dollar than the Argentine Peso and the Turkish Lira.

 BIS Review 99/2010
There are structural explanations of why the pound has fallen so far, including the potentially 
high exposure of our economy to the financial crisis and its associated effects. But another 
contributory factor could be the stance of monetary policy, as changes in the exchange rate 
are an important channel for the transmission of monetary policy. So we need to recognise 
that the weakness of the pound – and its upward impact on inflation – may also have been 
affected by UK monetary policy and perceptions about its future stance. 
Implications for UK monetary policy 
In four important respects, therefore, I believe the economic world has changed significantly 
since  we  put  in  place  the  current  set  of  monetary  policy  settings  last  year.  The  world 
economy has bounced back, demand is recovering in the UK, there is less spare capacity 
than we feared and inflation has been higher. 
But monetary policy needs to be forward looking, so that does not add up to a compelling 
case  for  a  change  in  monetary  policy.  The  question  is  how  has  the  growth  and  inflation 
outlook changed as a result. 
In my experience, recoveries have momentum. While growth might not be totally steady and 
even across sectors, as recovery progresses, various mechanisms begin to operate which 
can  give  it  added  momentum.  Pressure  on  existing  capacity  grows,  causing  companies  to 
dust off their investment plans. Supply chains tighten and firms start to re-stock. Memories of 
the  uncertainty  created  by  the  shocks  that  generated  the  recession  fades  and  confidence 
recovers.  The  labour  market  stabilises  and  unemployment  should  eventually  start  to  fall, 
improving job prospects. These things happen over a period of time, so from month to month 
not much change may be perceptible. But looking back over a longer period, improvement is 
clear. 
In my view, this is the process that has been underway for the last year, and this process of 
gradual  healing  and  recovery  is  likely  to  continue  in  the  absence  of  big  negative  shocks 
which could derail growth. Given our experience over the last few years, we should certainly 
worry  about  future  major  shocks  from  the  international  economy.  But  the  big  downside 
worries resulting from the financial crisis which were present a year ago have receded, in my 
assessment. And the response of monetary policy has played a part in that process – though 
it has not been the only factor at work. The positive “animal spirits” – which Keynes believed 
drove economies forward through their impact on business and consumer confidence – do 
have a natural tendency to reassert themselves after major shocks.  
The big worries about the future stability of the financial system in late 2008 and the first half 
of  2009  seem  to  have  been  replaced  by  an  underlying  structural  nervousness  in  financial 
markets.  So,  as  we  have  seen  over  the  last  few  months,  we  are  bound  to  experience 
setbacks in financial sentiment from time to time. This is entirely understandable given the 
shocks  we  have  seen  in  recent  years.  We  may  need  to  be  prepared  to  live  with  this 
nervousness  for  some time  to  come  –  and it  should  not  be  the  dominant  influence  on  the 
policy and judgements of the MPC, which should be based on the performance of the real 
economy and the outlook for inflation. 
The MPC has a clear remit, which is to keep inflation on target at 2% over the medium term. 
Our  framework  recognises  this  will  not  always  be  possible,  but  what  we  need  to  do  is  to 
maintain confidence that inflation will still be anchored around this target in the future. A year 
ago, the predominant worry was that inflation could be significantly depressed by the impact 
of the recession. That risk did not materialise. And while I’m not yet worried that we face a 
major  and  serious  risk  in  the  opposite  direction,  I  do  think  we  need  to  adjust  the  policy 
settings we put in place to head off the downside risks to inflation identified in the immediate 
aftermath of the big financial shocks in late 2008 and early 2009. 
It  is  possible  to  describe  this  challenge  in  different  ways  –  as  a  gradual  “normalisation”  of 
policy or a gradual withdrawal of policy stimulus. Words which I don’t think create the right 
BIS Review 99/2010

impression in the current environment – particularly in relation to an upward move of Bank 
Rate  from  0.5%  to  0.75%  –  are  “rate  hike”  or  “tightening”  of  policy.  “Rate  hike”  implies  a 
sharp rise in interest rates, which is not what I favour. I favour a gradual rise in Bank Rate 
which  would  be  aimed  to  avoid  destabilising  confidence  through  a  sudden  lurch  in  policy. 
“Tightening”  may  be  technically  correct  as  the  opposite  of  “loosening”  but  it  implies  that 
monetary  policy  might  become  objectively  tight  and  restrain  the  growth  of  the  economy 
significantly. Again, that is not my view about the policy stance we currently need. 
So  how  should  we  characterise  the  current  challenge  in  front  of  the  MPC?  The  Bank 
Governor, Mervyn King, is fond of sporting analogies. But I have always been pretty useless 
at sport and my greatest interest outside of my working life is music, and in particular rock 
music.  Indeed,  the  first  time  I  came  to  Reading  was  in  1977  when  I  was  supporting  a 
pub-rock band called Sounder, who persuaded me to drive the band members to a gig in the 
town centre. 
Also  around  that  time,  the  great  rock  band  Led  Zeppelin  released  a  film  and  soundtrack 
album called “The Song Remains the Same” – featuring their live performances around the 
world in the mid-1970s. The question in my mind now is how long the monetary policy song 
can remain the same, when it might be out of tune with the rest of the background music 
from the real economy – of economic recovery and above target inflation.  
That Led Zeppelin album “The Song Remains the Same” contained an extremely long live 
version (lasting nearly half an hour!) of a track which appeared on their first album – entitled 
“Dazed and Confused”, in which Jimmy Page plays his guitar with a violin bow – something I 
must  say  that  I  have  not  attempted  in  my  guitar-playing  career.  There  have  been  many 
aspects of the current financial crisis and the recent performance of the economy which have 
left  us  all  “dazed  and  confused”.  The  financial  crisis  has  served  as  a  severe  jolt  to  the 
prevailing view in the mid-2000s that the economy had entered a period of “Great Stability” of 
steady  growth  and  low  inflation.  As  I  have  argued  in  earlier  speeches,  the  globalised 
economy  we  now  inhabit  may  have  many  potential  sources  of  instability,  including  the 
potential  upside  pressure  on  energy  and  commodity  prices  as  well  as  volatility  in  financial 
markets.7 
In  addition, we  have  learned  through  this  recession that  inflation  has  not  performed  in  the 
way conventional economic models and our earlier forecasts suggested. As spare capacity 
has not exerted much downward pressure on inflation so far, there must be a high degree of 
uncertainty about its future impact. In the highly integrated world economy we now inhabit, 
the  margin  of  spare  capacity  in  the  UK  economy  may  have  less  impact  on  our  inflation 
prospects than global inflationary pressures – which have been less benign in recent years. 
And the exchange rate can play a key role in the transmission of these global price pressures 
to  the  UK  economy,  which  may  help  to  explain  the  above-target  inflation  the  UK  has 
experienced in the last three years. 
For  a  legendary  rock  band  like  Led  Zeppelin,  the  song  should  indeed  remain  the  same. 
When  the  band  reformed  at  the  end  of  2007  at  the  O2  Arena,  everyone  wanted  to  hear 
“Stairway to Heaven”, “Dazed and Confused”, “Whole Lotta Love” and their other classics. 
But  in  monetary  policy,  we  need  to  adapt  our  tune  to  the  changing  performance  of  the 
economy,  and  to  absorb  what  we  learn  about  the  economy  in  new  and  unprecedented 
circumstances, such as the recent financial crisis. In my view, that now points to a gradual 
withdrawal  of  some  of  the  stimulus  we  provided  to  the  economy  in  more  difficult 
circumstances last year – not so much as to undermine the recovery, but to keep it on a low 
inflation path, consistent with the Committee’s remit.
