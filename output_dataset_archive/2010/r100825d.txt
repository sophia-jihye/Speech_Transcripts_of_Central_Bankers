Svante Öberg: The current economic situation 
Speech by Mr Svante Öberg, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Swedbank, 
Stockholm, 20 August 2010. 
 In  this  presentation  I  shall  begin  with  an  account  of  the  Riksbank’s  assessment  of  the 
economic situation abroad. I shall then discuss our assessment of economic developments 
in Sweden. These are the assessments we made at the monetary policy meeting on 30 June 
and published in our Monetary Policy Report on 1 July this year. I will also comment on new 
information received during the summer, but I will not make any new overall assessment of 
economic developments. We members of the Executive Board will not do this until the next 
monetary policy meeting, which will be held on 1 September. Finally, I shall report how the 
majority of Executive Board members and I personally viewed monetary policy at the end of 
June. 
My presentation of the current economic situation can be briefly summarised in three points: 
The  Swedish  economy  is  developing  strongly  after  the  deep  recession  we  have 
 
experienced. Inflationary pressures are currently low, but inflation is expected to rise 
as resource utilisation increases. 
At the most recent monetary policy meeting in June the members of the Executive 
Board decided to raise the repo rate to 0.50 per cent, and assessed that it would 
thereafter need to continue to rise towards more normal levels. The earlier extensive 
lending to the banks is being phased out. 
New  information  supports  the  Riksbank’s  view  that  the  global  economy  and  the 
Swedish economy are recovering. However, there are some signs of weakness in 
the United States and Asia, while Europe looks slightly stronger than expected. The 
unease on the financial markets has waned, but the situation is still not normal. 
  However, I shall begin by discussing international developments. 
International developments 
In  the  Riksbank’s  Monetary  Policy  Report  earlier  in  the  summer  we  painted  a  picture  of 
international developments over the coming years that can be briefly summarised as follows: 
GDP growth will be strong in the world as a whole, but in Europe GDP growth will be modest 
and the upturn will start from a very low level. Inflation abroad will be relatively low. But these 
are  of  course  just  rough  outlines.  Behind  them  lie  more  detailed  analyses  and  reasoning, 
which I will now go on to develop. 
Recovery in world economy – strong growth in Asia 
The recovery in the world economy is continuing. The rate of the recovery varies, of course, 
from country to country and region to region, but for the world as a whole we were expecting 
in June an annual GDP growth of just over 4 per cent over the coming three years. (Figure: 
Global GDP growth) 
The IMF’s most recent update to the forecasts for the world economy, in July this year, even 
implies  a  slightly  higher  growth  rate  this  year  and  next  year.  Since  April  the  IMF  has  also 
made an upward adjustment to its forecasts for this year’s global GDP growth. However, the 
IMF is expecting much higher GDP growth in what is known as the BRIC countries – that is, 
Brazil, Russia, India and China – than in the more developed countries. (Figure: GDP growth 
in the BRIC countries).

Growth in Asia was also very strong at the beginning of the year. During the first quarter, the 
Asian growth economies expanded by the equivalent of an annual growth rate of 10 per cent. 
It is primarily demand from China that has benefitted other countries in the region. However, 
new  statistics  for  the  second  quarter  imply  that  China’s  GDP  growth  has  slowed  down, 
compared with the first quarter, which may imply some slowdown in Asia. GDP in Japan was 
also lower than expected during the second quarter of this year. 
Growth in the USA slowing down 
The US economy is also growing at a good rate after the GDP fall in 2009: our latest forecast 
is that GDP in the United States will increase by 3.2 per cent this year. One reason for this is 
the  strong  economic  policy  stimulation.  However,  our  assessment  at  the  end  of  June  was 
that growth will slow down somewhat in 2011 and 2012, as the effects of the economic policy 
stimulation in the United States wane. (Figure: GDP growth in the USA). 
Since we published our Monetary Policy Report in July, new statistics have been published, 
which  indicate  that  US  growth  is  already  beginning  to  slow  down.  According  to  the 
preliminary  National  Accounts  for  the  second  quarter  of  this  year,  GDP  increased  by 
0.6 per cent compared with the first quarter, which is marginally less than the 0.7 per cent we 
were expecting, and less than during the first quarter. Employment in the private sector rose 
in July, but was still slightly lower than expected. US unemployment remained unchanged at 
the same time, at 9.5 per cent. 
There are also other signs of weakness. The housing market has not yet begun to recover 
from the deep fall in connection with the financial crisis. The purchasing managers’ index for 
the  manufacturing  industry  in  the  United  States  fell  from  59.7  in  May  to  56.2  in  June  and 
55.5 in July. Although an index figure above 50 indicates growth in the sector, these listings 
are the lowest since December 2009. (Figure: Purchasing managers’ index). 
Inflation in the United States has fallen in recent months. Measured in terms of the consumer 
price  index,  inflation  was  1.2  per  cent,  but  when  foods  and  energy  are  excluded,  it  was 
unchanged at 0.9 per cent. The relatively low inflation is linked to the low resource utilisation 
in the United States, among other things. Wages are also subdued. (Figure: Inflation in the 
USA). 
The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, noted at its most recent monetary policy meeting 
on  10  August  that  the  recovery  has  slowed  down  and  that  inflation  has  fallen  in  recent 
months. The Federal Reserve’s assessment was therefore that the recovery will be slightly 
weaker  during  the  coming  period  than  was  previously  anticipated.  At  the  same  time,  the 
Federal Reserve repeated that it would hold its policy rate low for a longer period of time. 
They also notified that – unlike the ECB and the Riksbank – they will be holding the size of 
their balance sheet unchanged by reinvesting the funds the central bank receives when its 
holdings of securities mature in long-term government bonds. The Federal Reserve is thus 
postponing the start of its normalisation of monetary policy, compared with earlier indications. 
(Figure: Central banks’ balance sheets). 
Weak but rising growth in Europe 
According to the Riksbank’s forecast in June, GDP growth in the world as a whole will be 
strong. However, growth in our own region will be modest. The Riksbank’s assessment was 
that GDP growth in the euro area will be 0.8 per cent this year, but that it will increase in 
2011 and 2012. (Figure: GDP growth in the euro area). 
The  factor  behind  the  upturn  in  the  euro  area  is  exports.  Exports  benefit  from  the  strong 
growth in Asia and from the fact that the euro has weakened in relation to other currencies. 
But at the same time, the public finances problems in several European countries have led to 
a number of fiscal tightening packages, which will subdue domestic demand in the coming 
period. I shall return to this later.

 BIS Review 109/2010
Since our Monetary Policy Report was published, Eurostat has reported a flash estimate for 
GDP growth in the euro area for the second quarter of this year. This showed an increase in 
GDP growth of 1.0 per cent, compared with the first quarter, which was much more than the 
0.3 per cent we were expecting, and much stronger than during the first quarter. The average 
level  of  GDP  growth  in  the  euro  area  was  high  thanks  to  very  high  growth  in  Germany. 
Moreover, the purchasing managers’ index for the manufacturing industry in the euro area 
rose  to  56.7  per  cent  in  July.  The  economic  recovery  is  also  continuing  in  our  Nordic 
neighbouring countries. 
Inflation in the euro area was 1.7 per cent in July, measured in terms of the EU-harmonised 
consumer  price  index,  the  HICP,  which  may  be  considered  a  relatively  high  inflation  rate 
given the low resource utilisation in the EU. But if one disregards energy and unprocessed 
foods, inflation was only 1.0 per cent in July, which is largely the same inflation rate as earlier 
in the year. (Figure: Inflation in the euro area). 
Continued recovery in the world economy 
To  summarise  the  international  economic  situation  one  can  say  that  the  new  information 
published  during  the  summer  largely  supports  the  picture  painted  by  the  Riksbank  of  a 
continuing  recovery  in  the  world  economy.  But  there  are  some  signs  of  weakness  in  the 
United States and Asia, while Europe looks slightly stronger than expected. 
Large deterioration in public finances in many countries 
There were concerns at the monetary policy meeting in June over the possible consequences 
of the public finance problems in several countries. During the spring these problems had led 
to increased risk premiums in the financial markets and caused difficulties for many banks. In a 
worst case scenario, this could lead to a much weaker development abroad, which would also 
affect Sweden. I said at the monetary policy meeting that in this case we must be prepared to 
reconsider  the  direction  for  our  monetary  policy.  Given  this,  I  shall  now  specifically  discuss 
public finance problems and developments in the financial markets. 
Deficits in public finances and national debts have increased rapidly in many countries during 
the economic crisis. (Figure: Public finances in the OECD area). 
Developments  have  been  dramatic  for  some  countries,  and  especially  so  for  Greece.  The 
poorer public finances have pushed up government bond rates and are making it difficult or 
almost  impossible  to  fund  the  large  deficits.  Many  other  countries  are  also  experiencing 
serious  problems.  To  improve  their  public  finances  these  countries  are  now  implementing 
strict budget tightening, which is necessary to attain a stable long-term development in public 
finances.  But  at  the  same  time,  the  budget  constraints  will  in  the  short  term  subdue  GDP 
growth, particularly in the euro area. (Figure: Interest rate differential against Germany). 
Concerns over losses in the banking sector 
The  problems  have  also  affected  the  banking  sector.  Banks  normally  include  government 
securities among their assets, which means that they risk suffering losses if the countries to 
which they are exposed have problems managing their debt. As the public finances problems 
became increasingly acute in several areas during the spring, the market focused more on 
the  exposures  of  the  European  banks  to  the  countries  with  the  greatest  problems.  The 
uncertainty over which banks risked making losses pushed up risk premiums on interbank 
loans. This was reflected in the basis spread, that is, the difference between the interbank 
rate and the expected policy rate. During the latter part of April and May the basis spreads in 
the euro market and the United States rose. (Figure: Basis spread). 
BIS Review 109/2010

One measure of how the financial markets assess banks’ credit ratings is the premiums paid 
for what are known as CDS – credit default swaps1. High premiums here entail a high credit 
risk.  During  the  spring  the  CDS  premiums  for  the  European  banks  rose,  particularly  in 
Greece  and  Portugal,  but  also  in  Spain  and  Italy.  An  increased  credit  risk  means  that  it 
becomes more difficult and more expensive for the banks concerned to fund themselves on 
the credit markets, which can hold back lending. This also dampens the real economies in 
the countries concerned. (Figure: CDS premiums for the banks). 
Reduced concern, but still not normal 
In  an  attempt  to  assess  the  stability  of  the  banking  sector  the  Committee  of  European 
Banking Supervisors, CEBS, carried out stress tests on 91 European banks in July this year. 
The results of these stress tests have now been published. The assessment is that all but 
7 banks have sufficient resilience to manage a worse scenario in the period 2010–2011. The 
CEBS has here assumed a weaker economic growth, higher interest rates and poorer stock 
market than in the European Commission’s forecasts, as well as losses linked to the banks’ 
holdings  of  European  government  bonds.  The  four  major  Swedish  banks  included  in  the 
survey managed all of the stress tests with a good margin.2 
The results of the stress tests have generally been well-received by the market. However, it 
should  also  be  pointed  out  that  there  has  been  some  criticism,  which  has  concerned  the 
CEBS’  assumptions  not  being  sufficiently  tough.  Nevertheless,  interest  rate  differentials 
towards Germany declined after the CEBS reported its results, as did the basis spreads and 
the CDS premiums for banks in the four countries concerned, although they have risen again 
in  August  and  the  levels  remain  higher  than  they  were  in  the  spring.  However,  during  the 
summer the countries affected have managed relatively well in issuing government bonds, 
and  the  banks’  interim  reports  have  been  positive.  The  European  Central  Bank  has  been 
able to reduce both its purchases of government bonds and its lending to the banks. 
The  general  picture  is,  to  summarise,  that  the  unease  in  the  financial  markets  has  been 
subdued during the summer, at the same time as the situation is still not normal. 
From this international perspective I shall now move on to a national one, and take a look at 
economic developments in Sweden. 
Economic developments in Sweden 
At the beginning of this presentation I summarised the picture of developments in Sweden 
painted  in  the  Riksbank’s  Monetary  Policy  Report.  The  Swedish  economy  is  developing 
strongly following the severe downturn. GDP was expected to grow relatively quickly over the 
coming  years,  and  the  labour  market  was  expected  to  improve.  Inflationary  pressures  are 
currently low, but are expected to increase as resource utilisation rises. I will now describe 
developments in the Swedish economy in a little more detail, and at the same time discuss 
new information received during the summer. 
                                                 
1  Somewhat simplified, one can say that a CDS is a contract where the buyer pays the seller a premium for the 
seller to take on the credit risk linked to an underlying asset, such as a bond. The premium then becomes a 
measure of the credit risk. 
2  For the banks to manage the stress test their Tier 1 capital ratio, that is, their Tier 1 capital in relation to their 
risk-weighted  liabilities,  must  not  fall  below  6  per  cent.  In  the  stress  test  the  major  Swedish  banks  were 
calculated to have Tier 1 capital ratios of 8.9–10.3 at the end of the test period.

 BIS Review 109/2010
Strong GDP growth 
The Riksbank’s Monetary Policy Report from July forecasts relatively high GDP growth in the 
coming years: that Swedish GDP will grow by 3.8 per cent this year, and then by on average 
just over 3 per cent a year in 2011 and 2012. (Figure: GDP growth). 
We  could  also  note  that  the  first  quarter  of  the  year  had  been  better  than  expected.  It  is 
particularly pleasing that the upturn was on a broad front – all of the components of GDP 
contributed  to  the  upturn.  Moreover,  the  Riksbank  also  saw  good  opportunities  for  a 
continuing  recovery.  Domestic  demand  is  being  maintained  by  a  continued  expansionary 
economic policy, combined with an optimistic view of the future in both the household and 
corporate sectors. In addition, growth abroad is expected to rise during the forecast period. 
This will contribute to an increased demand for Swedish export products, which in turn will 
benefit business sector investment as resource utilisation rises. 
Our  picture  of  a  recovery  in  the  Swedish  economy  is  also  supported  by  new  statistics 
published after the Monetary Policy Report. According to Statistics Sweden’s first preliminary 
compilation  of  the  National  Accounts  for  the  second  quarter  of  this  year,  Swedish  GDP 
increased  by  1.2  per  cent,  compared  with  the  first  quarter  (seasonally-adjusted).  This  is 
slightly more than the 0.9 per cent we have assumed in our report, and also slightly more 
than other forecasters have expected. GDP has thus increased for five quarters in a row and 
has recovered half of the large fall totalling 8 per cent that took place during the previous five 
quarters. (Figure: GDP per quarter). 
The picture of continued good growth is also supported by the National Institute of Economic 
Research’s Economic Tendency Survey, which was presented at the end of July. Although 
the indicator fell between June and July this year, the fall was marginal and the indicator still 
points  to  the  mood  among  companies  and  households  being  much  stronger  than  normal. 
(Figure: Economic Tendency Survey). 
The purchasing managers’ index in Sweden rose to 64.2 on the other hand, which can be 
compared with a figure of 62.4 in the previous month. It was primarily increased orders and 
production that contributed to the rise. (Figure: Purchasing managers’ index). 
Moreover, new statistics show that industrial production has continued to increase strongly, 
and slightly more than market expectations, while the production of services has remained at 
an almost unchanged level. However, industrial production is still far below the earlier peak 
levels. (Figure: Industrial and services production). 
Brighter labour market 
The recovery in the labour market has also continued. Employment began to rise during the 
fourth quarter of last year, and unemployment has begun to fall. The forecast in our Monetary 
Policy Report is that unemployment will fall fairly slowly, and be just over 7.5 per cent in the 
year 2013. (Figure: Labour and employment and unemployment). 
Since  the  report  was  published  the  labour  force  surveys  for  June  have  been  published. 
These  show  that  employment  increased  slightly  more,  and  that  unemployment  was  lower 
during the second quarter of this year, than we had forecast. 
Inflation close to target of 2 per cent 
In our Monetary Policy Report we expect inflation to remain fairly close to the inflation target 
of  2  per  cent  during  the  forecast  period.  This  is  because,  despite  strong  GDP  growth, 
resource  utilisation  will  be  low,  and  this  will  hold  back  domestic  inflationary  pressure. 
Inflationary impulses from abroad will also be weak. But as economic activity recovers and 
resource utilisation rises, inflationary pressures will increase. 
BIS Review 109/2010

Our assessment was therefore that underlying inflation – measured in terms of the CPIF, the 
consumer price index with a fixed interest rate – would fall towards 1 per cent this year, and 
then  rise  towards  2  per  cent  at  the  end  of  2012.  CPI  inflation,  on  the  other  hand,  had 
increased during the spring, and we expected it to continue to increase as a result of rising 
interest rates, until it peaks at almost 3 per cent in 2013. (Figure: Inflation). 
Following the monetary policy meeting at the end of June, new inflation figures have been 
published  for  June  and  July.  These  show  that  the  CPI  and  the  CPIF  rose  by  1.1  and 
1.7 per cent respectively in July, compared with the same month last year. Inflation is so far 
in line with the assessments in the Monetary Policy Report: in July underlying inflation was 
only 0.1 of a percentage point lower than the forecast in our Report. 
Long-term inflation expectations 
It is important to the Riksbank that long-term inflation expectations in society are anchored 
securely around the inflation target of 2 per cent. This makes our work easier. If most people 
expect inflation to be 2 per cent, this affects price-setting and wage-formation, so that we can 
more easily attain the inflation target in the long term (even if short-term fluctuations cause 
inflation to deviate from the target level). This is the reason why we carefully follow inflation 
expectations. 
According to a survey from Prospera, inflation expectations for the coming five-year period 
were on average 2.2 per cent in June. This figure represents an average for all respondents. 
(Figure: Inflation and inflation expectations). 
Recovery in the Swedish economy 
To summarise, the new information presented during the summer supports the Riksbank’s 
view that the Swedish economy is continuing to recover. GDP growth has so far this year 
been  slightly  higher  than  we  had  expected,  and  the  labour  market  has  shown  slightly 
stronger development. Inflation has largely been in line with our forecasts. But this does not 
say very much about the future, of course. And as I mentioned at the beginning, I shall not 
make  any  overall  assessment  of  economic  developments  here  today;  I  shall  wait  until  the 
Executive Board’s next monetary policy meeting at the beginning of September. 
I will now go on to describe how the Riksbank, and I personally, viewed monetary policy at 
the most recent monetary policy meeting at the end of June. 
Swedish monetary policy 
Following  the  financial  crisis,  monetary  policy  in  Sweden  has  been  aimed  mainly  at 
moderating  the  depth  of  the  economic  recession  that  came  in  the  wake  of  the  crisis.  The 
repo rate has been held at an all-time low of 0.25 per cent for a whole year. The Riksbank 
has  also  provided  the  banks  with  more  liquidity  than  normal,  through  a  number  of 
extraordinary measures. However, for some time now the situation has been such that we 
could begin to normalise monetary policy, and now in the final part of my presentation I shall 
describe in more detail our reasoning at the most recent monetary policy meeting. 
Normalisation of the repo rate 
In  July  we  raised  the  repo  rate  from  0.25  to  0.50  per  cent.  I  agreed  with  the  picture  of 
economic developments painted in the most recent Monetary Policy Report and supported 
both the proposal to raise the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points and the repo rate path 
described in the Report. But I also pointed out that we must be prepared to reconsider the 
direction of our monetary policy, if developments abroad turn out to be much weaker than we 
have expected. (Figure: Repo rate). 
6 
 BIS Review 109/2010
Back in April we were expecting to need to raise the repo rate either in July or September. 
We later had to make a substantial upward revision to the forecast for GDP growth this year, 
at the same time as the forecasts for inflation and wages remained largely unchanged. This 
pointed towards raising the repo rate in July rather than waiting until September. 
But,  despite  the  fact  that  the  forecast  for  GDP  growth  in  2010  had  to  be  revised  up 
substantially, we were nevertheless expecting resource utilisation to remain low for most of 
the forecast period, and inflationary pressures to be modest. This pointed towards the repo 
rate needing to be held at a lower rate than normal over the coming period. However, our 
joint assessment was that we ought to ease up on the accelerator and gradually raise the 
repo rate towards a more normal level, as resource utilisation increases. 
I also felt it was reasonable that we in Sweden should begin to raise interest rates sooner 
than the United States and the euro area. This was because we were forecasting a higher 
GDP growth and a slightly higher inflation rate in Sweden, particularly in comparison with the 
euro area, in June. Moreover, our assessment was that fiscal policy in the United States and 
the euro area would probably need to be tightened much more than in Sweden, which meant 
that these areas would need to hold their interest rates lower. 
Another reason for beginning to raise interest rates was to clearly mark that interest rates will 
in the long run be much higher than they are now. Otherwise there is a risk that companies 
and  households  will  base  their  economic  decisions  on  too-low  long-term  interest  rate 
expectations, which can lead to unsustainably-high loans and distorted investment decisions. 
This can in turn entail negative effects on production and employment. 
Unrealistic expectations of interest rates 
The low interest rate we have had over the past year has probably held back expectations of 
interest  rates  in  the  longer  run,  too.  According  to  Prospera’s  surveys,  expectations  of  the 
repo  rate  five  years  ahead  have  fallen  by  around  one  percentage  point  since  we  began 
making large cuts in the repo rate  in autumn 2008. (Figure: Repo rate and expected repo 
rate). 
Market expectations in June were  well below the interest rate path, and the gap was also 
unusually large. This implies that monetary policy was in practice much more expansionary 
than we had intended. (Figure: Monetary policy expectations). 
The National Institute of Economic Research’s surveys of expectations of variable mortgage 
rates  moreover  implied  that  households  were  expecting  relatively  low  interest  rates  in  the 
longer run. In June, households were expecting a variable mortgage rate of 4.3 per cent in 
five years. 
It is important for monetary policy that expectations of the interest rate are in line with the 
repo rate path. This is because it is market expectations of interest rate developments, and 
not  the  Riksbank’s  own  repo  rate  path,  which  determine  the  interest  rates  offered  to 
households  and  companies.  In  addition,  households’  and  companies’  own  expectations  of 
interest rates govern their actions. Thus, expectations of future interest rates are important 
for  the  development  of  the  economy.  At  the  same  time,  the  Riksbank’s  ability  to  steer 
expectations in the longer run is limited in that we only steer the shortest interest rate, the 
repo rate, while the repo rate path is only a forecast. 
During the summer, market expectations of the repo have risen slightly in the short term, but 
fallen  by  more  than  30  basis  points  in  the  longer  run.  Household  expectations  of  variable 
mortgage rates, on the other hand, have risen significantly according to the National Institute 
of Economic Research. They are now largely consistent one and two years ahead with the 
Riksbank’s  repo  rate  path  from  the  most  recent  monetary  policy  meeting.  However, 
households were still expecting a relatively low mortgage rate five years ahead. 
BIS Review 109/2010

Normalisation of monetary policy in general 
The normalisation of monetary policy includes, in addition to interest rate raises, the phasing 
out of the support the Riksbank has given to the banks. When the Riksbank decided to lend 
almost SEK 300 billion at a fixed interest rate last year, it was also decided that the banks 
would pay back the loans on 30 June, 25 August and 6 October this year. In addition, some 
variable-rate loans will mature. 
Despite the phasing out of the fixed-rate loans being known in advance, it could affect money 
market rate, pushing them up until the final loans mature. This is when the interbank market 
will really have to begin functioning as normal. The effective policy rate is also expected to 
return  to  being  in  line  with  the  repo  rate  instead  of  the  fine-tuning  rate,  which  is  10  basis 
points lower than the repo rate. 
When  the  first  fixed-rate  loans  totalling  SEK  100  billion  reached  maturity  on  30  June,  the 
Riksbank’s  total  lending  to  the  banks  declined  by  SEK  91  billion.  At  the  same  time,  other 
loans also matured, while new variable-rate loans with a one-month maturity increased by 
SEK 20 billion. The whole process was carried out without any disruptions to the markets. 
The  outstanding  loans  have  since  declined  further  and  now  amount  to  SEK  222  billion. 
(Figure: the Riksbank’s outstanding loans). 
Summary 
I  have  now  described  the  Riksbank’s  views  and  my  own  personal  views  of  economic 
developments  and  monetary  policy  in  Sweden  as  at  the  most  recent  monetary  policy 
meeting.  The  Swedish  economy  is  currently  developing  strongly,  after  suffering  a  deep 
recession.  Inflationary  pressures  are  low,  but  are  expected  to  rise  as  resource  utilisation 
increases.  Monetary  policy  is  still  aimed  at  supporting  the  recovery  in  the  economy,  but  a 
normalisation has begun. According to the assessment we made in June, the normalisation 
process will continue gradually through interest rate adjustments and the maturity of fixed-
rate loans. 
The new information we have received over the summer largely supports the picture of the 
recovery in the world economy continuing. There are some signs of weakness in the United 
States  and  Asia,  while  Europe  looks  slightly  stronger  than  expected.  The  unease  on  the 
financial markets has waned, but the situation is still not normal. The new information also 
points to a continued recovery in the Swedish economy. 
However, 
the  Riksbank  will  not  make  any  new  overall  assessment  of  economic 
developments until the next monetary policy decision, which will be made on 1 September. 
By then we will have received more information and we will update our forecasts. 
Thank you!
