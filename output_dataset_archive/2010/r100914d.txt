K C Chakrabarty: Banking transactions in the next decade – faster, 
cheaper and easier 
Special  address  by  Dr  K  C  Chakrabarty,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India,  
at  a  panel  session  on  “Transactions  in  the  next  decade:  faster,  cheaper  and  easier”  
at  the  ninth  Federation  of  Indian  Chambers  of  Commerce  and  Industry  (FICCI)  –  
Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) Conference on “Global Banking: Paradigm Shift”, Mumbai, 
8 September 2010. 
 Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,  
1. 
It is a pleasure and privilege to be here today at this ninth Annual Conference on 
“Global  Banking:  Paradigm  shift”  jointly  organised  by  Federation  of  Indian  Chambers  of 
Commerce  and  Industry  (FICCI)  and  Indian  Banks’  Association  (IBA).  The  theme  of  this 
year’s  Conference  is  “Banking  2020:  Making  the  Decade’s  Promise  Come  True”.  Let  me 
begin by asking to whom are we making this promise. We are making this promise to the 
customers, especially the small and retail customers. Let me explain in brief the importance 
and  relevance  of  this  promise.  We  stand  today  at  a  point  of  inflexion  as  far  banking  is 
concerned  both  globally  as  well  as  in  India.  Globally,  the  financial  crisis  has  offered  us  a 
number  of  insights  into  the  ways  in  which  the  existing  banking  system  needs  to  be 
revamped. India, unlike its developed counterparts, has been far less affected by the recent 
turmoil but still has a long way to go in terms of achieving a sustained higher and inclusive 
growth. And for the Indian economy to achieve this goal, banking sector would undoubtedly 
need  to  play  an  extremely  critical  role.  But,  for  that  to  happen,  banks  need  to  optimally 
leverage technology to increase penetration, improve their productivity and efficiency, deliver 
cost-effective  products  and  services,  provide  faster,  efficient  and  convenient  customer 
service, and, thereby, contribute to the overall growth and development of the country. And in 
order  to  make  the  dream  of  growth  coupled  with  inclusion  a  reality,  Indian  banking  sector 
today needs to make a promise, a promise to the customer, especially the small and retail 
customer,  and  to  the  society  at  large,  to  make  banking  transactions  faster,  cheaper  and 
easier  in  the  next  decade.  This  then  brings  me  to  the  topic  of  my  address  today  which  is 
“Banking Transactions in the Next Decade: Faster, Cheaper and Easier.  
2.  
Why banking sector should and can make such a promise now? First of all, because 
we have not been able to fully realise the promise of the last decade. We were constrained 
by our ability as, till a few years ago, appropriate banking technology was not available. But, 
now,  with  the  availability  of  appropriate  banking  technology,  the  time  has  come  when  the 
Indian banking system can make and deliver on that promise.  
3.  
Technology  enables  increased  penetration  of  the  banking  system,  increases  cost 
effectiveness and makes small value transactions viable. Besides making banking products 
and services affordable and accessible; it simultaneously ensures viability and profitability of 
providers.  Increased  penetration  brings  further  reduction  in  costs,  which,  in  turn,  attracts 
more people to avail the services. Technology allows transactions to take place faster and 
offers  unparalleled  convenience  through  various  delivery  channels.  Technology  enhances 
choices,  creates  new  markets,  and  improves  productivity  and  efficiency.  Effective  use  of 
technology has a multiplier effect on growth and development.  
4.  
The question then arises, have we not developed banking technology and delivery 
models  over  the  last  two  decades  since  we  embarked  on  economic  reforms.  The  answer 
undoubtedly is in affirmative. There are a number of achievements that can be highlighted in 
the field of banking technology and banking transactions during the last decade.  
BIS Review 115/2010

 Achievements of the last decade  
5.  
One  of  the  major  objectives  of  banking  sector  reforms  in  India  was  to  promote 
flexibility,  operational  autonomy  and  competition  in  the  system  and  to  raise  the  banking 
standards in India to the international best practices (Reddy, 2002). There has been an all-
round improvement in the health of the banking sector in the post-reform period especially 
during the last decade.  
6.  
The adoption of technology has changed the face of the banking sector which can 
be  seen  from  various  transformational  developments  in  the  recent  past.  Core  Banking 
Solution  enables  banks  to  extend  the  full  benefits  of  ATM,  mobile  banking,  tele-banking, 
internet banking, and card banking, etc. to all customers. It allows banks to offer a multitude 
of services on a 24x7 basis from a single location as well as all possible delivery channels 
existing and proposed. The centralisation thus makes a “one-stop” shop for financial services 
a possibility. Using CBS, customers can access their accounts from any branch, anywhere, 
irrespective of where they have physically opened their accounts.  
7.  
In  the  area  of  payment  and  settlement  system,  where  technology  impacts  the 
customer transactions most, there have been significant advancements. We are one of the 
countries that has effectively tackled huge volumes of paper instruments in a cost effective 
manner. The MICR cheque clearing system processes a staggering 4.5 million cheques on a 
single  day!  The  Cheque  Truncation  System  (CTS)  is  another  innovative  solution  that  has 
been  developed  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  paper  based  clearing  system.  CTS  has 
eliminated  the  need  for  physical  movements  of  cheques.  Speed  clearing  has  been 
introduced by the Reserve Bank to reduce the time taken in clearing up-country cheques and 
take advantage of and leverage the core banking technology adopted by banks.  
8.  
The  advent  of  electronic  payment  modes  has  speeded  up  transaction  processing 
and  settlement.  The  NECS,  with  its  centralised  processing  capability  coupled  with  the 
implementation of Core Banking Solutions (CBS) has brought down the clearing and settlement 
cycle  to  its  current  T+1  basis.  Electronic  Fund  Transfer  (EFT)/National  EFT  (NEFT)  is 
another  illustration,  where  better  process  re-engineering  coupled  with  CBS  and  strict 
adherence to NEFT procedural guidelines has made this product offer fund transfer service 
on a near real time basis to customers. Apart from these retail payment systems, we have 
the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) for large value transactions. Thus what technology 
has done is provided speedier clearing and settlement of transactions, i.e. it has helped us in 
achieving to traverse a portion of the existing path faster.  
9.  
 
Given this background, let me pose a few questions.  
How far has technology enabled us to provide faster transactions to our limited pool 
of customers?  
Has technology driven down costs for banks and customers?  
Have we been successful in using technology to make things easier or convenient 
for the customer?  
Let me admit that much of what I would say is based on anecdotal evidence and 
10.  
there is a paucity of empirical evidence backed by hard data to conclusively answer these 
questions. Detailed research is needed in this area. Also, let us by definition not restrict a 
transaction to just clearing and settlement transaction but a wider term to denote a complete 
transaction from a customer’s perspective. This would typically include not only the time to 
complete the transaction but also the dispute resolution in case of failure. Then let us try to 
answer if technology has enabled faster transactions. The answer would be a “yes” as far as 
bigger customers are concerned. But, what about small and retail customers especially when 
there is a problem? If we take the average time of the successful, semi-successful and failed 
transactions,  I  am  afraid  that  the  answer  to  this  question  may  well  be  “no”.  To  illustrate,  I 
would recall complaints related to ATM transactions when account is debited and cash is not 
 2 
 BIS Review 115/2010
dispensed. As you  would be aware, charged with numerous complaints by customers and 
the  inordinate  delays  faced  by  them  for  the  banks  to  re-credit  their  accounts,  the  Reserve 
Bank  has  now  imposed  a  mandatory  timeframe  of  12  days  within  which  the  customer’s 
account has to be credited, failing which a penalty of Rs.100 per day is payable by the bank 
to  the  customer.  In  a  CBS  environment,  why  should  reconciliation  take  such  a  long  time 
leading to customer inconvenience and regulatory intervention on behalf of the customer?  
11.  
I  will  illustrate  with  another  example.  Technology  has  provided  us  the  comfort  of 
internet banking from our desk tops. As a prudent security measure, the customer is logged 
out of his account after entering his password incorrectly three times. He then either goes to 
the branch or contacts the toll-free number for issue of a new password. But why does it take 
ten  days  to  issue  a  new  password  to  the  customer  and  a  further  additional  two  days  to 
activate the password after the customer duly authenticates and acknowledges receipt of the 
password? Is it not necessary that the whole process is speeded up substantially to enable 
the customer to start operating his internet banking facility at the earliest?  
12.  
Has  technology  driven  down  costs  for  banks  and  customers?  In  order  to  provide 
various  services  banks  have  had  to  incur  capital  costs  for  various  technology  solutions. 
These include the implementation of the Core Banking Solution, putting up ATMs, providing 
connectivity  between  branches,  etc.  But  with  the  implementation  of  state-of-the-art 
technological  solutions,  have  the  operating  costs  of  banks  come  down?  Logically,  they 
should have over a period of time and then the banks should start deriving a return on the 
asset. Has this come about?  
13.  
The  Net  Interest  Margin  of  banks  has  not  reduced  much;  especially  when  the 
structure  of  business  has  not  changed.  The  Net  Interest  Margin  (NIM),  which  reflects  the 
difference between the interest earned and interest expended (as per cent of total assets), 
which stood at 3.37 per cent in 1992 declined to 2.95 per cent in 2000 and was slightly lower 
at 2.63 per cent in 2009 (Table 1). The ratio of urban and metro to total business has been 
increasing  signifying  that  the  structure  of  the  business  has  remained  same.  During  the 
period, the operating costs to total assets has come down gradually but not as drastically as 
one would have expected due to the introduction of technology. The intermediation costs of 
banks in India still tend to be higher than those in developed banking markets.

 Yet, the question remains how far has the customer benefited from this increase in 
14.  
income of banks. I would like to say that very little of the benefits earned by banks in today’s 
liberalised environment have been passed on to the customers. There is enough empirical 
evidence to show that the cost of small transactions has not gone down. I will give only one 
example  of  low  value  draft  issuance  charges.  Unless  low-value  transactions  are  cost-
effectively done, it is not going to impact efficiency drastically.  
15.  
As  regards  actual  measurement  of  transaction  costs,  there  are  almost  no  studies 
which actually quantify in a systematic way the exact level of costs in financial transactions 
from a customer’s point of view. Incidentally, I would like the IBA to look into this issue and 
initiate  studies  on  a  regular  basis  for  understanding  the  cost  of  transactions  for  small  and 
retail customers.  
Have we been successful in using technology to make things easier or convenient 
16.  
for the customer? No doubt, technology has the potential to extend in a cost effective manner 
the  penetrative  reach  of  banking  services  and  products  to  a  large  section  of  the  excluded 
society.  But  let  us  look  at  some  of  the  critical  indicators  for  access  to  finance  and 
performance  and  efficiency  of  banks  in  India along  with  benchmark  indicators  for  selected 
high-income  OECD  member  countries  that  are  given  in  annex  table  1.  The  penetration 
indicators reveal that there have been improvements during 200108 but is still very adverse 
as compared to OECD economies.  
17.  
Is  it  any  easier  to  open  a  deposit  account?  Can  a  person  get  a  loan  easily  and 
quickly? I have numerous anecdotal evidences including the one by my domestic help who in 
a  metropolis  like  Mumbai,  spent  two  days  of  her  labour  time  running  around  completing 
formalities to open a basic savings account with a renowned bank.  
18.  
We all talk about single window operation in banks but has it really happened? Here, 
I would again to like to bring in my favourite example of the Indian Railways, a public sector 
organisation,  which  has  managed  to  provide  its  customers  with  a  single  window  service 
facility related to all transactions such as ticketing, cancellation, enquiry, etc. for  any train, 
destination or class. Let us introspect and answer, have we as bankers come any closer to 
that?  
I  shall  also  draw  your  attention  towards  another  aspect  of  customer  convenience 
19.  
evidenced  in  the  number  of  rising  complaints.  Data  from  the  Banking  Ombudsman  offices 
show  that  number  of  complaints  excluding  credit  card  related  complaints  per  1  million 
accounts rose from 75 complaints in 200607 to 245 complaints in 200809. What is even 
more  noteworthy  is  that  if  public  sector  banks  had  about  165  complaints  per  1  million 
accounts  in  200809,  the  corresponding  figures  for  private  sector  banks  was  more  than 
double  at  377  (406  for  new  generation  private  sector  banks)  and  851  for  foreign  banks  in 
200809.  Moreover,  we  have  all  the  reason  to  believe  that  many  of  these  complaints  are 
received  at  urban  and  metropolitan  centres,  where  the  common  persons  are  much  more 
aware  of  such  mechanisms  of  expressing  their  grievances.  It  is  needless  to  stress  that  to 
make  banking  transactions  more  convenient  for  the  customer,  a  quick  and  effective 
grievance redressal system is essential.  
20.  
Thus,  it  can  be  summarized  that  the  opportunities  presented  by  adoption  of 
technology  could  not  be  fully  exploited  and  the  customer  still  has  not  been  able  to  enjoy 
faster, cheaper, and easier banking services. The obvious question then to ask is why this 
has not happened. I will draw upon my address last week at the Economic Times Banking 
Technology Conclave 2010 where I have identified the following reasons:  
a)  
4 
 Absence of a strategic vision and action plan  
For a plan to succeed there must be a vision and strategy driving implementation. 
There is clearly an absence of vision of how technology is going to drive business 
and customer relationship. Thus technology adoption in banks is a result of external 
BIS Review 115/2010
b)  
c)  
d)  
e)  
pressures rather than a vision shared by the bank staff percolating right down from 
right  up  or  a  corporate  vision  of  the  positive  externalities  that  will  result. 
Consequently,  this  lack  of  long-term  vision  and  strategy  has  impacted  the  way 
technology has been utilised.  
Technology focus was not customer-centric  
Technology  must  be  implemented  with  the  customer  in  focus.  Technology  must 
enable  customer  facilitation  in  terms  of  cost,  time  and  convenience.  It  should  be 
dovetailed  to  customer  needs  and  expectations.  In  sharp  contrast,  technology 
implementation  in  our  public  sector  banks  appears  to  be  more  for  regulatory  and 
policy compliance. This has oriented the banking technology to be more employee-
friendly rather than customer-friendly.  
Business process re-engineering was not done  
Business process re-engineering integral to leverage manpower for business growth 
and  increased  profitability,  and  cetirus  paribus  to  derive  optimum  benefits  of 
technology  up  gradation,  has  not  happened  at  the  desired  pace.  Globally,  post 
technology adoption, only 10 per cent of the banking staff is involved in “back office” 
jobs  and  the  remaining  90  per  cent  of  the  banking  staff  are  freed  for  performing 
“front  office”  jobs  of  customer  acquisition,  servicing  and  retention  by  ensuring 
customer  loyalty.  The  net  result  was  tinkering  with  parts  rather  than  the  needed 
systemic overhaul that could have been achieved had the banks adopted a planned 
transformational management system.  
Absence of simple cost effective delivery model  
We  are  yet  to  put  in  place  a  cost-effective,  decentralised  and  realistic  delivery 
model.  Fledgling  delivery  models  are  being  tried  out  experimentally.  Fixing  a 
problem  /  glitch  when  it  happens  is  the  weakest  link.  This  issue  is  even  more 
important considering that increasingly larger number of hitherto un-banked people 
will  interface  with  the  banks  through  hand-held/  mobile  front-end  devices.  The 
credibility of the entire system will be at stake and take a hit if the problems are not 
promptly resolved as they arise and real time solutions are not proffered.  
Information and technology was segregated  
There was no business and IT plan to leverage technology for increasing business 
and profits. IT should help banks not just to deliver robust and reliable services to 
their  customers  at  a  lower  cost,  but  also  generate  and  manage  information 
effectively.  Information  comprises  data  collected  based  on  principles  of  integrity, 
reliability,  and  accuracy.  Banks  are  collecting  humungous  quantities  and 
warehousing  volumes  of  data  relating  to  customers  and  transactions.  The 
information  is  not  subjected  to  meaningful  analysis,  usage  and  creation  of  a 
database with an objective to meet not only the diversified internal and external MIS 
requirements  but  also  using  this  information  to  increase  the  volume  of  profitable 
business using unique techniques of Customer Relationship Management (CRM). It 
would  not  be  wrong  to  say  that  “Information”  from  “Information  Technology”  is 
missing.  
BIS Review 115/2010

 f)  
Non-availability of infrastructure  
Banking  penetration  through  ICT  models  or  otherwise  requires  some  basic 
infrastructure  to  be  in  place.  There  needs  to  be  robust  digital  and  physical 
infrastructure for banking services to reach un-banked and inaccessible areas.  
g)  
Lack of collaborative efforts  
Since, the challenge is huge, a planned, strategic and massive concerted effort is 
needed from all stakeholders which was not well appreciated earlier. It is now well 
recognized  that  taking  banking  to  the  masses  and  providing  cheaper,  easier  and 
faster service requires a greater collaborative effort which was lacking earlier.  
So  what  then  is  the  way  ahead  and  what  should  we  do?  I  have  five  major 
19.  
observations to make about the way we need to envisage banking or financial technology in 
the  years  to  come.  This  naturally  draws  upon  the  reasons that  I  have  just  narrated  above 
which in my opinion have hampered the full benefits of technology being leveraged by banks 
for fuelling growth and development.  
a)  
An integrated IT plan and Business Plan and an integrated IT and Business strategy 
is a must. A long-term vision and strategy on how technology can be harnessed to 
deliver on business goals needs to be framed and percolated down the organisation.  
Appropriate technology and efficient Delivery Model: All our efforts would not bear 
fruit if technology issues are not addressed first. Till today, not all commercial bank 
and regional rural bank branches are under CBS. Scalable financial inclusion cannot 
happen  without  stable  and  reliable  Information  and  Communications  Technology 
(ICT)  based  models.  The  transactions  through  the  hand  held  front  end-devices 
should  be  seamlessly  integrated  with  banks’  back-end  servers.  In  our  interaction 
with  the  banks,  we  are  stressing  that  the  technology  aspects  deserves  our 
immediate  attention.  We  need  to  closely  analyse  whether  any  technology/vendor/ 
systems shortcomings is hindering the optimal beneficial utilisation of CBS both for 
centralisation  of  the  back-end  processes  and  information  processing  capabilities. 
Banks must refine their Delivery Models for greater effectiveness and efficiency. BC 
based delivery model has been made more flexible and inclusive.  
Technology has  to  be  customer-centric  in  every  sense  of  the  term.  It  has  to  be  a 
technology driven towards drawing in the entire mass of small and retail customers 
into the banking system. As we know that globally 90 per cent of the banking staff is 
involved  in  “front  office”  jobs  of  enhancing  customer  base  and  ensuring  customer 
loyalty. In India, however, the situation is exactly the reverse.  
Proper  IT  Governance  structure:  Technology  should  not  only  reduce  cost  of 
transactions  and  improve  the  delivery  model  but  also  help  banks  generate  and 
manage information effectively. In order to strengthen the delivery channel, banks 
need a comprehensive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution which 
would enable them to access the entire customer details and provide a unified view 
across channels and products to enhance service quality. For CRM to function well, 
we need to develop IT governance structure, which can provide effective control on 
the  existing  IT  infrastructure  created  by  banks.  This  would  ultimately  result  in 
enabling  better  alignment  between  IT  and  Business,  create  efficiencies,  enhance 
conformity  to  internationally  accepted  best  practices  and  improve  overall  IT 
performance of banks. An important aspect of IT governance is the need to address 
enhanced  security  concerns  associated  with  technology.  We  need  to  ensure  that 
information and technology are integrated.  
Collaborative efforts by all stakeholders: It is essential to create shared interests and 
proactive involvement of all the players. Even after all these efforts, banks alone will 
not  be  able  to  do  it  if  all  stakeholders  like  Governments,  both  Central  and  State,

 BIS Review 115/2010
Regulators,  NGOs,  Technology  Vendors,  Industry  Associations,  Insurance  and 
Mutual  Fund  Companies,  and  society  at  large  are  not  involved.  Big  technology 
players have to come forward to facilitate this process and develop hardware and 
software appropriate to our country.  
Conclusion 
20.  
In conclusion, I would like to say that the progress made by banks during the last 
decade  is  commendable.  The  health  of  the  banking  system  is  strong,  they  have  adopted 
technology,  and  are  making  efforts  at  increasing  penetration.  However,  the  benefit  of 
technology has not percolated to common people. As a result, banking transactions have not 
become cheaper, easier and faster due to deficiency in delivery model, absence of BPR, as 
also lack of infrastructure. What is needed at this stage is a planned, strategic and massive 
collaborative effort from all stakeholders to leverage technology in an effective way, bringing 
more people into banking fold, reducing costs and, thereby, ensuring benefits of technology 
indeed results in cheaper, easier and faster transactions, particularly for our small and retail 
customers.  I  hope  the  deliberations of  this  conference  will  identify  the  issues,  work  out  an 
action plan and implement them so that the banking system can truly deliver on its promise 
for the year 2020. This will go a long way in ensuring a sustainable and inclusive growth in 
the society.  
Thank you for inviting me here to share my thoughts with you all.
