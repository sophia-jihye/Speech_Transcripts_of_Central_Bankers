Andrew G Haldane: Capital discipline 
Remarks by Mr Andrew G Haldane, Executive Director of the Bank of England, based on a 
speech given at the American Economic Association, Denver, Colorado, 9 January 2011. 
 The views are not necessarily those of the Bank of England or the interim Financial Policy Committee. I would like 
to  thank  Tamiko  Bayliss,  Paul  Bedford,  Samuel  Knott,  Priya  Kothari,  Salina  Ladha,  Vasileios  Madouros,  Clare 
Rogowski, Victoria Saporta, Rhiannon Sowerbutts, Marco Spaltro, George Speight, Belinda Tracey, Paul Tucker, 
Matthew Willison and Peter Zimmerman for comments and contributions. 
The  Basel  Committee  sets  capital  standards  for  international  banks.  There  are  now  three 
vintages of these standards: so-called Basel I dating from 1988, Basel II dating from around 
2004  and  Basel  III  which  was  agreed  at  the  end  of  last  year.1  These  international  capital 
standards are supported by three pillars. Pillar I defines the regulatory rules, Pillar II provides 
scope  for  supervisory  discretion,  while  Pillar  III  seeks  to  foster  market  discipline  through 
disclosure. In countering systemic shocks, three supporting pillars have understandably been 
felt to be better than one. 
But the success of international capital standards in forestalling banking distress has been 
mixed. Basel I regulatory rules were arbitraged due to their risk insensitivity. This gave rise to 
Basel II with its greater focus on risk calibration. But Basel II buckled under the weight of the 
recent  crisis.  Repairs  have  since  been  applied  through  Basel  III.  Historical  experience 
suggests this is unlikely to be the end of road.  
This  paper  assesses  and  suggests  means  of  improving  the  robustness  of  this  regulatory 
framework.  The  quest  for  risk  sensitivity  in  Pillar  I  rules  caused  regulatory  complexity  and 
opacity to blossom. This may have inhibited the effectiveness of supervisory discretion and 
market discipline (Section 1). In consequence, Pillar I may have borne too much of the load 
and Pillars II and III too little. Here I focus on Pillar III.   
There  may  be  straightforward  ways  to  rebalance  the  Basel  scales,  re-injecting  market 
discipline. Having banks issue a graduated set of contingent convertible (“CoCo”) securities, 
which  are  responsive  to  early  signs  of  market  stress,  is  one  possible  way  of  doing  so 
(Sections 2 and 3). That would have the practical effect of reinforcing Pillar I with Pillar III, so 
delivering a potentially more balanced and robust regulatory edifice.  
Getting  from  here  to  there  may  take  time.  But  some  modest  adjustment  to  dividend  and 
bonus distribution policies by banks would help (Section 4). Section 5 concludes. 
The first pillar 
The  recently-agreed  Basel  III  package  delivers  a  material  strengthening  of  regulatory 
standards. Though the details are complex, the essence of these reforms is easily described: 
“more of the same – and better”. So there will be more bank capital and in future it will be 
higher  quality.  Banks  will  be  required,  for  the  first  time  in  an  international  accord,  to  hold 
liquid assets, and in future will be more resilient. Risk management will be more extensive 
and in future it will be more robust. And bank supervisors will be more plentiful and in future 
they will be smarter. 
That has been the response to virtually every financial crisis of the past fifty years. It has not 
arrested the crisis cycle – if anything, the incidence of crises appears to have risen.2 It may

not even have slowed this cycle, as the massive costs of this time’s crisis attest. So although 
the recent Basel III package may be necessary, there must be a real question about whether 
it  will  be  sufficient  to  cope  with  next  time’s  crisis.  History,  at  least,  provides  grounds  for 
pessimism.  
As a thought experiment, imagine instead we were designing a regulatory framework from 
scratch. Finance is a classic complex, adaptive system. What properties would a complex, 
adaptive system such as finance ideally exhibit to best insure about future crises? Simplicity 
is  one.  There  is  a  key  lesson,  here,  from  the  literature  on  complex  systems.  Faced  with 
complexity,  the  temptation  is  to  seek  complex  control  devices.  In  fact,  complex  systems 
typically call for simple control rules. To do otherwise simply compounds system complexity 
with control complexity.3 Uncertainty would not then divide, it would multiply. 
Robustness  would  be  a  second.  This  has  a  particular  meaning  in  the  context  of  complex 
systems:  resilience  given  ignorance.4  More  often,  this  is  called  Knightian  uncertainty  or 
simply  model  error.  The  dynamics  of  complex  systems,  such  as  large  banks  or 
interconnected financial webs, are not well understood. That means uncertainty needs to be 
taken seriously if financial regulatory frameworks are to be robust.  
Timeliness would be a third criterion. Complex systems often exhibit a knife-edge property, 
with  discontinuities  and  tipping  points  a  naturally-recurring  feature.5  Those  same  features 
have punctuated the present financial crisis. In physics as in finance, once over the cliff-edge 
there is little chance of full recovery. That underscores the importance of timely, pre-emptive 
regulatory intervention if financial disaster is to be averted.  
Simplicity 
(a)  
How  do  existing  regulatory  rules  compare  against  these  criteria  –  simplicity,  timeliness, 
robustness? Take simplicity. By any standard, existing regulatory rules are far from simple. 
For large banks, they can be highly complex. They have become more so over time given 
the evolution of the Basel framework. 
Back in the days of Basel I, calculating a regulatory capital ratio was not especially taxing or 
time-consuming.  It  involved  little  more  than  half  a  dozen  calculations.  These  calculations 
could  be  conducted  on  the  back  of  a  small  envelope  by  a  competent  clerk.  Possessing 
envelopes and clerks, banks, regulators and market participants were able to perform those 
calculations.  They  were  transparent  and  verifiable.  In  that  way,  regulatory  rules  (Pillar  I) 
provided  a  solid  platform  for  supervisory  discretion  by  regulators  (Pillar  II)  and  market 
discipline by investors (Pillar III). The Basel pillars were mutually reinforcing. 
Basel  II  changed  that  calculus.  In  part  to  avert  regulatory  arbitrage,  there  was  a  quest  for 
greater  risk-sensitivity.  Regulatory  capital  rules  became  more  finely  calibrated  to  banks’ 
underlying  portfolio  of  risks.  In  practice,  that  meant  two  things.  First,  the  number  of 
independent  categories  of  risk  assets  increased.  And  second,  greater  use  was  made  of 
banks’  own internal  models  to  generate  the  risk  metrics  associated  with  each  asset  class. 
The consequences of this regulatory shift for system complexity have been extraordinary.  
For  large  and  complex  banks,  the  number  of  risk  categories  has  exploded.  To  illustrate, 
consider  the  position  of  a  large,  representative  bank  using  an  advanced  internal  set  of 
models  to  calibrate  capital.  Its  number  of  risk  buckets  has  increased  from  around  seven 
under Basel I to, on a conservative estimate, over 200,000 under Basel II. To determine the

regulatory capital ratio of this bank, the number of calculations has risen from single figures 
to over 200 million. The quant and the computer have displaced the clerk and the envelope. 
At one level, this is technical progress; it is the appliance of science to risk management. But 
there are costs. Given such complexity, it has become increasingly difficult for regulators and 
market participants to vouch for the accuracy of reported capital ratios. They are no longer 
easily verifiable or transparent. They are as much an article of faith as fact, as much art as 
science.  This  weakens  both  Pillars  II  and  III.  For  what  the  market  cannot  observe,  it  is 
unlikely  to  be  able  to  exercise  discipline  over.  And  what  the  regulator  cannot  verify,  it  is 
unlikely to be able to exercise supervision over. Banks themselves have recently begun to 
voice just such concerns.  
Robustness 
(b)  
A further cost to complexity arises from model error. Model uncertainty, as distinct from risk, 
is rarely taken into account when interpreting reported capital ratios. But without some idea 
of  uncertainty,  it  is  difficult  to  know  how  much  confidence  to  place  in  reported  solvency 
measures.  How  large  are  the  confidence  intervals  investors  and  regulators  ought  to  place 
around them?  
Calibrating  confidence  intervals  around  capital  would  involve  aggregating  across  myriad 
assets and multiple models. Rather tellingly, that is too complex a calculation for anyone to 
have  carried  out.  But  by  drawing  on  banks’  own  published  model  output,  it  is  possible  to 
gauge  uncertainty  around  some  of  the  key  balance  sheet  components  –  for  example,  the 
retail credit portfolio, the wholesale credit portfolio and the trading book.  
For the retail credit portfolio, consider a simple, single source of model error – calculating the 
probability  of  default  (PD)  for  different  classes  or  borrower.  Under  the  advanced  model-
based approach to calculating retail PDs, each loan is placed in a risk bucket. So there is a 
degree of intrinsic uncertainty both about where in the risk bucket the true PD lies and indeed 
about whether it lies in the assigned risk bucket at all. 
To gauge the importance of these uncertainties, the mortgage portfolios of two large banks 
were examined and capital calibrated using their reported models. These capital ratios were 
then  simulated  under  two  counterfactual  assumptions:  (a)  that  true  PDs  were  uniformly 
distributed within the risk bucket; (b) that true PDs were higher than recorded PDs by one 
risk bucket.  
The results are illustrated in Charts 1 and 2. Chart 1 looks at the distribution of the reported 
capital ratio, indexed to 100, assuming model uncertainty only exists within each risk bucket 
and is symmetric. Even under this assumption the confidence intervals are significant, with 
the “true” capital ratio lying anywhere between 15% above or below the reported ratio. Once 
we  allow  for  the  possibility  of  PDs  being  systematically  under-estimated,  the  degree  of 
uncertainty is greater still. The “true” ratio then lies up to 35% below the reported ratio. That 
equates to several percentage points of capital. 
A different way of gauging the effects of model uncertainty is to look at how different banks 
value  essentially  identical  exposures.  For  UK  banks’  wholesale  credit  portfolio,  the  FSA 
conducted just such an exercise in 2009.6 A hypothetical portfolio was constructed based on 
64 externally rated corporate, bank and sovereign exposures. Banks were then asked to use 
their  models  to  generate  PDs  and  capital  for  this  hypothetical  portfolio,  which  could  be 
compared across banks. 
The range of reported capital requirements held against this common portfolio was striking. 
For wholesale exposures to banks, capital requirements differed by a factor of over 100%.

For  corporate  exposures,  they  differed  by  a  factor  of  around  150%.  And  for  sovereign 
exposures,  they  differed  by  a  factor  of  up  to  280%.  Those  differences  could  equate  to  a 
confidence interval around reported capital ratios of 2 percentage points or more. 
A final means of gauging potential model error is to consider past evidence. During the crisis, 
model error was largest and most egregious in the trading book. Charts 3 and 4 compare UK 
banks’ pre-crisis capital held against the trading book to trading book losses during the crisis. 
Losses were up to six times greater than pre-crisis trading book capital (Chart 3). And capital 
ratios  would  have  needed  to  be  up  to  2.5  percentage  points  higher  to  accommodate  this 
model risk (Chart 4). A fundamental review of the trading book is underway to address this 
problem.  
This  evidence  only  provides  a  glimpse  at  the  potential  model  error  problem  viewed  from 
three  different  angles.  Yet  it  suggests  that  model  error-based  confidence  intervals  around 
reported  capital  ratios  might  run  to  several  percentage  points.  For  a  bank,  that  is  the 
difference  between  life  and  death.  The  shift  to  advanced  models  for  calibrating  economic 
capital has not arrested this trend. More likely, it has intensified it. The quest for precision 
may have come at the expense of robustness. 
Hayek titled his 1974 Nobel address “The Pretence of Knowledge”.7 In it, he highlighted the 
pitfalls of seeking precisely measurable answers to questions about the dynamics of complex 
systems.  Subsequent  research  on  complex  systems  has  confirmed  Hayek’s  hunch.  Policy 
predicated  on  over-precision  risks  catastrophic  error.  Complexity  in  risk  models  may  have 
perpetuated Hayek’s pretence in the minds of risk managers and regulators.  
Timeliness 
(c)  
One of the purported benefits of model-based calibration is that it increases the sensitivity of 
capital  requirements  to  changes  in  risk.  Reported  regulatory  capital  ratios  should  better 
reflect  risk  and  thus  should  in  principle  offer  timely  advance  warnings  of  impending  bank 
stress.  
The data tell a somewhat different story. To see that, consider the experience of a panel of 
33  large  international  banks  during  the  crisis.  This  panel  conveniently  partitions  itself  into 
banks subject to government intervention in the form of capital or guarantees (“crisis banks”) 
and those free from such intervention (“no crisis banks”).  
Chart 5 plots the reported Tier 1 capital ratio of these two sets of banks in the run-up to the 
Lehman Brothers crisis in September 2008. Two observations are striking. First, the reported 
capital  ratios  of  the  two  sets  of  banks  are  largely  indistinguishable.  If  anything,  the  crisis 
banks  looked  slightly  stronger  pre-crisis  on  regulatory  solvency  measures.  Second, 
regulatory  capital  ratios  offer,  on  average,  little  if  any  advance  warning  of  impending 
problems.  These  conclusions  are  essentially  unchanged  using  the  Basel  III  definitions  of 
capital. 
This visual evidence can be formalised by constructing some Type I (false positive) and Type 
II (missed crisis) error estimates for the same 33-bank panel. Assume, by way of illustration 
only,  that  if  a  bank’s  Tier  1  capital  ratio  dips  below  8%,  this  is  deemed  to  signal  distress 
(Table 1). The probability of a Type I error using regulatory capital ratios is 50%, while the 
probability of a Type II error is around 43%. On those assumptions, this suggests regulatory 
capital  ratios  do  about  as  well  in  predicting  crises  as  a  coin  toss.  They  are  essentially 
uninformative about future bank stress. 
Taken together, this does not paint an altogether encouraging picture. A critic might argue 
that regulatory capital ratios have become too complex to verify, too error-prone to be reliably

robust  and  too  leaden-footed  to  enable  prompt  corrective  action.  From  a  first  principles 
perspective, they score poorly as an optimal control device over a complex system such as 
finance. 
 Resurrecting the third pillar 
What  could  be  done  to  strengthen  the  framework?  As  a  thought  experiment,  consider 
dropping  risk  models  and  instead  relying  on  the  market.  Market-based  metrics  of  bank 
solvency could be based around the market rather than book value of capital. The market 
prices  of  banks  are  known  to  offer  useful  supplementary  information  to  that  collected  by 
supervisors when assessing bank health.8 And there is also evidence they can offer reliable 
advance warnings of bank distress.9 
To  bring  these  thoughts  to  life,  consider  three  possible  alternative  bank  solvency  ratios 
based on market rather than accounting measures of capital: 
 
Market-based  capital  ratio:  the  ratio  of  a  bank’s  market  capitalisation  to  its  total 
assets. 
Market-based leverage ratio: the ratio of a bank’s market capitalisation to its total 
debt. 
Tobin’s Q: the ratio of the market value of a bank’s equity to its book value. 
 
The first two are essentially market-based variants of regulatory capital measures, the third a 
well-known  corporate  valuation  metric.10  How  do  they  fare  against  the  first  principles  of 
complex, adaptive systems? 
They  clearly  offer  the  advantage  of  simplicity  and  transparency.  200  million  separate 
calculations would condense to a simple, single sum. The clerk would make a glorious return 
and displace the quant. Market-based measures could be observed and verified in real-time 
by  regulators  and  market  participants.  That  could  help  in  enhancing  both  supervisory 
discretion and market discipline. Market-based capital ratios could support all three Pillars, 
helping to rebalance the Basel scales.  
Market-based  solvency  metrics  offer  two  further  advantages.  First,  they  are  not  reliant  on 
myriad, mis-specified models. They are largely model-free, if not error-free.11 They are robust 
to model error and ignorance. Second, history suggests that, at least in the latest crisis, they 
would have given far timelier signals of impending stress, and so a better guide to prompt 
corrective action, ahead of the crisis cliff-edge being reached.  
To illustrate that, Charts 6–8 look at the three market-based measures of solvency for the 
33-bank panel, again broken down between “crisis” and “no crisis” banks. There is now clear 
blue water between the solvency ratios of the crisis and non-crisis banks, with the second 
materially weaker. In the two years prior to the Lehman Brothers crisis, the average market-
based capital ratio was around 5 percentage points lower for crisis than for no crisis banks.  
Second,  market-based  measures  of  capital  offered  clear  advance  signals  of  impending 
distress.  For  example,  the  market-based  capital  ratio  of  crisis  banks  began  to  fall  in  April 
2007,  well  over  a  year  ahead  of  the  Lehmans  crisis.  To  formalise  that  visual  impression, 
Table 1 shows Type I and II errors for the three market-based capital measures. These now

9   Berger et al (2000). 
10   Calomiris and Herring (2011) prefer a variant of the first measure. 
11   Largely,  because  even  marked-based  measures  of  solvency  will  rely  on  disclosures  by  banks,  which  will 
themselves be model-dependent to some degree.

comfortably outperform a coin toss. Replacing the book value of capital with its market value 
lowers  errors  by  a  half,  often  much  more.  Market  measures  provide  both  fewer  false 
positives and more reliable advance warnings of future banking distress.  
Taken  together,  then,  market-based  solvency  metrics  perform  creditably  against  first 
principles: they appear to offer the potential for simple, timely and robust control of a complex 
financial web.  
Triggers are based on market-based measures of solvency, as in Charts 6–8.  
These triggers are graduated, stretching up banks’ capital structure.13  
On triggering, these claims convert from debt into equity. 
Contractual prompt corrective action 
But  how  should  these  market-based  metrics  be  put  to  use  in  the  design  of  a  regulatory 
framework? Market warnings are useless unless they are acted on, either by the market itself 
or by regulators. It is not too difficult to devise a reconfiguration of banks’ capital structure 
that would bake-in the benefits of simplicity, robustness and timeliness. This would involve a 
cocktail of revised regulatory capital standards fortified by market discipline. It might work as 
follows. 
Alongside  equity,  banks  would  be  required  to  issue  a  set  of  contingent  convertible 
instruments  –  so-called  “CoCos”.  These  instruments  have  attracted  quite  a  bit  of  attention 
recently  among  academics,  policymakers  and  bankers,  though  there  remains  uncertainty 
about  their  design.12  In  particular,  consider  CoCos  with  the  following  possible  design 
characteristics.  
 
 
 
Although  novel  in  some  respects,  CoCos  with  these  characteristics  would  be  simple  to 
understand. They would be easy to monitor in real time by regulators and investors. And they 
would alter potentially quite radically incentives, and thus market dynamics, ahead of banking 
stress becoming too acute. 
To see why, imagine a bank whose expected future profits, and hence market capitalisation, 
have  slumped.  If  this  erosion  of  profits  is  sufficiently  material,  conversion  at  the  highest 
trigger  occurs.  Upon  triggering,  a  chunk  of  that  bank’s  debt  converts  into  equity, 
automatically recapitalising the bank and providing it with an extra equity cushion. This equity 
infusion ought to help restore market confidence in the bank’s soundness. 
If the first conversion does not do the trick, or if the profits shock is sufficiently large, there 
are  other  rungs  in  the  ladder.  Lower  triggers  provide  a  graduated  safety  net.  As  these 
triggers are pulled, converting CoCos offer progressively greater stuffing for the cushion. This 
is a double boon. It confers the benefits of (contractually pre-agreed contingent) equity. But 
knowledge of the graduated safety net ought also to help stabilise investors’ confidence in 
the bank. 
Under this capital structure, banks’ insurance contract would be fundamentally different than 
at  present.  Instead  of  equity  being  provided  at  haste  under  stress,  the  safety  net  would 
extend  automatically  in  advance.  And  instead  of  being  provided  by  the  state  ex  post, 
insurance  would  come  from  private  creditors  ex  ante.  Timely  self-insurance  would  replace 
laggardly public insurance. There would be prompt corrective action. But it would operate on 
autopilot, using a contractual, market-based navigation system.  
                                                 
12   For example, Flannery (2010), Flannery and Perotti (2011), Duffie (2011), Calomiris and Herring (2011).  
13   Alternatively,  there  could  be  graduated  tranches  of  CoCos  operating  with  a  single  trigger.  The  economic 
impact of these two structures would be very similar.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
This contractual automaticity would provide a shot in the arm to incentives and thus market 
discipline. First, for the incentives of investors. Knowing that a trigger might be close to being 
pulled,  and  their  claims  converted,  CoCo  investors  are  likely  to  sit  up  and  take  notice.  If 
conversion  takes  place  below  the  prevailing  market  price,  the  incentives  among  existing 
shareholders  are  similarly  sensitised.  Early  signs  of  deteriorating  profits  or  sentiment  are 
likely  to  result  in  greater  investor  activism.  Such  activism  was  absent  in  the  run-up  to  the 
crisis, in part because there was no early morning wake-up call for investors.  
Second, for the incentives of management. If investors are grumpy about their early morning 
wake-up  call,  management  of  the  bank  are  likely  to  hear  their  hoarse  protests.  And 
anticipating these protests, management are less likely to sail close to the wind or at least 
will  be  quicker  to  tack  when  fearing  a  squall.  Management,  too,  would  be  provided  with 
incentives to remain shipshape.  
Third,  for  the  incentives  of  regulators.  In  the  depths  of  crisis,  as  recent  experience  has 
shown, the temptation to forbear or bail-out is very strong. It is no surprise that the authorities 
often opt for the greater certainty of bail-out ex post, whatever their preferences ex ante. This 
policy time-consistency problem lies at the heart of the current regulatory debate.  
Better  resolution  tools,  which  would  be  needed  if  CoCos  are  not  enough,  can  lessen  the 
dilemma and are an essential part of the reform programme. They give the authorities extra 
options  such  as  creditor  bail-in  through  write-downs  or  debt-for-equity  conversions.  They 
provide a statutory backstop, enabling bail-in of private sector creditors. As such, they are a 
necessary ingredient for restoring market discipline.  
CoCos  buttress  market  discipline  and  help  lift  the  authorities  from  the  horns  of  the  time-
consistency  dilemma.  They  augment  regulatory  discretion  at  the  point  of  distress  with 
contractual rules well ahead of distress. Capital replenishment is contractual and automatic; 
it  is  written  and  priced  ex-ante  and  delivered  without  temptation  ex-post.  Because 
intervention would be prompt, transparent and rule-based, the scope for regulatory discretion 
would be constrained. For that reason, the time-consistency problem ought to be reduced, 
perhaps materially. A contractual belt is added to the resolution braces.  
To  achieve  these  benefits,  change  would  be  needed  to  banks’  capital  structure.  But  this 
reconfiguration  would  not  be  especially  dramatic.  Indeed,  it  would  be  as  simple  as  CDE: 
C(oCos) + D(debt) + E(quity). The layer of bank equity would be augmented with a layer of 
CoCos,  with  slices  defined  by  market-based  triggers.  Banks’  capital  would  comprise  multi-
sliced  equity,  some  actual,  some  contingent.  In  some  respects,  this  model  is  not  greatly 
dissimilar to the one recently proposed by the Swiss banking commission.14 
In  achieving  this  capital  structure,  one  option  would  be  for  regulators  to  require  it,  as  in 
Switzerland. But it is possible that banks themselves might find such a capital structure in 
their own best interests. To see why, consider a standard model of optimal capital choice by 
a  value-maximising  firm.  The  firm  faces  a  trade-off.  Debt  confers  the  benefits  of  tax 
deductibility, while equity offers the benefits of lower expected bankruptcy costs.15 The trade-
off between these two sets of benefits defines an optimal capital ratio for a firm to maximise 
its expected value (Chart 9).16  
Now  consider  adding  CoCos  to  the  mix.  They  are,  in  effect,  a  hybrid  of  debt  and  equity 
whose payoffs depend on the state of nature. When nature is kind and times are good, they 
offer the upswing (tax-deductibility) benefits of debt. And when nature is cruel and times are 
bad,  they  offer  the  downswing  (bankruptcy  costs)  benefits  of  equity.  They  are,  in  the

language of economists, a form of “contingent” contract when the contingency in question is 
crisis.  
As Chart 10 illustrates, the optimal fraction of CoCos in banks’ optimal debt structure is likely 
to be non-zero. In other words, a CDE capital structure might be a smart option for value-
maximising investors and managers, even without the need for regulatory intervention. The 
social  value  of  such  a  capital  structure  might,  of  course,  be  greater  still  –  for  example, 
because  the  social  costs  of  crisis  are  higher  than  the  private  costs.  That  would  justify  a 
regulatory capital backstop.  
This  capital  structure  shares  the  risk-sharing  benefits  of  some  other  reform  proposals.  For 
example,  it  has  similar  risk-shifting  properties  to  a  mutual  fund  or  limited  purpose  banking 
model.17  When  required,  risk  is  shared  across  the  capital  structure,  as  in  a  mutual  fund 
whose equity claims adjust in value. But risk-spreading would only kick-in when it needs to. 
Banks  are  banks  when  nature  is  kind  and  mutual  funds  when  it  is  cruel.  They  can  be 
butterflies in summer, provided they are hedgehogs in winter. 
From here to there 
If such a structure is for the best in most states of the world, why does it not already exist? At 
least  two  legitimate  concerns  have  been  raised.  First,  might  market-based  triggers  invite 
speculative attack by short-sellers? The concern is that CoCo holders may be able to short-
sell a bank’s equity to force conversion, then using the proceeds of a CoCo conversion to 
cover their short position.  
There are several practical ways in which the contract design of CoCos could lean against 
these speculative incentives. Perhaps the simplest would be to base the conversion trigger 
on a weighted average of equity prices over some prior interval – say, 30 days.18 That would 
require  short-sellers  to  fund  their  short  positions  for  a  longer  period,  at  a  commensurately 
greater cost. It would also create uncertainty about whether conversion would indeed occur, 
given the risk of prices bouncing back and the short-seller suffering a loss. Both would act as 
a speculative disincentive.  
A second potential firewall against speculative attack could come from imposing restrictions 
on  the  ability  of  short-sellers  to  cover  their  positions  with  the  proceeds  of  conversion. 
Restrictions on naked short-selling are applied around the time of seasoned equity offerings 
in some jurisdictions.19 A rule to prevent the covering of short positions with the proceeds of a 
CoCo conversion could provide a further disincentive to destabilising short-selling of banks’ 
equity. 
A related concern is that CoCos alter the seniority structure of banks’ capital, as holders of 
CoCos  potentially  suffer  a  loss  ahead  of  equity-holders.  But  provided  the  price  at  which 
CoCos  convert  to  equity  is  close  to  the  market  price,  conversion  does  not  transfer  value 
between existing equity-holders and CoCo investors. And provided conversion is into equity 
it need not imply investor loss. If a market move really is unjustified, prices will correct over 
time towards fundamentals. The holder of a converted CoCo will then garner the upside. 
So while CoCos are susceptible to market aberrations, these can in my view be managed. In 
this  respect,  market  errors  are  fundamentally  different  to  model  errors.  Market  errors  are 
temporary risk, while model errors are permanent uncertainty. Market error can be managed,

while model error cannot. Put differently, with market-based CoCos the cost of Type I errors 
may be relatively modest for end-investors. 
A second key practical issue is whether it is plausible to imagine an investor base for CoCos 
emerging. Recent signs have been encouraging. Two major international banks have issued 
CoCos totalling around US$10bn since the start of the year. Credit Suisse recently issued a 
$2bn  CoCo  in  a  public  auction,  which  was  reportedly  11-times  over-subscribed.  Some 
market commentary suggests the CoCo market could grow to around $1 trillion over the next 
few years.20  
Despite that progress, investor demand for CoCos remains uncertain. Tellingly, none of the 
CoCos  issued  so  far  have  had  market-based  triggers,  none  have  a  graduated  ladder  of 
triggers and, in my view, none extend very far up banks’ capital structure. In short, the case 
for a CDE capital structure is, at present, unproven.  
But  there  may  be  simple,  evolutionary  ways  to  catalyse  market  demand  to  achieve  this 
capital  structure.  Perhaps  the  simplest  way  to  do  so  would  be  to  require  banks  to  make 
discretionary distributions to staff and shareholders in CoCos. In this way, an investor base 
for CoCos would emerge organically and grow in line with banks’ profits. 
As  well  as  catalysing  the  CoCo  market,  this  distributive  approach  would  have  two  further 
benefits.  First,  it  would boost  the  resilience  of  banks  by  keeping  revenues  in  the  business 
and  augmenting  banks’  capital  base.  Given  the  large  dividends  and  bonuses  paid  out  by 
banks historically, distributing in CoCos could increase banks’ capital base materially.  
Consider UK banks. Imagine that 50% of bonuses had been paid in CoCos rather than cash 
from 2000 to 2006. By 2007 at the start of the crisis, UK banks’ capital ratios would have 
been around 1 percentage point higher (Chart 11). Had 50% of dividends in addition been 
CoCoed, and assuming CoCos counted as Tier 1 capital, capital ratios would have been 3 
percentage points higher. That is roughly £70 billion, or around the amount of external capital 
UK banks raised during the crisis. 
Second,  CoCo  payouts  potentially  better  align  risk-taking  incentives  among  staff  and 
shareholders than cash or even equity payouts. The crisis demonstrated all too visibly some 
of  the  downsides  of  equity-based  remuneration.  One  is  the  temptation  to  gamble  for 
resurrection  when  poised  on  the  brink,  given  the  gambler’s  option  embedded  in  equity.  A 
second is the perverse incentive not to seek external equity because of the dilutive impact it 
might have on managerial wealth. Both of these adverse side-effects were evident at Bear 
Stearns and Lehman Brothers. 
Remunerating  management  in  CoCos  removes  this  temptation,  in  much  the  same  way  as 
would credibly loss-absorbing sub-ordinated debt.21 In peacetime, management is no longer 
offered  the  upside  of  equity,  only  the  downside.  The  asymmetry  of  payoffs  embedded  in 
peacetime bonus packages – “heads I win, tails society loses” – is neutralised somewhat by 
paying in CoCos. This better aligns risk for shareholders and staff with the risks for society at 
large.  
There is an old lesson, here, about eating your own cooking. This ought to help discipline the 
chefs,  reducing  the  temptation  to  pursue  risky  recipes  in  the  first  place.  Encouragingly, 
banking practice may already be beginning to match the theory. Several banks have recently 
announced they will in future consider remunerating shareholders and staff in CoCos.

Conclusion 
Tackling complex banking through complex regulation is to fight fire with fire. This is unlikely 
to  work  in  theory.  Crisis  experience  suggests  it  has  not  worked  in  practice.  A  regulatory 
framework is needed in which the state is neither omniscient Walrasian auctioneer (shouting 
out hundreds of millions of risk prices) nor deep-pocketed financier (doling out hundreds of 
billions of taxpayers’ money). A regulatory Gosplan will work no better for bankers than it did 
for tractors. 
The role of regulation is instead to set the overarching rules of the game. In tackling banking 
stress,  that  means  the  framework  for  banks’  capital  structure.  As  far  as  possible,  that 
framework should aim to leave the pricing of risk ex-ante, and the consequences of risk ex-
post, to the market. The framework outlined here could be one simple, robust and timely way 
to help achieve that. It is different. But it is far from radical. Nothing could be less radical than 
returning banks, and banking risk, to the market.

(a)  The  model  error  takes  the  probability  of  default  (PD)  for  each  given  risk  bucket  of  mortgagees  as  the 
realisation  of  a  uniformly-distributed  random  variable  across  the  range  of  possible  PDs  within  that  risk  bucket. 
This maps to a new risk-weighted assets number for the retail mortgage book, and a new capital ratio for this 
portion of the bank’s book (assuming the initial capital ratio is 100). This error is simulated 5,000 times for each of 
two banks and the chart shows the resulting distribution.

(a) “Crisis” banks are a set of major financial institutions which in autumn 2008 either failed, required government 
capital or were taken over in distressed circumstances. These are RBS, HBOS, Lloyds TSB, Bradford & Bingley, 
Alliance & Leicester, Citigroup, Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Merrill Lynch, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Goldman 
Sachs, ING Group, Dexia and Commerzbank. The chart shows an unweighted average for those institutions in 
the sample for which data are available on the given day. 
(b) The “no crisis” institutions are HSBC, Barclays, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, Santander, BNP Paribas, Deutsche 
Bank, Crédit Agricole, Société Générale, BBVA, Banco Popular, Banco Sabadell, Unicredit, Banca Popolare di 
Milano,  Royal  Bank  of  Canada,  National  Australia  Bank,  Commonwealth  Bank  of  Australia  and  ANZ  Banking 
Group. The chart shows an unweighted average for those banks in the sample for which data are available on the 
given day. 
(c) The dotted black line is a suggested trigger level for contingent capital calibrated by minimising a loss function 
which  takes  into  account  both  Type  I  and  Type  II  errors. Type  I  error  is  the  probability  that  conversion  occurs 
despite capital not being required. Type II error is the event that conversion does not occur despite capital being 
required. The loss function places greater weight on Type II errors. Note that the loss function takes into account 
the full range of banks, not just the average score for each set.

(a) A Type I error occurs when a bank’s ratio falls below the trigger level (calculated according to a loss function 
as described in charts 5–8) and capital is not required (defined as that bank not suffering a “crisis” over the next 
365 days). The number in this column is the proportion of days when a Type I error occurs. 
(b) Timely conversion is defined as a bank’s ratio falling below the trigger level no less than one month and no 
more than one year before a “crisis”. The number in this column is the proportion of “crisis” banks for which timely 
conversion does not occur (i,e, there is a Type II error) at this trigger level. 
(c) For each metric, the threshold for a signal of impending distress is as given in Charts 5 to 8.
