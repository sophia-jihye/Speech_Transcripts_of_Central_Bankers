Philipp Hildebrand: Overview of the Swiss and global economy 
Introductory  remarks  by  Mr  Philipp  Hildebrand,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the 
Swiss National Bank, at the half-yearly media news conference, Berne, 16 June 2011. 
 The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is maintaining its expansionary monetary policy. The target 
range  for  the  three-month  Libor  remains  at  0.0–0.75%,  and  the  SNB  intends  to  keep  the 
Libor within the lower part of the target range at around 0.25%.  
The global economic recovery is continuing, even if the outlook has dampened somewhat in 
the past few weeks. The level of capacity utilisation in the Swiss economy is rising. Despite 
the  strong  appreciation  of  the  Swiss  franc,  the  economy  continues  to  benefit  from  robust 
international demand. However, margins in the export industry are coming under increasing 
pressure.  For  2011,  the  SNB  is  maintaining  its  forecast  of  real  growth  in  Swiss  GDP  of 
around 2%.  
Overall,  however,  downside  risks  predominate.  These  include,  in  particular,  the  debt 
problems  in  the  euro  area  periphery.  In  addition,  high  deficits  require  several  countries  in 
various  parts  of  the  world  to  undertake  fiscal  consolidation  measures,  economic  fragility 
notwithstanding.  The  recent  commodity  price  increase  weighs  on  global  economic  growth 
and poses upside risks to inflation. In Switzerland, the main risks remain, on the one hand, 
the effects of the strong Swiss franc on the export industry and, on the other, the danger of 
overheating in the real estate sector.  
Until  the  beginning  of  2012,  the  path  of  the  SNB’s  conditional  inflation  forecast  lies  above 
that  of  the  previous  quarter’s  forecast.  This  is  attributable  to  the  assumption  of  higher  oil 
prices compared to the previous quarter and somewhat higher import prices. Assuming an 
unchanged three-month Libor of 0.25% over the forecast horizon, the SNB expects average 
inflation rates of 0.9% for 2011, 1.0% for 2012 and 1.7% for 2013. Over the course of 2012, 
the path of the new forecast is lower than that of March because of the latest appreciation of 
the Swiss franc and the slightly slower development of international growth. Towards the end 
of the forecast period, inflation rises briskly and exceeds the upper bound of 2%. This shows 
that the current expansionary monetary policy cannot be maintained over the entire forecast 
horizon  without  compromising  price  stability  in  the  long  term.  Due  to  the  risks  mentioned 
previously,  the  conditional  inflation  forecast  is,  however,  associated  with  a  high  level  of 
uncertainty.  
Global economic outlook 
Economic growth continued worldwide in the first quarter, although there were considerable 
regional  differences.  As  in  the  previous  quarters,  the  emerging  economies  recorded  the 
highest growth rates. In the euro area, particularly Germany, the recovery was supported by 
strong export and investment activity. In the US, by contrast, high energy prices weighed on 
sentiment and held back growth. In addition, the persistent crisis on the real estate market is 
hampering  the  economic  recovery.  In  Japan,  there  was  a  significant  decline  in  GDP  as  a 
result of the earthquake.  
Although the international economic outlook is somewhat less favourable than in March, the 
upswing in the global economy is likely to be maintained in the months ahead. In the US, in 
particular, the latest production and labour market indicators have been disappointing. Due to 
the high commodity prices and the production losses in Japan, the SNB has revised its 2011 
growth  forecast  for  the  advanced  economies  downwards  to  some  extent.  Moreover, 
numerous countries are planning to undertake additional cost-cutting measures in the year

ahead.  The  rise  in  commodity  prices  since  autumn  of  last  year  is  expected  to  result  in 
significantly higher inflation worldwide in 2011.  
Swiss economic outlook 
According to the SECO estimate, the growth of real GDP in Switzerland slowed in the first 
quarter,  mainly  because  of  the  muted  advance  in  private  consumption  and  equipment 
investment. By contrast, exports recorded a marked gain as a result of robust international 
demand, particularly from Germany and Asia, despite the strength of the Swiss franc. The 
strong  momentum  in  construction  also  supported  growth.  Utilisation  of  technical  capacity 
continued  to  pick  up  and  was  above  the  long-term  average  in  manufacturing;  in  the 
construction sector it actually attained a record high level. The recovery on the labour market 
also continued. After a massive increase during the crisis, measures introducing short-term 
work  have  largely  been  retracted.  In  May,  the  seasonally-adjusted  unemployment  ratio 
decreased  to  3.0%  and  companies  are  reporting  more  difficulties  in  recruiting  qualified 
employees. 
Due to the appreciation of the Swiss franc, export-geared companies are exposed to strong 
price competition. In manufacturing, in particular, margins are under very strong pressure in 
some  cases.  However,  survey  results  still  suggest  that  robust  foreign  demand  allows  for 
good utilisation of capacities and supports exports. The short-term outlook also remains good 
for  domestic  demand.  Construction  investment  is  benefiting  from  favourable  financing 
conditions, while higher capacity utilisation should stimulate equipment investment. Demand 
for labour is likely to firm further. For 2011, the SNB is maintaining its forecast of real GDP 
growth amounting to around 2%. 
Monetary and financial conditions  
Monetary conditions were again characterised by the divergence between low interest rates 
and  the  Swiss  franc,  which  appreciated  significantly  in  the  second  quarter.  Since  the  last 
monetary  policy  assessment,  the  three-month  Libor  has  persisted  in  the  lower  part  of  the 
target range. With inflation expectations rising slightly, real interest rates have remained low 
and  even,  in  the  short-term  range,  negative.  In  general,  although  long-term  interest  rates 
have risen since their low point in August 2010, they are still at a low level.  
By contrast, the real export-weighted Swiss franc appreciated further in the second quarter 
and  has  reached  an  all-time  high.  By  the  beginning  of  May,  the  US  dollar  –  mainly  –  had 
weakened significantly against the Swiss franc. Thereafter, renewed concerns about stability 
in the euro area also led to a depreciation of the euro. My colleague, Jean-Pierre Danthine, 
will speak about the situation on the international financial markets in more detail later on. 
The SNB is concerned about exchange rate developments. The SNB forecasts are based on 
the premise that the exchange rate developments will stabilise in the medium term. Should 
the exchange rate again be subject to significant changes, a reassessment of the inflation 
outlook would be required.  
Since the last monetary policy assessment, the M2 and M3 aggregates have been growing 
at  about  7%  year-on-year.  Some  of  this  high  growth  rate  is  attributable  to  the  current  low 
interest rates. Overall, ample liquidity is available in the economy and this means potential 
risks for price stability in the long term. 
Mortgage lending has also continued to increase substantially, growing at a rate of 4.7% in 
April. In an environment of low interest rates and substantial advances in real estate prices, a 
high rate of growth in mortgages can harbour risks for financial stability. In the speech that 
follows,  my  colleague  Thomas  Jordan  will  outline  for  you  the  SNB’s  Financial  Stability 
Report.  In  view  of  the  potential  risks  for  the  financial  sector,  the  SNB  continues  to  closely 
observe the situation on the mortgage and real estate markets.

Chart of conditional inflation forecast  
The  (dashed)  red  curve  on  the  chart  represents  the  new  conditional  inflation  forecast.  It 
shows the future path of inflation, assuming that the three-month Libor remains constant at 
0.25% over the next twelve quarters, and it covers the period from the first quarter of 2011 to 
the first quarter of 2014. For purposes of comparison, the (dash-dotted) green curve shows 
the  conditional  inflation  forecast  published  in  March,  which  was  also  based  on  the 
assumption of a three-month Libor of 0.25%. 
Until  the  beginning  of  2012,  the  path  of  the  SNB’s  new  conditional  inflation  forecast  lies 
above that of the previous quarter’s forecast. This is attributable to the assumption of higher 
oil  prices  compared  to  the  previous  quarter  and  somewhat  higher  import  prices.  The 
significant increase in the third quarter of 2011 is due to a base effect, because inflation in 
the  corresponding  quarter  of  2010  was  comparatively  low.  In  addition,  a  one-off  statistical 
effect can be expected in the third quarter of 2011. This is attributable to more frequent data 
collection in the case of prices for clothing and shoes; it also accounted for an increase in 
inflation  in  the  first  quarter.  During  the  course  of  2012,  the  path  of  the  new  forecast  falls 
below that of March, due to the slowdown in inflation attributable to the latest appreciation in 
the Swiss franc. Towards the end of the forecast period, inflation rises briskly and exceeds 
the upper bound of 2%. This shows that the current expansionary monetary policy cannot be 
maintained over the entire forecast horizon without compromising price stability in the long 
term.  Due  to  the  risks  mentioned  previously,  the  conditional  inflation  forecast  is,  however, 
associated with a high level of uncertainty.
