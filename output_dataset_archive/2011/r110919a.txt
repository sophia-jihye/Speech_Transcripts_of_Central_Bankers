Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Sasana Kijang – Malaysia’s centre for central banking 
and financial collaboration and cooperation 
Welcoming remarks by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the 
launch of Sasana Kijang, Kuala Lumpur, 14 September 2011. 
 It is my honour and great pleasure to welcome you to the official opening of Sasana Kijang. 
Today we are also honoured by the presence of Yang Amat Berhormat, the Prime Minister of 
Malaysia to officiate the launch of Sasana Kijang. Sasana Kijang began with a vision to have 
a centre for the development of thought leadership and for the promotion of greater regional 
and  international  collaboration  in  Central  Banking  and  finance.  Sasana  Kijang  is  also  an 
integral  part  of  the  initiatives  that  have  been  undertaken  by  Bank  Negara  Malaysia  in  the 
modernisation and transformation of our Central Bank. These have involved the introduction 
of new legislation and governance arrangements, the increased leverage on technology, the 
adoption  of  new  practices  in  the  management  of  talent,  work  arrangements  and  corporate 
culture,  as  well  as  the  new  institutional  arrangements  that  facilitate  our  cooperation  and 
collaboration with other monetary authorities and regulators in other parts of the world. 
The global economic and financial landscape is currently at an important turning point, as we 
transition to a fundamentally changed future. The challenges facing us in this environment 
are  manifold.  We  therefore  want  to  have  the  skills  for  this  future  –  to  be  well  equipped  to 
effectively manage our future. Sasana Kijang aims to provide such a platform to pursue this 
human capital development agenda to become a centre of excellence for learning with the 
state of the art facilities. 
Sasana Kijang also reflects our commitment for regional and international collaboration and 
cooperation.  It  is  our  intention  for  Sasana  Kijang  to  provide  a  platform  for  the  meeting  of 
minds and to harness the wealth of expertise in the field of Central Banking and finance. As a 
centre  for  collaboration,  Sasana  Kijang  has  wide  ranging  facilities  for  regional  and 
international meetings, seminars and conferences. These facilities are also shared with the 
South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN) Research and Training Centre and the Islamic 
Financial Services Board (IFSB) which are now located in Sasana Kijang. For the SEACEN 
Centre, it is hoped that all the available facilities will support its enhanced role in the region, 
particularly,  as  financial  and  economic  integration  in  Asia  intensifies.  For  the  IFSB,  an 
international  organisation  that  was  established  as  a  result  of  the  collaborative  efforts  of 
regulators from different parts of the world, it is hoped that it will facilitate further collaboration 
in the development of Islamic finance and in safeguarding its soundness and stability. 
This is in fact what Sasana means in Sanskrit – a convening point for the wise and learned. 
When combined with Kijang, a word that is strongly associated with the Bank, Sasana Kijang 
represents a powerful meaning that is consistent with our identity. The architectural concept 
of Sasana Kijang is also inspired from our earliest form of currency that was used in the third 
century and which denotes a harmony of simplicity and class. And the facade design of the 
building  is  derived  from  the  geometric  patterns  of  the  traditional  Malaysian  songket  fabric 
which is woven with intricate gold and silver threads which creates a strong bond, thus giving 
the fabric its strength and elegance. This is similar to the Central Banking community that is 
interlinked  through  our  similar  objectives  and  bonded  through  collaboration  and  strategic 
alliances.  Other  features  of  the  building  is  the  extensive  use  of  glass  which  allows  for  the 
greater use of natural light. The building also features a range of green technologies as part 
of our commitment and responsibility to the environment. 
Finally, another important part of Sasana Kijang is the Bank Negara Malaysia Currency and 
Economics Museum and the Art Gallery that will be opened to the public. These collections 
that  have  been  built  since  the  earliest  days  of  our  Bank  over  a  period  of  more  than  five

decades  aim  to  foster  greater  understanding  on  the  history  of  our  currencies  and  of  our 
economy  and  financial  system,  and  also  represents  our  support  to  contemporary  art  in 
Malaysia and thus contribute towards preserving the heritage of our country. 
Allow  me  now  to  invite  Yang  Amat  Berhormat,  Dato’  Sri  Mohd.  Najib  bin  Tun  Haji  Abdul 
Razak to deliver his address and to officially launch Sasana Kijang.
