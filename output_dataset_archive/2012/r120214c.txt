Guy Debelle: On Europe’s effects on Australian financial markets 
Address by Mr Guy Debelle, Assistant Governor (Financial Markets) of the Reserve Bank of 
Australia, to Bloomberg Seminar, Sydney, 14 February 2012. 
 Thanks to Justin Fabo, Craig Evans and Tom Rosewall for their help with this talk. 
Europe has been at front of mind a lot of late. The almost daily machinations of the European 
political  behemoth  have  been  a  major  driver  of  financial  market  volatility.  On  that,  I  was 
pleasantly  surprised  that  the  Australian  summer  holiday  was  relatively  uninterrupted  by 
European headlines. But the downside was that we didn’t really get summer in Sydney. 
European  developments  influence  Australian  financial  markets  through  a  number  of 
channels. I will focus on a few of those today. 
I think the European development that has had the most material impact on financial markets 
over  the  past  few  months  has  been  the  European  Central  Bank’s  (ECB)  3-year  liquidity 
operation. In December, the ECB provided as much 3-year funding as the European banking 
sector  desired  at  the  ECB’s  policy  rate  (against  acceptable  collateral).  Nearly  €500 billion 
euros was borrowed.  
This large liquidity injection has had a number of effects. One of the more important is that it 
effectively takes funding out of the equation for the European banking system in the period 
ahead. There are large maturities of bank debt falling due around now, a sizeable share of 
which is government-guaranteed (Graph 1). There were serious concerns about the ability of 
some banks to refinance themselves, but these concerns have been alleviated by the ECB’s 
actions. The ECB has provided banks with the funds to repay these obligations and indeed 
ECB commentary suggests that a number of those who borrowed were those with large debt 
maturities coming up.

In  assessing  the  impact  of  the  ECB’s  actions,  some  commentators  focus  on  the  size  of 
banks’  deposits  with  the  ECB  as  a  measure  of  their  effectiveness.  If  these  deposits  are 
rising, the assessment is that the ECB’s actions aren’t working, because the banks are just 
parking their money at the ECB and not lending it to the real economy.  
Such an assessment is inaccurate. The size of the banking system’s deposits with the ECB 
is completely determined by the ECB’s liquidity operations. On the ECB’s balance sheet, the 
assets it generates by lending to the banking system must also appear on the liabilities side 
as bank deposits with the ECB.  That is, once the ECB has done its liquidity operations, the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

size of ECB balance sheet is what it is. The amount of deposits provides no real information 
above and beyond the net amount the ECB has injected into the system, which is already 
known. It does not tell you anything about what the banks are doing with the funds they have 
borrowed from the ECB. Or about how many times those funds circulate before ending up 
back at the ECB. 
This is true of all central banks, not just the ECB. A similarly misleading statement is often 
made about the Fed, with bank deposits “piling up” at the Fed supposedly indicating that the 
Fed’s policy actions are ineffective. Again, the size of banks’ deposits at the Fed is the mirror 
image of the Fed’s liquidity operations. 
One possible way to gain a handle on the impact of these operations, and the extent to which 
the liquidity has circulated, is to look at money multipliers. Graph 2 shows money multipliers 
for the euro area, the US and the UK. The money multiplier is the ratio of a broad measure of 
the money supply to the money base, which is the part that is more or less under the control 
of  the  central  bank.  The  graph  shows  that  there  have  been  large  declines  in  the  money 
multiplier in all three regions.

 These declines provide some indication that the banks aren’t circulating the liquidity as much 
as was the case in the recent past. The declines are consistent with the deleveraging that is 
occurring in the banking sector and on private sector balance sheets. It also suggests that 
the economies in each of these regions are likely to have been significantly weaker if not for 
the large expansion of central bank balance sheets.   
While the ECB’s liquidity provision significantly reduces the funding risk for European banks, 
there  are  still  pressures  in  terms  of  bank  capital.  A  number  of  European  banks  are 
responding to these pressures by deleveraging rather than by raising equity in the market. 
Some of that is evident in Australia and the Asian region more generally, particularly around 
the provision of commodity finance. However, at least in Australia’s case, European banks 
do not have a large presence, and thus far we have seen other banks step in to offset some 
of the withdrawal.  
There are also clearly still significant issues in terms of sovereign debt to be resolved. The 
ECB will conduct another 3-year operation at the end of the month. There is some possibility 
that banks will use that operation to fund increased purchases of sovereign debt and earn 
the large carry on offer, which might help alleviate the sovereign pressures for a time.  
Graph 2 showed the collapse in money multipliers that has occurred. But it is also interesting 
to think about the equivalent concept on the other side of the balance sheet, what might be 
called collateral multipliers. That is, how many times do assets get recycled in the system, 
particularly  in  terms  of  generating  funding.  Collateral  multipliers  don’t  appear  in  standard 
2

textbooks, but they are an important construct in the world of shadow banking, where repo, 
collateral hypothecation etc are crucial. Some very interesting work has been done on this in 
recent times, including by Manmohan Singh and Zoltan Pozsar at the IMF, along with James 
Aitken.1 Hyun Shin and others have developed a useful framework in which to think about the 
issue.2  
The evidence seems to be that there is a sizeable reduction in the velocity of collateral taking 
place. Some of this is because of a change in the willingness to lend securities on the part of 
some asset managers, some is a function of regulatory changes. This has implications for 
the  provision  of  credit,  particularly  from  the  shadow  banking  sector.  It  is  an  area  which  is 
certainly worth examining in more detail.  
Returning  to  the  topic  of  debt  issuance,  the  new  year  has  seen  a  thawing  in  bank  debt 
markets. Some of this I think can be attributed to the calendar itself. Investors were reluctant 
to take any position towards the end of 2011, either to lock in gains already accrued or to 
avoid exacerbating losses in an environment of considerable uncertainty. With the beginning 
of the new year, the investment slate is clean and risk tolerance thus far is on the increase. 
This development has been bolstered by the avoidance of worst case outcomes and, as I’ve 
already mentioned, by the ECB’s action. 
However, there is a reasonably large amount of bank debt maturing in the first quarter and 
concerns  continue  to  be  expressed  about  that.  In  that  regard,  it  is  always  important  to 
remember that when the debt matures, the investor in the maturing paper has to decide what 
to do with the cash. Do they reinvest in bank debt or do they invest it somewhere else? In the 
current  quarter,  an  additional  wrinkle  in  thinking  about  this  is  that  a  fair  chunk  of  debt 
maturing is government-guaranteed bank paper. So the decisions of some of these investors 
may not be the same as those of more traditional bank credit investors. 
But while the market has reopened in the new year, there has been a sizeable step up in the 
cost of the issuance. Investors are demanding much higher compensation for bank credit risk 
now  than  they  were  in  mid  2011.  The  repricing  probably  happened  in  the  last  quarter  of 
2011, but the general lack of issuance made it more difficult to observe. 
This  global  repricing  of  bank  debt  has  clearly  affected  the  Australian  banks’  wholesale 
funding costs. The Reserve Bank will provide a detailed analysis of this in the March Bulletin. 
Table 1 provides some illustration of recent developments.

It  shows  that  the  covered  bonds  issued  by  the  Australian  banks  were  at  markedly  wider 
spreads  than  their  unsecured  issuance  mid  year.  This  is  notwithstanding  the  fact  that 
covered bonds are senior in the creditor queue. While the cost of the first wave of covered 
bond  issuance  by  the  Australian  banks  has  been  high,  it  is  broadly  comparable  to  that  of 
recent covered issuance by banks in other jurisdictions where there has been a similar step 
up in cost (Graph 3). 
In  the  past  few  days,  there  has  been  a  sizeable  narrowing  of  spreads  in  the  secondary 
market  on  the  domestically  issued  covered  bonds,  to  around  140  points  over  swap.  This 
narrowing in bank credit spreads was confirmed by the unsecured issuance last week.

 The other point of interest in Table 1 is that some corporates are able to issue at lower rates 
than the banks, even for the AAA-rated covered bonds. For example, Coke, which is rated  
A-,  was  able  to  issue  more  than  100 basis  points  below  the  AAA  rated  domestic  covered 
bond issues.

The  rise  in  wholesale  funding  costs  has  been  accentuated  for  funds  raised  offshore  by  a 
widening in the cost of swapping foreign exchange into Australian dollars (Graph 4). This is 
another example of European issues affecting the local market, as the widening is partly a 
function of the lower volume of Kangaroo issuance in recent months. The Kangaroo issuers 
seek to swap the $A funding they raise back into foreign currency, while the Australian banks 
do the reverse with their foreign currency raisings.

 Over the past few years, issuance in the first quarter, particularly by Kangaroo issuers, has 
been  strong.  That  has  not  been  the  case  so  far  this  year.  Ratings  uncertainty  around 
European sovereigns has contributed to this. With the downgrade of a number of European 
sovereigns  by  some  rating  agencies  in  December,  including  France,  some  pan  European 
entities,  including  the  European  Financial  Stability  Facility  (EFSF),  were  downgraded.  The 
European Investment Bank (EIB), historically a large issuer in the Australian market, was not 
downgraded, although it remains on negative watch. At times, there has been poor liquidity in 
the market, which has seen spreads on supranational debt marked a lot wider, particularly 
EIB, with little turnover behind the wider marks. Again, reflecting improved sentiment, those 
spreads have started to narrow. 
The  final  channel  I  want  to  talk  about  today  is  the  sizeable  flows  occurring  into  Australian 
government  debt.  This  has  been  evident  for  quite  a  few  quarters  now  in  the  balance  of 
payments  statistics  (Graph 5).  Over  the  first  three  quarters  of  2011,  the  net  purchases  of 
government  securities  by  foreigners  amounted  to  over  3 per cent  of  GDP,  markedly  larger 
than the current account deficit. This pattern of capital flows likely continued in the December 
quarter.  
As a result of these purchases, based on the ABS financial accounts data, our estimate is 
that around 75 per cent of the stock of Commonwealth Government securities (CGS) is held 
offshore,  as  at  end  September.  Our  discussions  with  market  participants  suggest  that  a 
sizeable share of recent purchases has been by sovereign asset managers. These investors 
tend to buy CGS predominantly (though not exclusively), rather than debt issued by the state 
government borrowing authorities (semis). This has contributed to the widening in spreads 
between CGS and semis. However, as the yields on CGS have fallen to 50-year lows, state 
borrowing  costs  are  not  all  that  high  by  historical  standards  notwithstanding  the  wider 
spreads.

 This portfolio shift by foreign asset managers appears to be having an effect on the currency. 
The  Australian  dollar  is  close  to  its  recent  highs  despite  the  terms  of  trade  declining  from 
their peak in the September quarter. 
Conclusion 
So  these  are  some  of  the  channels  of  influence  of  the  situation  in  Europe  on  Australian 
financial markets. So far this year, that has been a more positive story than it was at the end 
of  the  last  year.  The  major  instigator  of  this  change,  in  my  opinion,  was  the  ECB’s  3-year 
liquidity operation. Whether this happier state of affairs persists is difficult to tell. There have 
been outbreaks of optimism over the past couple of years which were dashed.  
I think the only thing which is certain, is that uncertainty is likely to persist for some time to 
come.  In  that  regard  I’d  like  to  finish  with  a  variation  on  the  famous  Rumfeldian  take  on 
uncertainty, recently articulated by David Murphy on his Deus Ex Macchiato blog: There are 
known unknowns and unknown unknowns, which complicate the pricing of risk, but over the 
past decade, there has also been a fair few examples of “too-lazy-to-be-knowns”. European 
sovereign debt before 2007 might conceivably fall into that category. While mispricing due to 
Knightian uncertainty is excusable, mispricing due to laziness is not. As I said last November, 
you’ve  got  to  Know  Your  Product,  otherwise,  it  can  quickly  turn  into  a  case  of  No,  Your 
Product.3 
                                                 
3   Aficionados of the Saints will be aware that these two songs bookend side one of Eternally Yours. This can be 
translated  into  financial  terms  as:  If  you  owe  the  bank  $100,  that’s  your  problem.  If  you  owe  the  bank 
$100 million, that’s the bank’s problem.
