Charles Bean: Pension funds and quantitative easing 
Speech by Mr Charles Bean, Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy of the Bank of England, 
to  the  National  Association  of  Pension  Funds’  Local  Authority  Conference,  Cotswolds, 
Gloucestershire, 23 May 2012.

 Thank you, Joanne (Segars), for that kind introduction. When I was invited to address this 
conference, I was asked to discuss how the Monetary Policy Committee’s asset purchases  
– colloquially, though rather inelegantly, known as quantitative easing or QE for short – affect 
pension funds. I was actually quite pleased to be assigned this brief, as in my view some of 
the commentary regarding QE has taken a rather partial view of its effects. Not only is the 
adverse impact of QE on pension funds often exaggerated, but the excessive focus on QE 
as a cause of low long-term risk-free interest rates also risks distracting attention from other 
factors  driving  yields  which  may  present  a  more  durable  challenge  to  the  sponsors  and 
trustees of pension funds. 
To begin with, it may be helpful if I remind you how QE works and what it seeks to achieve. 
QE essentially involves us trading one liability of the state – gilts – for another – monetary 
claims  on  the  Bank  of  England.1  The  maturity  structure  of  our  purchases  is  designed  to 
ensure  that  the  gilts  are  largely  sourced  from  private  sector  non-bank  investors,  such  as 
insurance  companies,  pension  funds  and  hedge  funds.  So,  as  a  result  of  our  operations, 
investors  end  up  holding  fewer  gilts,  together  with  more  cash  in  their  bank  accounts.  And 
corresponding  to  that  increase  in  bank  deposits,  the  banks  themselves  see  their  reserves 
accounts at the Bank of England increase.  
If the seller were indifferent between holding the gilt and holding the associated bank deposit, 
then that is where things would end. But because deposits tend to yield less than gilts and 
assets such as corporate bonds and equities, the seller is likely in due course to want to buy 
some  other  asset  instead.  The  consequence  is  upward  pressure  on  the  prices  of  a  whole 
range  of  assets,  including  corporate  bonds  and  equities.  That  in  turn  increases  the 
availability,  and  reduces  the  cost,  of  finance  to  corporates.  It  also  boosts  the  value  of 
people's wealth, which should encourage more spending. And, more generally, QE is likely to 
have boosted confidence by removing some of the worst downside risks associated with a 
potential slide into deflation. 
As  I  noted  a  moment  ago,  we  aim  to  source  the  gilts  from  institutions  other  than  banks. 
Because the banks end up with more customer deposits and more liquid assets, they may be 
encouraged  to  extend  more  bank  credit.  In  this  way,  QE  could  boost  the  supply  of  credit 
through the banking system, as well as through the capital markets. But in the circumstances 
prevailing after the financial crisis, with the banks engaged in repairing their balance sheets, 
this  particular  channel  was  expected  to  be  weak.  What  is  probably  more  relevant  to  the 
supply  of  credit  at  the  current  juncture  is  the  amount  of  bank  capital  and  the  cost  and 
availability of bank funding. QE may then boost credit supply indirectly if it leads investors to 
increase their demand for bank debt and equity.  
As you will be aware, the Monetary Policy Committee has so far purchased £325 billion of 
gilts,  £200  billion  in  a  first  phase  during  the  worst  of  the  recession  in  2009  (QE1)  and 
£125 billion in a second phase as the economy slowed at the end of last year and which was 
                                                 
1  Cash can be thought of a zero-interest perpetuity issued by the state. But it has value because it can be used 
in transactions. The MPC’s asset purchases are actually financed by issuing bank reserves which pay Bank 
Rate rather than nothing and which can be easily converted into cash.

completed  shortly  before  our  latest  policy  meeting  (QE2).  To  give  some  context,  that 
represents around a quarter of the total stock of UK government debt in issue. It is, though, 
important  to  remember  that  throughout  this  time  the  Debt  Management  Office  has  been 
issuing  substantial  net  quantities  of  new  gilts  in  order  to  fund  the  Government’s  budget 
deficit.  So,  despite  the  scale  of  our  purchases,  the  stock  of  conventional  gilts  held  by  the 
private sector is actually higher now than when we started our purchases (see Chart 1). 
What  impact  have  our  purchases  had  on  asset  prices?  Chart  2  shows  the  evolution  of  a 
representative gilt yield and an equity price index from the beginning of 2007, just before the 
start of the financial crisis. I have also marked on the periods when the MPC was buying gilts 
in grey. When there is bad news about the economic outlook, one would expect to see gilt 
yields and equity prices both falling. That is indeed what one observes during late 2008/early 
2009 at the worst of the crisis after Lehman’s collapsed, and again in the early autumn of last 
year as the euro-area crisis intensified and growth slowed. 
As  already  noted,  though,  our  asset  purchases  should  drive  down  gilt  yields  and  push  up 
equity prices, other things equal. Equity prices behave as expected in both QE1 and QE2, as 
does the gilt yield during QE2. The gilt yield was, however, broadly flat over the period of 
QE1.  That  probably  reflects  the  influence  of  other  factors  working  against  our  asset 
purchases. In particular, during 2009 market concerns about the lack of a fully credible plan 
to  close  the  fiscal  deficit  over  the  medium  term  increased  somewhat,  which  would  have 
tended to push up yields. In recent months the opposite appears to have been true. Market 
confidence  in  the  UK  Government’s  commitment  to  fiscal  consolidation,  together  with 
heightened concerns about the fiscal positions of some euro-area sovereigns, has exerted 
downward pressure on gilt yields. 
Quantifying the impact of QE requires one to abstract from these other influences on asset 
prices.  One  way  of  doing  that  is  by  looking  at  the  immediate  movements  in  asset  prices 
around announcements of purchases. As market participants are forward-looking, one might 
expect  the  bulk  of  the  movement  associated  with  QE  to  happen  when  the  purchases  are 
announced  rather  than  when  they  take  place.  And  indeed  that  approach  seems  to  work 
reasonably well for identifying the impact of QE1 on the yields on gilts, and those on close 
substitutes  such  as  corporate  bonds.  Analysis  by  Bank  staff2  suggests  that  long-term  gilt 
yields were around one percentage point lower than they would otherwise have been; that 
corresponds  to  a  rise  in  long-term  gilt  prices  of  around  20%.  Investment-grade  corporate 
bond  yields3  fell  by  about  the  same  amount,  while  high-yield  corporate  bonds  fell  by 
somewhat more. 
This  approach  is  less  suited  to  analysing  the  impact  of  QE2.  The  deterioration  in  the 
economic situation, speeches by MPC members, and the minutes of the September policy 
meeting all encouraged market participants to expect a re-commencement of the purchase 
programme. As a result, the effects were already largely incorporated into the general level 
of bond prices prior to the MPC’s actual announcement of the new programme in October, so 
it becomes difficult to disentangle the effect of QE. Ahead of that announcement, however, 
UK  sovereign  bond  yields  did  fall  relative  to  those  in  Germany  and  the  United  States, 
consistent with an effect from QE. 
Moreover,  in  February  we  did  make  an  unexpected  announcement  of  a  change  in  the 
maturity  structure  of  our  purchases.  This  was  intended  to  prevent  the  Bank’s  holdings 
becoming  unduly  concentrated  in  any  particular  segment  of  the  market  and  had  the

around 150 basis points.

consequence of shifting them more towards shorter durations. The subsequent response of 
yields at different maturities was broadly in line with what would have been expected on the 
basis of our first round of purchases (see Chart 3). 
The approach is also less suited to analysing the impact on the prices of assets which are 
less immediate substitutes, such as equities. These are likely to take longer to adjust, as it 
probably  takes  a  while  for  portfolio  managers  to  decide  how  they  want  to  rebalance  their 
portfolios.  But,  as  Chart  2  shows,  equity  prices  rose  substantially  once  QE  was  actually 
under way – by around 50% during QE1 and around 10% during QE2. In both cases, the 
switch from decline to growth coincides with the commencement of asset purchases. 
It seems unlikely that all of the recovery in equity prices during these periods was down to 
our QE. During both phases of the programme, the US Federal Reserve undertook similar 
policies, and in recent months the ECB has injected large amounts of liquidity through its two 
longer-term refinancing operations. Equity prices rose in those jurisdictions too. Many of the 
companies  in  the  equity  price  indices  are  international  in  focus  and  will  be  as  exposed  to 
developments abroad as in their home market. Moreover, there will have been other factors 
affecting equity prices, though during the second programme those other factors – slowing 
growth and the worsening euro-area situation – seem more likely to have depressed equity 
prices, rather than boosted them. 
Given that  QE is supposed to operate by driving asset prices up, however, it  would seem 
peculiar not to ascribe some part of the rise to our actions. Econometric studies4 carried out 
at the Bank imply that equity prices probably rose by about 20% as a result of the first phase 
of  purchases.  Assuming  QE2  has  proportionately  the  same  effect  as  QE1,  this  implies  an 
increase  of  around  10%  as  a  result  of  the  second  phase  of  purchases.  In  other  words, 
around  half  of  the  rise  over  the  two  episodes  taken  together  appears  attributable  to  QE.  I 
should, however, emphasise the considerable uncertainty around these estimates. 
Let me now turn to the question of how this all affects a pension fund. Conceptually we can 
split  the  obligations  of  a  Defined  Benefit  pension  scheme  into  two  components:  pension 
obligations  to  current  and  former  staff  that  have  already  been  accumulated;  and  new 
obligations arising from the additional pension rights earned by the current staff in the current 
year through additional service and any increase in pay. The first component will dominate in 
the case of anything other than a very new scheme, so let me concentrate on that for now. In 
turn, I will consider the impact on: a fund that is balanced and hedged; one that is initially in 
balance  but  exposed  to  market  risk;  and  one  that  is  initially  in  deficit,  as  well  as  being 
exposed to market risk.  
Now the existing pension obligations will typically be for a fixed flow of real income, that is 
the pension entitlement will be adjusted for inflation. In principle, an employer could therefore 
exactly match his pension obligations by holding a portfolio comprising indexed government 
debt of appropriate durations.5 In this case, a change in the yields on government bonds as a 
result  of  QE,  or  indeed  on  any  other  assets,  would  not  alter  the  position  of  the  fund  one  
iota  –  its  obligations  would  still  be  completely  covered.  In  this  case,  the  change  in  the 
valuation of the liabilities is exactly matched by a change in the valuation of the assets. 
Of course, most pension funds do not seek to match their assets exactly to their obligations 
in this way. Most will seek to cheapen the cost of meeting their obligations by holding higher

Thomas (2012), “The impact of QE on the UK economy  – some supportive monetarist arithmetic”, Bank of 
England Working Paper No.442, January. 
In practice, a scheme is unlikely to be able to protect itself fully from interest rate risk, because there is only a 
limited range of swaps available to fill gaps in the maturity structure of government debt. I am also abstracting 
from uncertainty about longevity.

yielding assets, such as corporate bonds and equities, rather than just (indexed) government 
bonds. This implies some extra risk, but is presumably judged acceptable if it reduces the 
contribution  rate  sufficiently  in  most  states  of  the  world.  A  typical  pension  fund  might  hold 
around 40% bonds and 60% equities,6 and the illustrative figures below assume such a mix. 
To  begin  with,  consider  a  scheme  that  started  off  2007  in  balance.  To  keep  the  picture 
simple, I will assume that the liabilities are discounted by the gilt yield, so that the valuation of 
liabilities moves with this yield; any changes in longevity and the like are ignored so as to 
focus  on  the  implications  of  asset  price  movements.  In  practice,  of  course,  for  accounting 
purposes  many  pension  fund  sponsors  use  an  investment-grade  corporate  bond  rate  to 
discount their liabilities; an annex shows what things look like in this case. 
Chart  4  shows  how  the  deficit  of  this  fund  evolves,  decomposed  into  the  cumulative 
contributions  of  the  liabilities  (green  bars)  and  assets,  comprising  equities  (red  bars)  and 
bonds (blue bars). Note that the deficit rises as high as 30% of initial liabilities in early 2009, 
reflecting the sharp fall in equity prices during the worst of the financial crisis and subsequent 
recession. The deficit then falls back as equity prices rally strongly. It then re-emerges in late 
2011  and  early  2012,  reflecting  the  fall  in  gilt  yields  coupled  with  the  more  modest 
movements in equity prices during this episode. 
Now consider what the picture might have looked like if the MPC had not undertaken any 
QE.  In  constructing  this  counterfactual  experiment,  I  take  the  estimates  of  the  asset-price 
impact for QE1 from the work that I discussed earlier, namely that it reduced gilt yields by a 
percentage point and raised equity prices by 20%, and then simply pro-rate those effects for 
QE2. I emphasise again that these are only estimates of the effect of QE and are subject to 
considerable  uncertainty,  so  the  results  of  this  exercise  should  be  treated  as  illustrative 
rather than definitive. 
Chart  5  shows  the  result.  The  value  of  liabilities  (green  bars)  is  lower  from  early  2009 
onwards, which on its own pushes the fund towards surplus, but working against that there is 
now much less of a recovery in equities, while the value of bond holdings is also lower. The 
overall path of the deficit is very similar, as can be seen more clearly in Chart 6, which just 
shows the two deficits together. So the bottom line is that QE is broadly neutral for a fund 
that starts in balance, with the overall movement in assets broadly matching the movement in 
liabilities. 
Not all funds, however, started 2007 in balance. Indeed, the Purple Book, published by the 
Pension  Protection  Fund  and  the  Pensions  Regulator,  suggests  that  the  average  pension 
fund deficit was equal to about 30% of total liabilities, calculated on a full buy-out basis. The 
consequence of this is to shrink the red and blue bars in Charts 4 and 5 by 30% (the time 
profiles  are  otherwise  the  same),  reflecting  the  shortage  of  assets  to  meet  such  a  fund's 
obligations. The implications for the deficit, with and without QE, are shown in Chart 7. Now 
QE widens the deficit from the start of our purchases in early 2009 onwards, and by the end 
of the period has raised it by about 10% of initial liabilities. This is, by the way, of the same 
order as some calculations of the impact of QE produced by the Pension Corporation late 
last year.7 
There are a couple of conclusions I want to draw from this. The first is that while the change 
in  the  deficit  is  certainly  not  trivial  for  a  substantially  underfunded  scheme,  the  impact  of 
QE is  nevertheless  small  compared  to  the  movement  in  the  deficit  associated  with  other 
factors,  such  as  the  collapse  in  equity  prices  as  a  result  of  the  financial  crisis  and  the 
                                                 
6  This  is  broadly  consistent  with  the  NAPF  Annual  Survey  for  2011,  which  suggests  an  average  mix  of 
40% fixed income, 40% equities and 20% other assets, the prices of which I have assumed evolve in line with 
equities. The bonds are assumed to move in line with 15 year gilts, while the equities are assumed to move in 
line with the UK FTSE All-share index.

recession. In particular, it would be an error to attribute the deterioration in pension deficits 
since the start of the crisis solely to the impact of QE. 
The second observation is that QE does not inherently raise pension deficits. It all depends 
on  the  initial  position  of  the  fund,  with  the  movements  in  liabilities  and  assets  likely  to  be 
broadly comparable when a scheme is fully funded. But the more a scheme is underfunded 
(overfunded) to begin with, the more it will find its deficit (surplus) increased. This is entirely 
intuitive. By reducing yields, QE increases the cost of purchasing a given future stream of 
income. So if a fund starts off relatively “asset poor”, the sponsors will now find it more costly 
to acquire the assets necessary to match its future obligations. 
A  corollary  of  this  is  that  the  cost  of  provisioning  against  additional  pension  entitlements 
being accumulated by currently serving staff unambiguously rises. That does mean that the 
effective cost of employing labour, when their pension costs are also included, also rises.8 
This  is  certainly  an  unwanted  side  effect  of  QE.  But  it  needs  to  be  balanced  against  the 
higher activity and business profits resulting from QE, as well as the fact that wage growth 
has recently been exceptionally weak, which work in the opposite direction.  
Given that pension funds have for the most part seen deficits widen in recent years, whether 
it be as a result of the crisis and recession or the result of QE, how should sponsors and 
trustees  respond?  It  makes  little  sense  to  rush  to  close  a  deficit  that  is  likely  to  prove 
temporary.  But  if  a  deficit  is  likely  to  persist,  then  corrective  action  is  required,  initially  to 
prevent it continuing to expand and ultimately to close it, though that adjustment could, quite 
reasonably, be spread out over time. This is all recognised by the Pensions Regulator. 
The biggest issue here is not the principles involved, but rather the likely future evolution of 
yields and asset prices. Here I think it is worth stepping back from recent developments to 
consider the behaviour of yields over a longer horizon. Chart 8 shows the nominal and real 
yields  on  UK  and  US  government  debt  over  the  past  twenty  years.  Though  yields  have 
dipped recently, the most striking feature of this chart is the general downward trend that was 
evident for some years even before the financial crisis. 
The  causes  of  this  downward  trend  are  still  not  well  understood.  Some  have  pointed  to  a 
global  “savings  glut”  associated  with  unusually  high  levels  of  savings  in  some  emerging 
economies,9 especially China, which have been more than enough to finance the high levels 
of investment there. That was reflected in downward pressure on global safe interest rates, 
as well as the pattern of current account imbalances. While the Chinese surplus has fallen in 
recent years, reflecting in part efforts to stimulate domestic demand, that has been offset by 
a  widening  in  the  surplus  of  the  major  oil  producers  as  increased  revenues  resulting  from 
high  oil  prices  are  largely  saved  rather  than  spent.  While  one  might  expect  the  Chinese 
economy to continue to rebalance towards greater reliance on domestic demand and lower 
savings,  that  process  is  likely  to  take  many  years  to  play  out,  so  an  early  reversal  of  that 
factor holding down yields seems unlikely. 
Another  possibility  is  a  shortage  of  high-quality  safe  assets,10  with  countries  like  China 
accumulating reserves particularly in the form of US Treasuries. That in turn will also have 
increased  the  demand  for  substitutes,  including  the  government  debt  of  other  advanced 
economies.  But  recent  events  in  the  euro  area  have  highlighted  the  fact  that  the  debt  of 
                                                 
8  For instance, if an employer is putting aside an additional 15% of the wage bill to cover accumulating pension 
liabilities and the price of buying a given stream of future income rises by 20%, then he would now need to put 
aside an additional 3% of the wage bill to meet those obligations.

some  sovereigns  is  not  as  safe  as  market  participants  thought.  That  has  led  to  increased 
demand for the debt of those sovereigns that are still regarded as safe, including that of the 
United Kingdom. How long such a “safe-haven discount” persists depends not only on what 
happens in this country but also what happens abroad: the demand for one country’s bonds 
as a safe haven depends in part on how risky those of other countries are thought to be. 
Since the financial crisis and subsequent recession, another factor likely to have contributed 
to depressing yields is the sharp decline in investment, prompted by the deterioration in the 
outlook  and  heightened  uncertainty.  To  date  the  recovery  has  been  painfully  slow,  with 
negligible growth in the United Kingdom over the past year and a half. And though there is 
some variation in the pace of recovery across countries, in general growth has been weaker 
than  after  a  normal  cyclical  downturn.  In  part  that  reflects  the  fact  that  recoveries  after 
financial crises tend to be weaker and more drawn out as balance sheets are repaired, but 
also it probably reflects the exceptional uncertainty in the aftermath of the financial crisis. It is 
consequently hard to know when the animal spirits of businesses, and with it the propensity 
to invest, are likely to revive. 
Certainly  the  impact  of  QE  on  yields  should  ultimately  reverse  when  the  economic 
environment improves and we start to sell the gilts back to the market in order to withdraw 
the  present  exceptional  monetary  stimulus.  Unfortunately,  with  the  present  heightened 
uncertainty  associated  with  the  problems  in  the  euro  area,  the  likely  future  date  for  us  to 
commence selling gilts has receded somewhat. And if conditions do deteriorate significantly, 
we  may  need  to  re-start  the  programme  of  purchases.  Indeed,  as  the  minutes  released 
earlier  today  reveal,  the  decision  at  our  May  meeting  not  to  extend  the  programme  was 
already quite finely balanced. So, in conclusion, while there are reasons to expect yields to 
return towards historically more normal levels at some stage, it is difficult to know when that 
will be and how quickly it will occur. 
There is no doubt that this is a challenging time for pension funds and their sponsors. Low 
yields reduce the scope for harnessing the magic of compound interest to provide generous 
future pensions at a moderate current cost. It may be tempting to conclude that the current 
abnormally low yields are primarily a consequence of QE, and that the right approach is just 
to  look  through  the  associated  rise  in  deficits.  But  I  hope  that  what  I  have  said  today  has 
persuaded you that this may not, in fact, be the most prudent course to take. Pension funds 
and their sponsors may, I am afraid, have to contend with low yields for some considerable 
time yet. 
Thank you!

EFFECT OF DISCOUNTING BY A CORPORATE BOND RATE 
ANNEX:  
Accounting standard FRS17 dictates that pension fund liabilities should be discounted by an 
investment-grade (AA) corporate bond rate, rather than the gilt yield. During the period of the 
financial crisis that may, however, provide a misleading impression of the position of pension 
funds. Corporate bond yields carry a premium over gilt yields in part because of the risk of 
default. Discounting the flow of future pension liabilities by a corporate bond rate only makes 
sense  if  the  fund  is  no  longer  required  to  meet  those  liabilities  in  the  states  of  the  world 
where the bond defaults. But this is not generally the case: broadly speaking, the fund needs 
to meet its liabilities whatever happens. 
In normal times, this does not matter very much as the spread of investment-grade bonds 
over gilt yields is pretty small and does not vary very much. But during the peak of the crisis, 
the spread – even for investment-grade bonds – rose significantly (Chart A). Consequently, 
when standard accounting conventions are followed an additional factor needs to be added 
to  Charts  4  and  5,  reflecting  the  impact  of  changes  in  the  corporate  bond  spread.  That  is 
shown  by  the  mauve  bars  in  Charts  B  and  C  respectively;  the  profiles  of  the  other 
components of the deficit are unchanged. The main consequence of this is that the value of 
liabilities  falls  markedly  during  the  period  up  to  early  2009,  indeed  so  much  so  that  it 
counteracts the loss in asset value due to the fall in equity prices and pushes the fund into 
surplus.  But  it  would  be  unwise  for  the  sponsors  and  trustees  of  a  pension  fund  to  take 
comfort from this, given that the fall in the value of liabilities was merely an artefact of an 
increased probability of default on corporate bonds! 
Reworking the analysis of the text does not, however, affect the main conclusions regarding 
the  impact  of  QE.  Charts  D  and  E  are  the  equivalents  of  Charts  6  and  7,  showing  the 
calculated deficits with and without QE for a fully funded and a 30% underfunded pension 
scheme  respectively.  As  before,  QE  makes  little  difference  in  the  case  of  a  fully  funded 
scheme, but moves it towards deficit in the case of a significantly underfunded one.
