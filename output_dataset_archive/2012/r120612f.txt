Choongsoo Kim: Emerging Asia and global economic recovery 
Speech  by  Mr  Choongsoo  Kim,  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Korea,  to  the  Asia  Society,  New 
York, 18 April 2012. 
 Introduction 
Ms. and Mr. presidents, 
Distinguished members of the Asia Society 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
 I  am  very  pleased  to  have  this  opportunity  to  talk  today  before  distinguished  guests  and 
economic leaders from New York and people from all walks of life with a deep interest in the 
Korean economy.  
I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to Asia Society’s Co-Chairs, Henrietta H. 
Fore  and  Ronnie  C.  Chan,  and  all  of  those  involved  for  arranging  this  wonderful  occasion 
today.  
Founded in 1956, the Asia Society has worked as a mediator promoting exchanges  
and  cooperation  between  the  U.S.  and  Asian  countries  and  greatly  contributed  to  the 
remarkable economic development they have achieved today.  
I would like to praise most highly the impressive achievements of Asia Society not just in the 
economic  sector  but  across  the  entire  spectrum  of  culture,  arts  and  policy.    I  expect  Asia 
Society to play a greater role as an opinion leader for further development in Asia.  
Today, I will first give a brief introduction to the role of Asian emerging market economies 
that  have  become  the  center  of  the  world  economy  and  then  go  on  to  talk  about  the 
prospects  and  tasks  now  facing  the  Korean  economy,  which  has  been  assessed  to  have 
pulled out of the global financial crisis very quickly. 
Body  
During the course of overcoming the global financial crisis, the international community has 
concentrated  its  financial  resources  particularly  on  resolving  the  euro  area  sovereign  debt 
problems.  
Thanks to this effort, the international financial markets have been stabilized to a certain extent 
while the real sector economies remain still sluggish.

Given that the weakness of the real economy is at the base of all financial crises, maintaining 
growth  in  the  real  sector  is  more  important  than  securing  financial  stability  through 
short-sighted methods. 
Although financial regulatory reforms, such as Basel  Ⅲ, are underway as part of the efforts to 
overcome the crisis and prevent another, the highest priority is placed on leading world economic 
growth. 
In this respect, global financial markets are supposed to leave the ICU(Intensive Care Unit), and 
time is ripe to initiate a new strategy for further growth by attaining a global equilibrium. 
Asian  emerging  market  economies(EMEs)  have  shown  rapid  growth,  boosted  by  an 
export-oriented growth strategy, cheap high-quality labor, and the introduction of capital and 
technology from advanced countries, and so on. 
Unlike  advanced  economies(AEs),  Asian  EMEs,  in  particular,  have  been  growing  steadily 
since the global financial crisis.

The  Asian  economy  has  been  leading  global  economic  growth  since  the  1980s  and  its 
importance is expected to grow even further. 
Although having been temporarily sluggish due to the currency crisis in late 1990s, the GDP, 
trade volume and foreign reserves of the economy in this region have all been on a steady 
rise.

Especially, the rate of contribution of Asian EMEs to world GDP rose from 14% in 1970s to 
23% in 1980s, 34% in 1990s and 50% during the period for 2000~2011. The IMF forecasts 
the rate to remain at around 50% for the coming five years. 
However,  regarding  macro-financial  linkages,  the  international  community  has  so  far 
stressed  securing  financial  stability,  focusing  more  on  the  effect  of  finance  on  the 
macro-economy than on that of the macro-economy on finance. 
As  a  result,  the  injection  of  global  financial  resources  concentrated  poured  mainly  into 
Greece  and  other  heavily  indebted  countries  in  the  euro  area,  and  a  relatively  smaller 
proportion of these resources was allocated for growth promotion and job creation. 
In this respect, a true normalization of the current sovereign debt crises in the euro area can 
take place when individual European countries secure fiscal consolidation through a recovery 
of their respective growth trends.

At  another  point,  a  global  financial  crisis  originating  in  the  US  and  the  euro  area  and  the 
consequent policy responses in advanced countries have negative spillover effects on EMEs 
through the financial and real channels.  
The export momentum of EMEs weakened at the time of the financial crisis due to sluggish 
import demand in major countries amid the economic slowdown. 
 In  addition,  as  uncertainty  over  economic  conditions  mounted  due  to  the  global  financial 
market  unrest, 
turned  sour  and,  consequently, 
consumption and investment also weakened.

The role of the Asian economy is important for the recovery and sustainable growth of the 
world economy in the future and global financial resources, in this respect, should flow into 
EMEs with relatively high productivity and a heavy demand for capital. 
EMEs have been less affected by the crisis than advanced countries and are relatively sound 
fiscally. Therefore, they have sufficient latitude in macroeconomic policy to promote growth in the 
short-term.  
In addition, although Asian EMEs achieved high growth thanks to export-oriented strategies, 
intraregional  trade  continued  its  upward  trend  even  after  the  financial  crisis  as  countries 
turned to stable growth policies through domestic demand expansion.

Meanwhile,  since  urbanization  and  industrialization  are  proceeding  apace  in  Asian  EMEs 
such as China and India, there is a high demand for capital to build up infrastructures. What 
is  more  the  growth  rates  of  labor  productivity  are  higher  in  them  than  in  the  advanced 
countries.* 
The labor productivity growth rates in countries such as Korea (3.1%), India (4.1%) 
and China (9.4%) during 2000~08 greatly exceeded the average for OECD countries 
(1.6%).

For  its  part,  the  Korean  economy  has  developed  thanks  to  export-driven  growth  just  like 
other emerging Asian nations, and along the way it overcame crises through bold reforms. 
Especially, Korea’s trade volume had been over 1 trillion dollars in 2011, only nine countries have 
reached this trade volume.

Notably, Korea has won a reputation for having surmounted both the Asian currency crisis 
in the late 1990s and the recent global financial crisis faster than other countries around the 
world without retreating in liberalization; for example by introducing protectionist measures. 
During the Asian currency crisis, Korea carried out a strong restructuring of companies and 
financial businesses in a drive to improve the economy’s structural weaknesses. Also, Korea 
overcame the global financial crisis thanks largely to bold initiatives by the government and 
the central bank, such as the expansion of fiscal spending and swift policy rate cuts.  
So far, the remarkable development of the Korean economy has been attributable mainly to 
increases  in  external  trade,  and  in  this  sense  the  Korea-US  FTA,  which  came  into  effect 
recently, is expected to provide economic benefits to both nations. 
The effects of an FTA vary depending upon the counterparts’ economic conditions and their 
trade  structures.  But  for  Korea,  a  number  of  FTAs  have  served  to  spur  on  the  growth  of 
trade.  
(The Korea-EU FTA took effect in July 2011) Even though our overall exports to the EU have 
declined owing to the sovereign debt crisis, since the conclusion of the Korea-EU FTA, the 
exports of those items that benefit from the FTA have maintained high rates of growth.

The  Korea-US  FTA  is  believed  to  help  maintain  Korea’s  export  momentum  with  the  US 
through tariff reductions. 
In addition, the FTA is likely to boost brand recognition of Korean products that rank much 
lower in terms of technology and quality. 
From  a  medium-  and  long  term  perspective,  the  FTA  is  expected  to  heighten  the 
competitiveness of relatively weak service industries in Korea including the financial, legal, 
accounting and consulting sectors.

For the US, the FTA with Korea, the largest after NAFTA, is likely to help the US economy, 
which is already showing signs of improvement. 
The volume of US trade has increased sharply since it concluded the NAFTA with Canada 
and Mexico in 1994.

First of all, with greater accessibility to the Korean market, there are increasing opportunities 
for industries with a comparative advantage, such as the service industry.  
In  terms  of  production,  the  US  will  be  able  to  secure  a  new  supply  line  as  it  becomes 
possible to purchase high-quality Korean parts and components. 
Moreover, the US and the European companies can use Korea as a base for advancing into 
other East Asian countries as Korea trades on a large scale with China*, which has emerged 
as one of the G2 in the global economy.  
In terms of trade scale in 2011, China is Korea’s largest trading partner, and Korea is 
China’s third largest trading partner, following the US, and Japan.  
In  the  long  term,  I  hope  the  Korea-US  FTA  will  bring  positive  effects  on  growth  and 
employment  in  both  countries  through  the  expansion  of  exports  and  FDI  and  heightened 
industrial competitiveness.  
In addition, consumers are expected to benefit from a wider range of choice, and our bilateral 
relations are likely to be strengthened still further from a political perspective including the security 
dimension. 
In  the  short  term,  however,  difficulties  are  expected  for  the  industries  having  a  comparative 
disadvantage  in  both  nations  and  therefore  every  effort  should  be  made  to  encourage  the 
upgrading of their structure while showing consideration for the industrial fields concerned.

The  Korean  economy  is  expected  to  continue  its  solid  growth,  but  as  the  growth  rate  is 
anticipated  to  slow  down  over  the  medium  to  long  term,  it  is  vital  to  be  prepared  for  this 
situation.  
Even  in  the  face  of  heightened  economic  uncertainty  at  home  and  abroad,  the  Korean 
economy is forecast to grow at around 3 1/2% this year, led by domestic demand including 
facilities investment.  
Export momentum is expected to approach the pre-crisis level in the second half in line with 
global economic growth.

 However, downside risks are expected to remain high for some time affected by external risk 
factors  including  the  inflationary  pressure  from  oil  prices  and  possibility  of  euro  area

In the medium- to long-term, the growth rate is projected to decline due to a falling birth rate 
and ageing population.

To boost the future growth potential, the key is making the transition from input-led growth to 
productivity-led growth.  
As the increase in the productive population will be limited due to the low birth rate, it is more 
effective  to  make  efforts  to  increase  the  quality  of  human  resources  and  to  use  the  given 
labor resources more efficiently.

More  specifically,  it  is  necessary  to  induce  improvements  in  productivity  as  the  driver  of 
growth by enhancing that in the relatively laggard service industry and by increasing input 
quality through investment in R&D and innovative technologies.  
Concluding Remarks  
Distinguished members of the Asia Society 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
As I pointed out earlier, the Asian emerging market economies are leading world economic 
growth and they are sure to become the axis of the world economy. 
It is worth noting the attention Korea has been drawing from the international community for 
the way in which it overcame the Asian currency crisis and the global financial crisis and the 
country is expected to contribute to global economic growth in the coming years as well. 
However,  we  cannot  say  that  such  rapid  growth  will  last  in  Korea  and  other  Asian  EMEs, 
simply because they are currently exhibiting a remarkable economic performance.  
Since  the  Asian  growth  model  is  accompanied  by  several  constraints  such  as  the  heavy 
reliance  on  overseas  demand  and  production  factors,  the  derivative  use  of  advanced 
technology  and  a  low  degree  of  financial  market  development,  it  is  important  to  recognize 
these shortcomings and strive to improve them. 
For instance, due to their heavy external dependence, Asian EMEs were greatly affected by 
the  recent  financial  crisis,  even  though  it  originated  in  the  advanced  Western  economies 
such  as  the  U.S.  and  European  countries.  Hence,  we  need  to  seek  growth  based  on  the 
quickening of domestic demand.  
In  addition,  on  the  production  side,  we  need  to  make  efforts  to  expand  growth  potential 
through the improvement of productivity in the services sector, the shared growth between 
large and small corporations, and the development of new growth industries.  
Although the global financial crisis started in New York and then engulfed the euro area, it is 
important to prevent the contagion from the crisis from spreading to Asia if we are to have a 
recovery of the world economy and balanced development. 
To accomplish this goal, 
Firstly, we need strengthen policy coordination among individual countries in the absence of 
an organization with global jurisdiction that could manage global liquidity. 
Secondly, we should seek long-term and stable world economic growth through achievement 
of a global equilibrium by invigorating global gatherings such as G20 meetings, rather than 
making local equilibrium efforts to solve problems in individual regions.  
Lastly, we need to develop policy instruments and reform the financial system in global terms 
so that the world’s financial resources can flow into sectors with high productivity including 
the building-up of social infrastructure in Asian EMEs. 
Ms. and Mr. presidents, 
Distinguished members of the Asia Society 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
I would like to express my deep gratitude to all members of the audience here today for their 
close attention to the Asian economy as a whole and that of Korea in particular. 
Drawing my remarks to a close, I hope that as true friends of Korea you will not hesitate to 
give your suggestions and advice about the future of the Korean economy. 
Thank you again for listening so attentively.
