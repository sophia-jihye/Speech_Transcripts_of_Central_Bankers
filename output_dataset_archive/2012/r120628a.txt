Rodrigo Vergara: Chile’s latest Monetary Policy Report and Financial 
Stability Report 
Presentation by Mr Rodrigo Vergara, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, of the Monetary 
Policy  Report  and  the  Financial  Stability  Report,  before  the  Finance  Commission  of  the 
Honorable Senate of the Republic, Santiago de Chile, 18 June 2012.

 Introduction 
Mr.  President  of  the  Finance  Commission  of  the  Senate,  Senator  José  García,  senators 
members of this Commission, ladies, gentlemen. 
I am grateful for your invitation to the Board of the Central Bank of Chile to share our views 
on  recent  macroeconomic  and  financial  developments,  prospects  and  implications  for 
monetary and financial policy making. These views are contained in detail in our Monetary 
Policy Report of June 2012 and our Financial Stability Report of the first half of 2012. 
For several quarters now the world economy has been suffering constant swings. We have 
said time and again that the causes and consequences of the financial crisis of 2008 are yet 
to  be  resolved.  Thanks  to  a  combination  of  economic  policy  responses  and  its  healthy 
economies and financial systems, the emerging world succeeded in mitigating its effects and 
resuming a growth trajectory. But the developed world, especially the Eurozone, has been 
unable to regain its strength. We have seen continuing tensions in world financial markets, 
doubts  over  the  future  behavior  of  the  global  economy,  together  with  risks  appearing, 
disappearing  and  reappearing  again.  As  time  has  passed,  with  no  evident  signs  of 
improvement in these economies’ outlook, problems have been exacerbated. Weak growth 
and  the  need  for  households,  firms,  banks  and  governments  to  reduce  their  debts,  have 
created  a  vicious  circle  that  hampers  the  solution  to  the  macroeconomic  and  financial 
problems facing the advanced economies. 
Certainly, the case of the United States is different from the case of the Eurozone, because 
their  institutions  and  the  way  they  solve  their  internal  imbalances  are  different.  In  the 
Eurozone,  the  situation  of  some  economies  is  hardly  sustainable.  However,  there  are 
differences. While the economic block as a whole has a practically balanced current account, 
it varies from one country to the next. Germany has kept excess savings for several years, 
which  has  resulted  in  a  current  account  surplus,  while  many  peripheral  countries  post  a 
deficit (figure i). Exchange rate and wage rigidities do not help resolve the imbalances within 
the  region. Overall,  in  the  past few  quarters  part  of  the  necessary  adjustments  have  been 
taking place. Germany has increased imports from peripheral Europe, and has cut down its 
exports to the same countries. Solving the imbalances of the Eurozone will take time and it 
will not be easy. Any solution will be costly, without a doubt. 
The  events  of  recent  weeks  have  confirmed  that  the  crisis  is  far  from  over  and  that 
imbalances  persist  in  the  developed  world  that  keep  financial  markets  under  stress.  The 
reappearance  of  risks  and  the  tensions  we  have  seen  are  a  reflection  of  that,  and  have 
deepened the differences between the behavior of the world economy and our own (table 1). 
Thus, today we are again facing significant risks. After some improvement in the first quarter 
of  the  year,  conditions  in  the  Eurozone  relapsed  and  their  financial  markets  have 
experienced tensions in the levels of last December or worse. The baseline scenario of our 
March  Monetary  Policy  Report  assumed  that  temporary,  limited  frictions  would  occur, 
although it warned about existing risks. In recent months those risks have resurfaced. There

first  quarter,  y-o-y  GDP  growth  exceeded  March’s 
is  new  debate  about  a  possible  disorderly  resolution  of  the  Eurozone  crisis.  Several 
economies are questioning the political support to the fiscal austerity measures. Economic 
and  financial  conditions  in  Spain  have  worsened  further  and  its  risk  premium  is  in  record 
highs, despite the announced capitalization of its banking industry. In addition, there are still 
doubts whether other countries will be needing similar action. 
Financial  markets  respond  with  increased  risk  premiums  and  greater  appetite  for  safer 
assets. Stock prices are falling across the board, volatility is up, the dollar has appreciated 
again and the interest rates of government bonds from economies perceived as safe have 
dropped to record lows. At the same time, commodity prices have fallen sharply, especially 
oil. As in late 2011, the main effects of these tensions in emerging economies, aside from 
lower commodity prices, have been the depreciation of their currencies, fallen stock prices 
and increased risk premiums on their external bonds. Chile has not been spared, although as 
of  the  statistical  closing  of  these  Reports  the  effects  have  been  limited.  Compared  with 
March, the peso/dollar parity has depreciated somewhat below 5 percent; the stock market, 
as  measured  by  the  selected  price index  IPSA  in  pesos,  has  lost  over  7  percent,  and  the 
sovereign  premiums  of  Chilean  CDS  have  risen  nearly  40  basis  points.  Money  markets, 
meanwhile, have operated normally. 
In contrast with the developed world, in Chile domestic output and demand are still strong. In 
the 
in 
quarter-to-quarter terms it lost strength with respect to late 2011 and grew according to trend. 
Inflation has been lower than expected, which, combined with the drop in international fuel 
prices, has reduced the risks for its short-term evolution. In general, medium-term inflationary 
risks are still latent because domestic markets remain tight. 
In this context, the Board has kept the monetary policy interest rate (MPR) at 5 percent since 
January,  and  has  conditioned  its  future  movements  to  the  implications  of  domestic  and 
external conditions on the inflation outlook. 
Chile is on a healthy position to confront further deterioration of the global scenario. We have 
built  economic  institutions  that  allow  us  to  reach  substantial  levels  of  growth,  and  the 
necessary tools to mitigate any adverse shocks facing our economy. But we are not immune. 
In  the  globalized  world  of  today,  any  change  in  conditions  is  rapidly  propagated  to  other 
economies. The movements in financial markets that I mentioned a while ago are proof of 
this.  Trying  to  isolate  ourselves  from  the  rest  of  the  world  would  be  not  only  useless,  but 
harmful in the long run. The important thing is for us to have the capacity to shield ourselves 
from  negative  events  and,  when  necessary,  to  take  action  to  reduce  their  effects  on  our 
country. We already did so when the Lehman Brothers crisis hit in 2008. We couldn’t prevent 
the  global  recession  from  affecting  our  economy,  but  we  did  succeed  in  fostering  a  fast, 
sustainable recovery from 2009 onwards. 
In any case, our domestic macroeconomic situation has varied in these four years. Today, 
inflation  is  at  3  percent,  GDP  is  growing  at  near-trend  rates  and  the  MPR  is  in  a  neutral 
range. This provides room to respond with monetary policy if necessary, although the timing 
and magnitude of the measures will have to be evaluated with special prudence and in light 
of  the  actual  effects  of  external  developments  on  our  economy.  Our  financial  system, 
meanwhile,  has  been  solid  and  resilient  to  sudden  changes  in  the  international  economy. 
The  Board  of  the  Central  Bank  is  firmly  determined  to  adopt  any  measures  needed  to 
mitigate the adverse effects of a worsened external scenario, but it also must be careful not 
to allow medium-term inflationary risks to end up triggering an unwanted increase in inflation. 
In the baseline scenario that we believe to be the most likely, the world economy will remain 
weak  and  will  give  us  less  impulse  than  we  expected  a  few  months  ago.  Although  the 
Chilean economy will be affected, it will continue to perform well. Inflation will stay around 
3 percent.  But  the  external  risks  facing  said  baseline  scenario  are  significant.  Let  me  now 
look into this setting in more detail, examining the risks we have identified in our Monetary 
Policy Report and our Financial Stability Report.

Macroeconomic scenario 
As  I  just  said,  the  external  impulse  on  the  Chilean  economy  in  the  next  two  years  will  be 
weaker than forecast in March. The poor performance of the developed world – for several 
quarters  already  –  is  being  compounded  with  early  signs  of  weakness  in  emerging 
economies, thus exacerbating the risks coming from abroad. 
I  want  to  begin  by  the  developed  world.  In  the  Eurozone,  the  new  financial  tensions  have 
tightened credit constraints, while ongoing fiscal measures will not contribute to boost growth 
in  the  near  term.  The  recession  foreseen  for  the  region  this  year  will  be  deeper  than 
previously estimated. 
The other developed economies will grow slowly. The U.S. will fall short of March forecasts, 
due to the slow recovery of its labor market, a real-estate sector that is still unable to leave 
the subprime crisis behind, a household deleveraging process that continues its course, and 
little additional room to apply any measures to boost growth. 
But, compared to March, the biggest difference in terms of world growth lies in the emerging 
world.  In  contrast  with  2011,  the  main  emerging  economies  have  lost  dynamism.  Some 
indicators for China suggest that the decline in its growth rate will be sharper than forecast in 
March. This has prompted the adoption of more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, 
and India has followed suit. The rest of emerging Asia is feeling the effects of lower growth in 
China, the U.S. and Europe in its exports and its manufacturing industry. In Latin America, 
although  there  is  more  heterogeneity,  the  poor  performance  of  Brazil  in  the  first  quarter 
stands  out.  Other  economies,  like  Mexico,  Peru,  Colombia  and  Chile  remain  strong, 
sustained  by  their  domestic  demands.  This  world  scenario  of  weaker  economies  and 
reduced  inflationary  pressures  due  to  the  lower  oil  price  has  triggered  a  relaxation  of 
monetary policies of several emerging economies. 
The baseline scenario forecasts that Chile’s trading partners will grow 3.6 and 3.9 percent in 
2012 and 2013, respectively, a little less than was foreseen in the previous Monetary Policy 
Report. This will also result in lower prices for copper and oil than were expected in March. In 
summary, the baseline scenario considers a reduced external impulse associated to slower 
world  growth  and  somewhat  tightened  external  financing  conditions.  It  also  considers  that 
new stress episodes will occur in external financial markets (table 2). As has been observed 
in  recent  months,  these  events  can  be  triggered  by  negative  news  coming  from  the  fiscal 
accounts, economic growth and the banking situation in the Eurozone.  
The feeble external outlook contrasts with the performance of Chile’s domestic demand and 
output  in  the  last  few  quarters.  In  the  first  quarter  of  this  year,  GDP  grew  5.6  percent, 
exceeding  forecasts  in  the  March  Monetary  Policy  Report.  In  quarter-on-quarter  terms,  it 
expanded at trend rates, leading the Board to estimate that output gaps are still narrow. This 
view is based on the fact that, although the labor market continues to show signs of being 
tight,  these  signs  have  not  intensified:  employment  has  reduced  its  rate  of  expansion,  the 
unemployment rate has settled at low levels and y-o-y growth in wages, while still strong, has 
moderated lately. In the first quarter, domestic demand grew somewhat less than output, but 
private consumption and investment are still robust. 
Inflation  has  behaved  favorably  in  the  past  few  months,  below  March’s  forecasts.  This, 
combined  with  oil  prices  falling  in  external  markets,  has  reduced  the  risks  that  were 
envisioned  then  for  its  short-term  trajectory.  Still,  the  services  component  of  inflation 
continues to be the largest contributor to its increase, so medium-term risks remain present, 
due  to  the  closing  of  output  gaps  and  the  tight  labor  market  (figure  2).  Market  inflation 
expectations  have  moderated  for  the  short  term  and  remain  around  3  percent  over  the 
projection horizon. 
The baseline scenario foresees GDP growing this year between 4 and 5 percent, which is 
the  same  range  forecast  in  March.  Although  the  economy  outgrew  forecasts  in  the  first 
quarter, the worsened external conditions will result in output slowing down more deeply than 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

forecast in March. Still, GDP growth will not drift substantially away from the trend, which the 
Board estimates at 5 percent. 
This projection also considers that y-o-y growth in consumption will moderate further, in line 
with decelerating labor income and less expansionary lending conditions than some months 
ago. Interest rates on consumer loans have risen lately, coinciding with a decline in the y-o-y 
growth  of  these  credits.  In  addition,  the  Survey  on  Lending  Conditions  of  the  first  quarter 
revealed greater constraints in the supply of consumer loans by some financial institutions. 
Demand for consumer loans continued to rise, according to this survey. 
For  investment,  the  more  persistent  construction  and  infrastructure  component  –  largely 
associated  to  the  execution  of  mining  and  energy  projects  –  suggests  that  it  will  remain 
strong  in  the  coming  quarters.  Accordingly,  measured  in  real  terms,  it  will  amount  to 
26.9 percent of GDP in 2012, up from 26.2 percent of GDP in 2011. 
The  effects  of  the  worsened  external  scenario  will  be  visible  mainly  in  inventories.  The 
baseline scenario estimates that in 2012 inventories as a percentage of GDP will vary less 
than they did in 2011, reflecting the inventory adjustments that enterprises will be carrying 
out because of the uncertainty coming from abroad. Consumption and investment will also 
be partly affected by the worsened global conditions, but the main determinants will be the 
aforesaid factors. All these elements combined depict a scenario for 2012 where domestic 
demand grows less than in 2011, although still faster than output. 
The  baseline  scenario  foresees  the  current  account  of  the  balance  of  payments  posting  a 
deficit of 3.1 percent of GDP this year, that is, bigger than in 2011, but somewhat smaller 
than forecast in March. Despite the lower price assumed for copper and the weak domestic 
demand,  the  expected  adjustment  in  domestic  demand  plus  the  drop  in  the  oil  price  are 
behind this smaller deficit (table 3). 
The Board estimates that y-o-y CPI and core inflation will continue to hover around the target 
until the end of the projection horizon, this time the second quarter of 2014 (figure 3). This 
trajectory assumes that wages will be adjusted to reflect productivity and the inflation target. 
As  a  working  assumption,  the  real  exchange  rate  is  assumed  to  remain  fairly  unchanged, 
because  it  is  estimated  to  be  now  within  the  range  believed  to  be  consistent  with  its 
long-term  fundamentals.  Finally,  the  baseline scenario  also uses  as a working  assumption 
that, over the short term, the MPR will be stable. 
The baseline scenario reflects those events that are believed to be the most likely with the 
information at hand at the statistical closing of the Report. There are risk scenarios, however, 
which,  if  materialized,  may  reshape  the  macroeconomic  environment  –  in  some  cases, 
significantly – and, therefore, may alter the course of monetary policy. On this opportunity, 
having  evaluated  the  alternative  scenarios,  the  Board  estimates  that  the  risk  balance  is 
downward biased for output, and unbiased for inflation. 
The  greater  risk  originates  abroad,  because  of  the  situation  in  the  Eurozone.  This  is  very 
complex  and  the  developments  of  recent  months  have  revived  the  possibility  of  more 
extreme scenarios. Most importantly, economic and financial problems in the region could be 
worked out in a costly and disorderly manner, for example with Greece leaving the monetary 
union.  Despite  its  small  size  within  the  Eurozone,  such  an  outcome  could  inflict  severe 
damage  on  the  rest  of  the  world  if  there  is  contagion  to  bigger  European  economies.  The 
macroeconomic and financial situation of Spain continues to spur doubts, as reflected in the 
steady  increase  in  its  risk  premiums.  The  lack  of  clarity  about  the  capitalization  plan 
announced for the Spanish banking industry, its difficulties to meet the fiscal targets given 
the gloomy growth outlook and its impact on its sovereign debt are still cause for concern. 
Similarly, apprehensions have increased about other countries in the region, such as Italy, 
because of the bulk of its public debt and its slow growth. The coupling of risk premiums in 
Spain, Italy and France provides evidence of this risk. Also possible is a reversal of current 
tensions,  for  instance  if  there  are  agreements  favoring  compliance  with  the  adjustment 
measures  agreed  or  new  announcements  of  support  by  economic  authorities  in  the  zone, 
4

that  could  buy  time  to  advance  in  the  necessary  structural  changes.  The  outcome  of 
yesterday’s elections in Greece where the winner was the political option whose program is 
more in line with the country staying in the Eurozone, mitigates somewhat the eventuality of 
a Greek default triggering a crisis in the rest of the Eurozone. However, it is still premature to 
draw any conclusions. But undoubtedly the coming days will bring important news and we 
must  be  watchful  of  its  effects  on  our  economy.  Additionally,  other  events  will  bring  new 
information. More detail about the capitalization plan of Spain’s banks and the EC meeting 
later in the month may shed some light on new bailout measures. 
Other risks have to do with world growth prospects beyond the Eurozone. Doubts persist in 
the U.S. about how the transition to a sustainable medium- and long-term debt trajectory will 
proceed.  Special  attention  is  due  to  the  possibility  that  political  difficulties  to  reach 
agreements  on  the  fiscal  front  could  trigger  the  automatic  adjustments  foreseen  towards 
2013,  hurting  its  GDP  growth.  In  the  emerging  world,  a  sharper  and/or  longer  Chinese 
slowdown  than  foreseen  in  the  baseline  scenario  cannot  be  ruled  out,  hindering  growth  in 
other  economies  due  to  its  weight  in  the  global  economy,  and  affecting  commodity  prices 
significantly. 
Domestically, as aforesaid, medium-term risks for inflation are still present. The growth rate 
of domestic demand and output has dropped, albeit not as fast as expected. Although the 
Board estimates that output gaps have not narrowed further, if output again takes up a more 
dynamic path, there can be pressures pushing inflation up and demanding a monetary policy 
response. 
Domestic  demand  has  outgrown  GDP  in  the  last  two  years,  thus  widening  the  current 
account  deficit.  Households’  saving  is  low  compared  with  earlier  years,  while  corporate 
savings have decreased in the past year and investment is in record-high levels. If domestic 
demand becomes more dynamic, it could amplify the current account deficit. This could be 
risky in a scenario of weak world growth. 
As  noted  in  our  Financial  Stability  Report,  aggregate  solvency  and  liquidity  of  the  Chilean 
economy remains stable. This is important, considering that banks’ and enterprises’ access 
to  external  credit  could  be  hampered  by  a  further  deterioration  of  the  global  financial 
environment. In any case, and despite the impact of external volatility on the prices of some 
assets, financial markets have operated normally. In this context, I would like to highlight the 
need  to  continue  advancing  in  initiatives  to  strengthen  our  regulatory  and  supervisory 
framework. One such case is the bill to reform insurance companies currently being debated 
in Congress. 
The banks’ solvency and liquidity indexes have been stable in the first half. In a context of 
good  rents,  core  capital  has  hovered  around  10  percent  while  regulatory  capital  –  as 
measured  through  risk-weighted  assets  –  around  14  percent.  Meanwhile,  since  the  last 
Financial Stability Report the banking industry has increased its long-term debt certificates, 
and  some  medium-sized  banks  have  pursued  strategies  to  attract  retail  deposits.  Another 
favorable development is the greater diversification of banks into different types of credit from 
abroad. Also worth noting is the hoarding of liquid assets in foreign currency. The stress tests 
presented  in  our  Financial  Stability  Report  show  that  the  banking  industry’s  current 
capitalization levels allow it to cushion an episode characterized by a GDP slowdown, higher 
financing  costs  in  local  currency  and  an  exchange  rate  depreciation  associated  with  the 
materialization of the external risk scenario. 
As  for  household  debt,  it  should  be  noted  that,  on  aggregate,  borrowing  has  increased  in 
tandem  with  disposable  income.  This  has  translated  into  fairly  stable  aggregate  debt 
indicators, whether comparing the debt level or financial burden with disposable income or 
the  wage  mass.  Corporate  debt  shows  a  similar  pattern,  increasing  along  with  economic 
activity, without any widespread deterioration of financial indicators. 
Thus, it is our view that the Chilean financial system has not suffered any material increase 
of its systemic vulnerabilities.

However, our Financial Stability Report also identifies some elements that might be sources 
of risk and that must be closely monitored. The construction and real estate sector has been 
strong lately. Activity in the real estate market has had stronger sales as a counterpart, for 
both  housing  and  commercial  use.  While  the  vacancy  rate  in  the  commercial  sector  has 
remained  low,  the  expected  substantial  expansion  of  supply  and  its  inertia,  especially  in 
top-quality  offices,  is  one  factor  that  must  be  monitored  closely  given  the  risk  scenarios 
facing  economic  activity.  The  evaluation  of  any  new  project  should  take  this  element  into 
consideration. 
In the same token, aggregate housing prices have evolved in line with the economy’s level of 
interest  rates  and  income.  However,  at  some  higher-priced  districts,  prices  are  still 
outgrowing their historic trends, possibly due to limited land available. It is important to keep 
in  mind  that  the  materialization  of  negative  risk  scenarios  could  lead  to  a  breakdown  in 
current price trends. The potential implications of this are price adjustments influencing the 
returns of executed projects and, additionally, the collaterals backing mortgage loans. 
With  respect  to  household  debt,  two  factors  deserve  careful  attention.  One  is  its  rate  of 
expansion. This, because if it continues to grow at the present rates, the debt and financial 
burden of households could rise substantially if a negative risk scenario materializes. In this 
context,  having  a  consolidated  data  base  is  particularly  important,  to  allow  proper  risk 
administration by suppliers and enhance the monitoring capacity of supervisors. 
The  second  factor  is  the  behavior  of  credit-risk  indicators.  Although  moderately,  since 
mid-2011  there  have  been  increases  in  banks’  non-performing  consumer  loans  and  in 
delinquency  rates  of  commercial  stores  (figure  4).  This  element,  as  well  as  the  sustained 
growth  of  credit-card  financing  and  car  loans  should  also  be  taken  into  account  when 
evaluating the credit risk of households. 
Medium-sized,  retail,  and  investment  banks  are  persistently  dependent  on  institutional 
financing sources. Besides, and despite the smaller relative weight of foreign banks in the 
external debt of local banks, the reduction in credits from banks based in peripheral Europe 
has resulted in greater concentration in banks from abroad. 
The complexity of today’s scenario calls for prudent monetary policy making and careful risk 
administration, in order to be prepared to deal with significant changes in the macroeconomic 
scenario. The international economy’s situation is worrisome and a further worsening could 
have major effects in Chile. Domestically, some risks persist relating to inflation, and it is the 
Central Bank’s task to be vigilant. The Board monitors closely the evolution of the external 
and internal macroeconomic scenario and its consequences on inflation, and it reaffirms its 
commitment  to  conduct  monetary  policy  in  a  way  such  that  projected  inflation  stands  at 
3 percent in the policy horizon. 
Allow me some final remarks. 
Concluding remarks 
As  has  happened  often  in  the  past  several  years,  our  presentation  of  these  Reports 
coincides with increased global financial stress and poses important challenges. 
The  short-term  inflationary  risks  we  identified  in  March  have  lessened,  although  for  the 
medium term they are still present. Our immediate challenge, however, is dealing in the best 
way  possible  with  any  effects  from  the  external  crisis  on  our  economy.  The  Board  of  the 
Central  Bank  is  willing  to  adopt  whatever  measure  it  deems  necessary  if  more  adverse 
scenarios occur. Events abroad are being monitored with special attention. For the moment, 
however,  we  estimate  that  worst-case  scenarios  are  possible  but  not  the  most  likely, 
although  they  are  more  likely  now  than  before.  In  our  projections  we  use  as  a  working 
assumption that, in the short term, the monetary policy rate will remain stable. A change in 
scenery will certainly lead to a change in decisions. As I said before, the Board – present in 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
this  session  –  monitors  macroeconomic  conditions  closely  and  will  act  promptly  whenever 
said  changes  warrant  reorienting  our  monetary  policy  or  using  other  tools  at  our  disposal. 
There is the room and the will to do so. 
Let me share with you some thoughts about what I have perceived at the meetings I have 
held  in  recent  months  with  monetary  authorities  around  the  world.  The  central  bank 
governors  of  developed  economies,  plus  some  from  emerging  markets,  get  together  once 
every  two  months  to  share  our  views  on  the  global  economic  and  financial  situation.  Two 
things have called my attention in the three meetings I have attended since I assumed as the 
governor  of  the  CBC.  On  the  one  hand,  the  severity  and  gravity  of  the  situation  of  some 
developed countries. Being so distant geographically from the main financial centers of the 
world, in Chile we often fail to grasp in full dimension the hardships facing some economies 
that interact with us. These meetings allow us to see firsthand these situations and feel their 
true magnitude. On the other, I am amazed by the high prestige that the Chilean economy 
enjoys in these same arenas. It is clearly set apart from others, because of its strength, its 
sound macroeconomic administration and the efficacy of its institutions. Of course this makes 
us confident as it gives us more and better tools to confront possible shocks coming from 
abroad. 
Our responsibility is twofold. On the one hand, is to keep inflation low and stable, to help in 
achieving sustainable growth. On the other hand, is to contribute with our powers to identify 
and  address  the  risks  threatening  the  normal  functioning  of  our  financial  system.  This 
certainly helps create an environment that facilitates economic growth and the population’s 
welfare. This is the main contribution that our institution can make to the development of our 
country, and the Board of the Central Bank of Chile is firmly committed to fulfilling this role. 
Thank you.
