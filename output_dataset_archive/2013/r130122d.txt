K C Chakrabarty: The magical world of mathematics – the charm, 
challenges and career prospects 
Address  by  Dr  K  C  Chakrabarty,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India,  at 
“Mathemight”, a conference organized by the Department of Mathematics of the Vivekanand 
Education Society’s College of Arts, Science & Commerce, Mumbai, 18 January 2013.

Introduction 
1. 
Dr.  Rajeeva  Karandikar,  Director,  Chennai  Mathematical  Institute;  Dr.  Mrs.  J.K. 
Phadnis, Principal of the VES College of Arts, Science and Commerce; Prof. Amiya Kumar 
Pani,  Chair  Professor,  Department  of  Mathematics,  IIT  Bombay;  Mrs.  Dipta  Dasgupta, 
Convener of this conference aptly titled “Mathemight”, faculty members; other distinguished 
speakers and student participants; ladies and gentlemen. I am delighted to be here today in 
the  midst  of  eminent  scholars  and  students  of  mathematics.  The  Vivekananda  Education 
Society  has  successfully  completed  fifty  years  in  its  “Pursuit  of  Excellence  in  Higher 
Education” and I congratulate the Society on this achievement. I understand that the Society 
is  organizing  frontline  seminars  and  conferences  for  our  younger  generation  to  sow  the 
seeds of curiosity and to enhance their knowledge base. You may recall that this year, we 
are  celebrating  the  150th  birth  anniversary  of  Swami  Vivekananda,  one  of  the  greatest 
spiritual leaders of India. He once observed: “you know how many sciences had their origin 
in India. Mathematics began there. You are even today counting 1, 2, 3, etc. to zero, after 
Sanskrit figures, and you all know that algebra also originated in India”. It is, therefore, very 
appropriate  that  the  college,  which  is  named  after  Swami  Vivekananda,  is  organizing  this 
conference  on  Mathematics  coinciding  with 
the  150th  birth  anniversary  of  Swami 
Vivekananda.  
This conference is most appropriately timed for several reasons. First, the year 2013 
2. 
has been designated by the International Mathematical Union as The Year of Mathematics of 
Planet  Earth.  Second,  we  have  recently  celebrated  the  125th  birth  anniversary  of  one  of 
India’s  greatest  mathematics  geniuses,  Srinivasa  Ramanujan  (1887–1920).  Ramanujan’s 
true legacy is the demonstration of how a humble, untutored village boy, with sheer passion, 
inspiration and inherent talent, rose to become one of the world’s greatest mathematicians. 
From this perspective, this conference is perfectly positioned to create awareness amongst 
the undergraduates about the collaborative nature of mathematics, technology, commerce, 
science  and  social  sciences  and  the  vast  opportunities  that  mathematics  can  offer.  In  this 
background, I plan to talk briefly about the attractions of mathematics, the need for studying 
mathematics, its applications, the challenges in mastering the subject, prospects it holds for 
those who pursue the discipline and about the risk of misusing mathematics.

What is Mathematics? 
The word itself comes from Greek “Mathema” meaning knowledge, study, learning. 
There seems to be no consensus among professionals on the issue of defining what 
Mathematics  is.  In  fact,  you  will  be  surprised  that  there  is  even  no  consensus  on 
whether it is an art or a science. 
Definition-wise, there are three sets of definition that I am aware of:

Logicist: Benjamin Pierce’s “the science that draws necessary conclusions”, 
or Russell’s “all mathematics is symbolic logic”. 
Intuitionist:  From  the  philosophy  of  Brouwer  “Mathematics  is  the  mental 
activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other”. 
Formalist:  Identifying  mathematics  with  all  its  symbols  and  the  rules  for 
operating on them

Mathematics  is,  perhaps,  the  oldest  of  sciences  that  has  existed,  developed  and 
matured in either explicit or in latent form over thousands of years. The concept of numbers 
was  not  only  known  to  prehistoric  man  but  may  also  be  known  to  animals.  For  example, 
when  lions  hear  a  neighboring  pride  roaring,  they  calculate  how  many  lions  are  roaring 
compared to the number of lions in their own pride. If there are more lions in their own pride, 
or the numbers are equal, or the other pride outnumbers them by up to three to one, they will 
always roar back. If the other pride outnumbers them by more than three to one, they stay 
quiet. Most animals would know the difference between a bowl containing 4 apples and one 
with  8  apples  or  even  the  fact  that  there  is  something  common  between  4  apples  and 
4 oranges. 
5. 
The beauty and charm of mathematics has lured, intrigued and inspired countless 
geniuses across the globe to spend sleepless nights in the hope of unraveling its mysteries. 
Why have the seekers of knowledge been attracted to mathematics from time immemorial? I 
feel the primary charm of mathematics is that it is both interesting and, if you can crack its 
intricacies,  enjoyable.  People  like  its  challenge,  its  clarity,  and  the  fact  that  in  solving 
problems of mathematics you know when you are right. The study of mathematics can satisfy 
a wide range of interests and abilities. It helps develop one’s imagination and aids in building 
a clear and logical thought process.  
6. 
Let  me  share  with  you  an  example  to  illustrate  the  charm  of  mathematics.  It  is  a 
well-known  story  about  Ramanujan  and  his  mentor,  another  famous  mathematician,  Prof. 
G. H. Hardy, who recognized his immense talent and took him to England. At one point of 
time, Ramanujan was unwell and lying in an England hospital where Hardy had gone to visit 
him.  Hardy  told  him  that  he  came  in  a  taxi,  the  number  plate  of  which  had  a  most 
uninteresting number 1729. Ramanujan was very quick in his reply. He said it was one of the 
most interesting numbers that one came across. It is the smallest positive integer, which can 
be written as the sum of two cubes in two different ways, viz., (12)3 + (1)3 and (10)3 + (9)3.  
7. 
Prof.  C.  R.  Rao,  one  of  the  most  outstanding  mathematicians  in  the  world,  once 
said,  “All  sciences  are,  in  the  abstract,  mathematics”,  which  aptly  captures  the  immense 
contribution  of  mathematics 
the  development  of  other  sciences.  Perhaps, 
recognizing this centuries ago, Gauss termed Mathematics as the “Queen of all Sciences”.

Why study mathematics? 
8. 
Just type the words “why study mathematics” in a Google search and you will get 
around 67 million results – these many people, institutes or articles trying to see the benefits 
of  studying  mathematics.  Study  of  Mathematics  is  extremely  important  for  many  reasons. 
Maths surrounds us in many ways as we go about our everyday life. Let me now tell you why 
you should study mathematics:  
a. 
Mathematics  makes  life  simple  by  quantification.  Numbers,  units  and  dimensions 
help  in  comprehending  things  better  and  lead  to  precision  and  certainty  in 
measurement and expression.  
It  helps  formulate  as  well  as  establish  measurement  standards  in  respect  of 
observable phenomena. 
Take some simple examples:  
b.

b. 
“Ajay is tall or Ajay is strong” – What do you make of such statements. It will make 
sense  when  we  compare  with  some  benchmark  or  measure  and  quantify  it.  Only 
then do we know what is tall or what is strong. Then things become precise. 
Suppose your parents tell you, “You have to study very hard” or “you have to study 
very very hard” – do these sentences make much sense? Yes, they certainly make. 
But,  I  am  sure,  “you  have  to  get  80%  marks”  is  something  which  will  give  you 
greater focus as the goal is unambiguously stated.  
Mathematical  concepts  like  measurement,  which  were  applicable  earlier  only  to  physical 
sciences, are now being made use of in social as well as biological sciences too. 
10. 
Turning  to  more  formal  discussion,  one  of  the  important  features  of  a  scientific 
investigation  is  its  fixation  with  putting  numbers  to  things,  by  quantification  using 
mathematical  formulae.  Often,  scientific  work  is  judged  more  by  the  quality  of  its 
mathematics than by its empirical content. Let me quote what James Clerk Maxwell said “All 
the  mathematical  sciences  are  founded  on  relations  between  physical  laws  and  laws  of 
numbers,  so  that  the  aim  of  exact  science  is  to  reduce  the  problems  of  nature  to  the 
determination of quantities by operations with numbers”. 
11. 
(i) 
Let me cite some classical examples. 
First  one  relates  to  modeling  of  astronomical  data,  whereby  you  may  recall  how 
logarithmic  tables  were  found  useful  for  analyzing  centuries  of  astronomical 
observations collated by Tyco Brahe and put to use by Johannes Kepler to form the 
basic laws of Planetary motion in the early 1600s. Kepler’s three laws of planetary 
motion are: (i) The path of the planets about the sun is elliptical in shape, with the 
center of the sun being located at one focus (The Law of Ellipses). (ii) An imaginary 
line drawn from the center of the sun to the center of the planet will sweep out equal 
areas in equal intervals of time (The Law of Equal Areas) and (iii) The ratio of the 
squares of the periods of any two planets is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their 
average  distances  from  the  sun.  (The  Law  of  Harmonies).  It  is  the  third  law  that 
involves difficult exponentiation of squares and cubes, which does not yield easily to 
the  naked  eye  when  the  actual  data  are  observed.  Many  would  know  how  later 
Newton’s universal law of gravitation could be found equivalent to Kepler’s laws of 
planetary motion. But it is also no less magical that Kepler’s Third Law of planetary 
motion can actually be traced back to Napier’s invention of logarithms (1614), which 
is supposed to be the main force to derive the postulate about the third law almost 
twelve years after the establishment of the first two laws.  
Second, I would like to cite the Mendel’s law of segregation of Hereditary Characters 
(1866), which was rediscovered at the beginning of the last century, without which, 
Darwin’s theory of evolution could not be explained statistically. Here, I would also 
like to underscore that statistics is a major branch of mathematical science but with 
a  difference.  Math  seems  to  be  providing  rigorous  base  for  deterministic,  logical 
framework of establishing truth whereas statistics comes out of measurements and 
observations with errors.  
The  third  one  is  the  now  well-known  work  of  the  French  Mathematician,  Louis 
Bachelier on the study of finance, which is treated historically as the first of its kind. 
His Ph. D thesis on the Theory of Speculation (1900) is credited with being the first 
such  work  on  the  phenomenon  of  Brownian  Motion  that  was,  much  later,  put  into 
use to evaluate stock options.  
In  modern  times,  majority  of  the  financial  mathematics  driven  formulae  behind 
pricing of different financial assets are testimony to how they can be both used and 
abused if not verified rigorously based on real life data.

The above examples relate to close approximation to reality  with the help of mathematics, 
but based on well-established quantifications and measurement standards.

Whether we deal with mechanical, electrical or electronic objects such as the light, 
fan,  TV,  car,  bicycle  or  computers  –  understanding  their  functioning  calls  for  use  of 
mathematics. We all perform tasks ranging from simple arithmetic to complex computations 
as we deal with money, deposits, insurance, income tax, and so on. Today’s society would 
not be in existence without the application of mathematics. In The Republic, the great Greek 
philosopher Plato presented a profound argument for why mathematics should be required 
for  all  high  school  and  college  students.  He  argued that mathematics and  geometry  teach 
problem-solving  skills  and  an  ability  to  analyze  and  think.  It  is  also  important  to  study 
mathematics because it gives one a different perspective on things. Learning mathematics 
involves a different type of thinking that is not addressed in other subjects.

Applications of mathematics 
13. 
While we all have some familiarity with the everyday uses of the elementary aspects 
of mathematics, there are far more advanced and complex phenomena in almost all fields of 
science, where mathematics is widely used, but often in an unseen and unadvertised way. 
Let me give only a few examples of diverse applications of mathematics:  
i. 
Travel by airplane would not have been possible without the mathematics of airflow 
and control systems.  
The spaceships’ journey to the planets could not have been calculated without the 
mathematics of differential equations. The stunning pictures of far away planets sent 
by Voyager II could not have had their crispness and quality without mathematics.  
The  advances  in  development  of  supercomputers  is  backed  by  the  application  of 
mathematical  theory  which  instructs  the  computer  on  what  is  to  be  done,  thereby 
allowing it to optimally utilise its capacity for speed and accuracy.  
The next generation of software requires the latest methods in Category Theory, a 
theory  of  mathematical  structures  which  has  given  new  perspectives  on  the 
foundations of mathematical logic.  
Mathematical methods provide the backbone of Statistical theory and methodology 
for the analysis of wide varieties of data in Economics, Banking, Finance, Physical 
Sciences, Genetics, Biology, and so on.  
Body scanners are the expression of subtle mathematics, which makes it possible to 
construct an image of the inside of an object from information on a number of single 
X-ray views of it. Thus, mathematics is often involved in matters of life and death.  
14. 
These applications have often been developed from the study of general ideas for 
their  own  sake:  numbers,  symmetry,  area  and  volume,  rate  of  change,  shape,  dimension, 
randomness  and  many  others.  Mathematics  makes  a  special  contribution  to  the  study  of 
these  ideas,  namely,  the  methods  of  (a)  precise  definitions;  (b)  careful  and  rigorous 
argument;  representation  of  ideas  by  many  methods,  including  symbols  and  formulae, 
pictures  and  graphics;  (c)  means  of  calculation;  (d)  obtaining  precise  solutions  to  clearly 
stated  problems,  or  clear  statements  of  the  limits  of  knowledge.  These  features  allow 
mathematics  to  provide  a  solid  foundation  to  many  aspects  of  daily  life,  and  to  give  a 
comprehension of the complexities inherent in apparently simple situations.  
15. 
However,  while  mathematics  is  applied  to  both  physical  sciences  and  social  / 
biological sciences, there are certain differences in the application of mathematics to the two 
areas. As physical sciences are more exact in nature, mathematics can be readily applied to 
them.  However,  social/  biological  sciences  are  more  uncertain  and  involve  elements  of 
errors.  Hence,  statistics  and  probabilities  find  greater  application  in  these  areas.  You,  as 
students,  have  to  decide  on  the  area  which  is  of  greater  interest  to  you  and  pursue 
knowledge and excellence in that area.

Maths in Indian context 
16. 
What is India’s contribution to the subject of Mathematics? Let me refer to an old 
song  from  the  movie  “Purab  aur  Paschim”  (lyrics:  Indeevar  and  others)  picturised  on  the 
celebrated actor Manoj Kumar, “ ……Bharat ka rahne waala hoon, Bharat ki baat sunaata 
hoon....” – how many of you have heard? I am sure all of the speakers here and even the 
teachers. The song has some excellent lines depicting India’s contribution to the subject of 
Mathematics. The lines are as under:  
“जब ज़ीरो �दया मेरे भारत ने, भारत ने मेरे भारत ने, दु�नया को तब �गनती आई, 
तार� क� भाषा दु�नया को , भारत ने पहले �सखलाई |  
देता ना दशमलव भारत तो, यू
ँ चांद पे जाना मुिश्कल था, 
धरती और चांद क� दूर� का, अंदाज़ा लगाना मुिश्कल था |” 
Loosely  translated,  extolling  the  contribution  of  India  to  the  field  of  mathematics  and 
astronomy,  the  protagonist  conveys  that  “It  was  only  with  the  invention  of  zero  by  Indian 
mathematicians that the World could get its number system. Also, without India’s contribution 
to the decimal system, it would not have been possible to fathom the distance between Earth 
and the Moon or to manage a voyage to the Moon”.  
It  is  necessary  to  reminisce  about  the  past  heady  days  of  Indian  mathematics, 
17. 
beginning  from  the  Vedic  period.  The  ancient  Vedas  (synthesized  about  5000  years  ago) 
contained Vedanga Jyotisha comprising three parts, one of which pertains to basic math about 
arithmetic,  algebra,  geometry,  trigonometry  and  equations  (Sameekaran).  India’s  primacy  in 
establishing the foundations of math is widely accepted among the scholars and practitioners 
in  math.  It  is  apt  to  note  what  the  famous  French  mathematician  Laplace  (1749–1827)  had 
remarked: “It is India that gave us the ingenious method of expressing all numbers by means of 
ten symbols, each symbol receiving a place value position as well as an absolute value. The 
idea escaped the genius of Archimedes and Apollonius”. While the Indian system of counting 
has been the most successful intellectual innovation ever made, the most intelligent invention 
is that of zero, the inclusion of which added much needed wholeness and completeness to the 
system of natural numbers and for making it the very basic building block of the real number 
system.  Unfortunately,  the  rich  heritage  and  achievements  of  our  ancient  and  pre-medieval 
Indian mathematicians were sort of rediscovered and then reintroduced from the West in the 
regular curricula on mathematics.  
It is, indeed, very saddening to note that for the past 2000 years India’s contribution 
18. 
in the field of mathematics has been negligible. We should not rest on our past laurels and 
allow complacency to set in. We need to re-establish our position of preeminence in the area 
of mathematics and mathematical research by contributing new thoughts and concepts to the 
body of knowledge on mathematics. Our students and teachers of mathematics and others 
associated with the academic world have to contribute significantly to make it happen. 
Mathematics is challenging 
19. 
One  should,  however,  remember  that  mathematics  is  also  one  of  the  most 
challenging disciplines. It calls for special skills and mental ability to visualize the mysteries 
of  the  universe  through  abstract  patterns,  symbols,  structures  and  formulae,  which  is 
mathematics.  As  Galileo  said  many  centuries  ago,  “The great  book  of  nature  can  be  read 
only  by  those  who  know  the  language  in  which  it  was  written.  And  that  language  is 
mathematics”.  
20. 
I  must  add  a  word  of  caution  here.  I  believe  that  you  must  have  the  necessary 
aptitude  for  studying  higher  mathematics.  In  case  you  do  not  have  the  numerical  aptitude 
and liking for numbers, please do not pursue higher studies in mathematics.

Mathematics as a career option 
21. 
Those  who  qualify  in  mathematics  are  in  the  fortunate  position  of  having  a  wide 
range of career choices. Their abilities (i) to use logical thought; (ii) to formulate a problem in 
a way which allows for computation and decision; (iii) to make deductions from assumptions; 
(iv) to use advanced concepts, are all enhanced by a mathematics degree course. It is for 
this  reason  that  mathematicians  are  increasingly  in  demand.  With  a  mathematics  degree, 
you  should  be  able  to  try  your  hand  in  banking  and  finance,  statistics,  engineering, 
computers, teaching, econometrics, biometrics, or accountancy with a unique edge that may 
not be available to those graduating in other streams.  
22. 
Thus, one of the benefits of studying mathematics is the variety of career options 
that  open  up.  A  recent  survey  has  shown  that  graduates  in  mathematics  and  computer 
science were at the top of the earning lists, six years after graduation. In one such study in 
The Wall Street Journal (2009) on the best and worst jobs in the US, it was observed that the 
top three out of the best two hundred jobs listed in order of income and other factors were 
careers suited for math majors, namely, mathematics, actuary and statistics. Besides other 
favorable conditions like indoor working conditions and places free of toxic fumes or noise, 
the study also considers pay, which was determined by measuring each job’s median income 
and growth potential. Another recent survey shows that the top 15 highest-earning college 
degrees have a common element: mathematics.  
23. 
for  students  of  mathematics  are: 
(a) Mathematics  proper  as  teaching  assignment  as  well  as  research  in  the  theoretical 
aspects; (b) Actuarial science that develops applied tools using mathematics and statistics 
and  using  them  in  finance  and  insurance;  it  includes  a  number  of  inter-related  disciplines, 
including probability and statistics, finance, and economics; (c) Computer science, based on 
the  theoretical  foundations  of  computation  and  their  implementation  and  application  in 
computer systems. Students of maths, with their training in logical and precise thinking, are 
highly prized in this field. (d) Operations research, developed as an interdisciplinary branch 
of mathematics to arrive at optimal decisions to problems in maximizing or minimizing things 
like  costs  or  profits.  (e)  Biomathematics  or  mathematical  biology,  also  an  interdisciplinary 
field  of  study  that  helps  in  modeling  natural  and  biological  processes  using  mathematical 
techniques  and  tools.  Results  have  been  applied  to  areas  such  as  cellular  neurobiology, 
epidemic  modeling,  and  population  genetics.  (f)  Cryptography  is  the  practice  and  study  of 
hiding  information.  Cryptography  is  considered  to  be  a  branch  of  both  mathematics  and 
computer science.  
24. 
While  applied  mathematics  is  appreciated  and  understood  by  many  people,  pure 
maths  is  considered  very  elitist.  Another  career  and  research  prospect  that  has  got 
tremendous boost of late is computation based analysis, which many purists do not accept 
as mainstream mathematics. Actually, many IT professionals who joined in the big leap of 
Silicon Valley revolution in the last couple of decades are now increasingly finding this job of 
analytics more rewarding and challenging.

Some  of 
Where math can help in central banking 
25. 
Two important areas of application of Mathematics, more specifically Statistics, are 
economic  modeling  and  forecasting,  and  financial  mathematics.  Central  Banks  around  the 
world are engaged in developing a suite of modern macroeconomic/ econometric models of 
the economy as a basis for informed macroeconomic, monetary, financial sector and fiscal 
policy decisions. It is now of critical importance, particularly, in light of the current challenges 
facing the economy. The importance of modeling macroeconomic variables has become all 
the more critical because macroeconomic policy formulation needs to anchor its functional 
role in developing a full understanding of the economy as well as influencing domestic policy 
formulation in a logical framework.  
Let me explain what is modeling and why it is important:  
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
It  is  trying  to  study  and  analyse  different  phenomena.  For  this  –  you  have  to  quantify  the 
phenomenon so as to be able to relate to them. For example, how much space does a box 
contain? 
We  know  volume  =  length  X  width  X  height  and  as  the  length,  width  and  height  can  be 
measured, we have a simple model to represent the space inside a box.  
26. 
Financial  mathematics  is  a  relatively  new  discipline,  rooted  in  modern  economic 
thought,  yet  steeped  in  the  classical  intellectual  disciplines  of  chance  and  uncertainty. 
Tracing its origins to the early 1970s, and maybe more so, to the introduction of the personal 
computer,  financial  engineering’s  early  triumphs  include  the  development  of  structured 
mortgage-backed securities (now the biggest bond market) and a rationale for option pricing 
–  the  consequences  of  which  are  totally  pervasive  in  modern  investing,  the  markets,  and 
finance.  Central  Banking  job  has  been  made  much  more  challenging  because  it  needs  to 
understand, may be ahead of others in a forward looking framework, the finer aspects used 
to construct and deploy the financial transactions and processes. These are the mechanisms 
enabling the creation/employment of wealth and for the worldwide distribution of well-being 
within the constraints and intent of global financial policy.  
27. 
Modeling  exercises  in  macroeconomics  have  been  rendered  more  complex  and 
arduous  because  of  complexities  and  nonlinearities  displayed  by  behavioral  aspects  of 
economic  agents.  The  traditional  economic  models  depended  heavily  on  linearization  of 
complex economic behavior expressed in simple mathematical terms.  
28. 
Like  much  of  engineering,  financial  mathematics  constructively  uses  fundamental 
mathematical  and  scientific  principles  with  professional  practices  to  yield  products  and 
processes.  Rather  than  trying  to  understand  the  socio-economic  interplay  of  wealth  and 
well-being, financial mathematics considers a flow of cash (the cash-flow): its exchange, its 
contingency, and its value both in a relative and an absolute sense. These could be from the 
standpoint  of  the  investor  (central  bank,  insurance  company,  mutual  fund,  for  example),  a 
Wall Street dealer, a global bank, or a hedge fund. The flow of cash could be packaged as a 
stock, bond, option, swap, or exchange of currency.  
29. 
Unlike  positive  sciences  like  physics  and  chemistry,  one  has  to  take  a  lot  of  care 
when dealing  with behavioural sciences like economics and finance. Lots of measurement 
and  benchmarking  issues  come  up,  particularly,  in  the  modern  complex  world  of  business 
and commerce that await proper quantifications and standardization with precision and rigor. 
Many  would  have  read  how  floating  of  risky  financial  products,  not  tractable  by  the 
established norms of controllable behavioral norms, jeopardized functioning of markets and 
the  global  economy.  With  the  expanding  scope  of  business  and  finance,  demand  for 
mathematical  acumen  and  empirical  analyses  have  become  ever  increasing.  However,  we 
need  to  guard  against  utter  predominance  and  capture  of  the  finance  profession  by  the 
students of mathematics.  
Problems with numbers – life in a central bank is as challenging as is the real life 
Now that I have shared with you the uses of mathematics in Central Banking, let me 
30. 
also  discuss  some  challenges/difficulties that the  “use  of  numbers”  pose  in  our  day-to-day 
office work vis-a-vis the general perception prevalent in the public domain due to improper 
interpretation of maths. Let me give three examples:  
a. 
Gold Purchases: You may have come across news reports about the large current 
account  deficit  facing  the  country  and  the  large  import  of  gold  being  one  of  the 
important reasons for this. We often hear the argument that people buy gold as a 
hedge  against  inflation  or  that  they  are  investing  in  a  “safe  asset”.  These  people 
use, or should one say, misuse mathematics to buttress their argument by relying on 
the figure of gold price appreciation in the recent past. However, to me, the data on 
gold price appreciation is the most convincing argument for why investing in gold is 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 7 
b. 
neither  a  hedge  against  inflation,  nor  a  safe  asset.  Let  me  explain.  What  is  the 
characteristic of a hedge against inflation? – it should protect your principal by giving 
a return slightly above the inflation rate. However, the rate of gold price appreciation 
in the recent past has been far in excess of the inflation rate and, hence, cannot be 
characterized  as  a  hedge.  In  contrast,  it  can  be  termed  as  speculation  against 
inflation.  Similarly,  the  fundamental  principal  of  risk-return  trade-off  states  that 
greater  returns  can  be  achieved  only  by  assuming  greater  risks.  The  significantly 
higher  returns  offered  by  gold  in  the  past  few  years  only  indicates  that  the  risks 
implicit  in  investing  in  gold  have  also  significantly  increased.  Even  if  we  calculate 
volatility in the gold prices over a longer time horizon, it would be far in excess of 
that observed in other financial assets. Hence, the rationale for investing in gold as a 
“safe  asset”  is  contrary  to  conventional  wisdom  of  what  constitutes  a  “safe 
investment”. Mathematics disapproves that gold is a hedge against inflation or that it 
is a safe asset. Unfortunately, this is not fully understood either by investors in gold 
or  even  a  significant  section  of  opinion  makers  and  policy  makers.  We  have  no 
problem  if  proponents  of  gold  encourage  gold  purchases  by  portraying  it  as  a 
“speculation against inflation” or a “risky investment” (i.e. right use of mathematics) 
rather  than  by  calling  it  as  a  “hedge  against  inflation”  or  a  “safe  investment” 
(improper use of mathematics).  
Productivity  in  Banks:  In  banks,  one  of  the  most  commonly  used  measures  of 
productivity is Business per Employee. However, any student of mathematics having 
some  basic  understanding  of  the  concept  of  unit  and  dimension  will  say  that 
Business per Employee may be a good measure of productivity across space but a 
very  poor  measure  of  productivity  over  time.  If  we  use  this  ratio  as  a  measure of 
productivity  over  time  in  banks/financial  institutions for  deciding manpower  issues, 
viz.  recruitment  of  staff,  promotions,  etc.,  consequences  would  not  only  be 
erroneous but can also be dangerous. Even in deciding on the number of General 
Managers  (GMs)  or  Executive  Directors  (EDs)  to  be  provided  to  banks,  policy 
makers  are  depending  on  the  volume  of  business.  Can  we  not  decide  on  these 
issues in a better way by proper use of mathematics, say, based on staff expenses 
per  100 rupees  of  asset/  business  or salary  paid  to GMs/EDs  as  a  percentage of 
total assets/business of banks?  
Financial  inclusion  and  numbers:  I  am  sure  you  have  heard  of  our  initiatives 
towards  financial  inclusion,  the  business  correspondents,  the  basic  banking 
accounts, etc. Banks often use “number of accounts” and “number of transactions” 
as  two  indicators  for  measuring  progress  in  financial  inclusion.  It  is  common  for 
banks  to  claim  progress  in  financial  inclusion  stating  that  the  number  of  accounts 
opened  has  gone  up  by  100%  over  a  period.  This  use  of  mathematics  to  claim 
progress  in  financial  inclusion  can  be  terribly  misleading.  On  delving  deeper,  one 
realizes that while 100 accounts in the previous period have, indeed, increased to 
200 accounts, there is no substantive progress in terms of banking penetration and 
financial inclusion in real terms, since the total number of villages covered, number 
of BCs employed, have also increased manifold during the period. The increase in 
number  of  accounts  is,  thus,  merely  a  reflection  of  the  expanded  geographical 
coverage and not of any improvement in banking penetration in existing locations. 
Similarly, the number of transactions made per month may have gone up from 50 to 
100 but, simultaneously, the total number of accounts may also have gone up from 
200  to  1000.  Thus,  this  100%  increase  in  the  number  of  transactions  does  not 
indicate  an  increase  in  efficiency  or  deepening  of  financial  inclusion.  Number  of 
accounts  per  1000  population  and  number  of  transactions  per  account  are  better 
mathematical ratios to judge the progress in financial inclusion.

The  above  three  examples  that  I  have  given  based  on  my  day  to  day  office 
experience, are only indicative of the irrational choices that could be made, if mathematics,

as a decision making tool, is not properly used. The students of mathematics must, therefore, 
be extremely careful as conclusions based on improper use of numbers can lead to adverse 
policy decisions.  
Conclusion 
32. 
The key message that I want to convey, particularly to the students, is that not only 
the past, but also the future of mathematics and mathematicians is glorious and bright. While 
mathematics, in its pure form, is scaling greater heights, the horizons of its applications in 
various  classical  and  new  fields  of  science  are  expanding  at  a  fast  pace.  Besides  the 
physical and biological sciences, new applications are found in economics, finance, banking 
and many other fields. In view of such diverse applications of mathematics, the whole world 
needs mathematicians. Internationally, Indian students and scientists are considered to have 
a reputation in mathematics. There is a need to nurture and sustain this natural advantage 
which  will  attract  bright  students  to  the  field  of  mathematics  and  also  provide  them  with 
numerous  career  options.  However,  in  view  of  the  numerous  applications  of  mathematics, 
students  have  to  identify  their  areas  of  interest  and  develop  domain  knowledge  in  that 
particular area. While a career in mathematics research could be pursued by those with a 
passion for it, others need to focus on building up specialized expertise in their chosen area 
of application of mathematics.

that I am going to tell you: 
While concluding, I would always want you to be like the mathematician in the story 
A mathematician, a physicist, and an engineer were traveling through Scotland 
when they saw a black sheep through the window of the train. “Aha”, says the 
engineer, “I see that Scottish sheep are black”. “Hmm”, says the physicist, “You 
mean that some Scottish sheep are black”. “No”, says the mathematician, “All we 
know is that there is at least one sheep in Scotland, and that at least one side of 
that one sheep is black!” 
34. 
I  would  end  by  once  again  thanking  the  organizers  for  inviting  me  to  this  forum 
which,  I  am  sure,  will  generate  valuable  awareness  and  insight  about  the  prospects  for 
mathematics and mathematicians. I have told you so much about maths, its applicability in 
central banking and problems with numbers that I encounter in my day to day work at the 
RBI,  I  hope  that  all  of  you  will  study  mathematics,  make  a  name  and  a  great  career  for 
yourself. I wish you all a bright future and the Conference all success!  
Thank You.
