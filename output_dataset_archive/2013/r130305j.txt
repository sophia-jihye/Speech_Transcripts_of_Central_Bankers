Duvvuri Subbarao: Financial literacy and financial inclusion are integral 
to each other 
Inaugural remarks by Dr Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 
India-OECD-World  Bank  Regional  Conference  on  “Financial  education”,  New  Delhi, 
4 March 2013. 
 RBI partnership with OECD and World Bank 
1.  RBI  is  delighted  to  have  this  opportunity  to  partner  with  two  premiere  international 
institutions – the OECD and the World Bank – on this very important conference on financial 
education. 
2. Hearty welcome to all the delegates from around the world and across India. 
RBI and financial literacy 
3.  Why  is  the  Reserve  Bank  –  a  central  bank,  whose  core  concern  is  maintaining  price 
stability and supporting growth – in the forefront on a quintessentially development issue like 
financial literacy? 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Because of 2 reasons 
First reason 
RBI has a wider mandate than a typical central bank. 
Historically RBI has played an important developmental role in the financial sector. 
The Lead Bank Scheme initiated in 1969 whereby a bank is designated in every 
district of the country as the lead bank to coordinate the flow of credit from all banks 
in the district consistent with a district credit plan. 
Priority  Sector  Lending  –  whereby  banks  are  mandated  to  lend  a  minimum 
prescribed portion of their total lending to designated priority sectors. 
 RBI has provided innovative leadership on financial inclusion initiatives. 
The Reserve Bank is in the forefront of financial inclusion and financial literacy campaigns 
because we believe that a banking regulator, particularly in a large developing economy like 
India,  has  a  unique  advantage  and  opportunity  as  also  a  distinct  obligation  to  further 
these goals. 
GOI and RBI work together. 
Financial Literacy and Financial Stability 
Why is RBI in the forefront? (Second reason) 
There  is  another  important  reason  why  central  banks,  not  only  in  EMDEs,  but  even  in 
advanced economies, are getting to play a role in financial literacy. This reason stems from 
the experience of the 2008/09 global financial crisis.  
• 
• 
Many root causes and many proximate causes for the crisis. 
One  of  the  root  causes  is  the  lack  of  understanding  of  financial  matters  that  led 
sub-prime borrowers into contracting teaser rate loans. 
It is indeed possible to argue that the sub-prime problem would not have grown to 
explosive proportions that it did if people had been more financial literate. 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 1 
    Bernanke: “Helping people better understand how to borrow and save wisely and 
how  to  build  personal  wealth  is  one  of  the  best  things  we  can  do  to  improve  the 
well-being of families and communities.” 
In post-crisis reform measures across all advanced economies, there is a big thrust 
on consumer protection. 
By  far  the  best  and  most  effective  way  of  protecting  consumers  is  to  make  them 
financially literate. 
To summarize, the answer to the question: “what is the locus standi of a central 
bank in financial literacy”, the answer is that 
– 
Part,  indeed  an  important  part,  of  the  mandate  of  a  central  bank  is  to 
preserve financial stability. 
An essential prerequisite for financial stability is financial literacy. 
A central bank has a unique leverage in providing financial literacy 
 What should I say? 
4. Struggled here to determine what I should say at this inaugural that will add value to the 
conference. Given the depth of frontline experience and subject matter expertise that all of 
you  bring  to  this  forum,  it  will  be  presumptuous  on  my  part  to  lay  out  the  agenda  for  the 
deliberations over the next 3 days. I feel distinctly inadequate. I will attempt something much 
less ambitious. 
I will give you 
(i) 
The  big  picture  of  the  challenge  of  financial  inclusion  and  financial  literacy  –  in 
general and in India. 
Tell  you  briefly  about the  Reserve  Bank’s  accomplishments  and  challenges  in  the 
area of financial inclusion and financial literacy. 
Raise  some  introspective  and  important  questions  that  we  must  be  asking 
ourselves. 
(ii) 
(iii) 
Financial inclusion and financial literacy 
5. This conference, I know, is on financial education. Nevertheless, you would have found 
me speaking about financial inclusion and financial literacy together, almost synonymously. 
That is not confusion. That is deliberate. 
•

• 
Financial inclusion and financial literacy are integral to each other. 
They are two elements of an integral strategy. 
Financial inclusion provides access 
Financial literacy provides awareness 
Disadvantaged people need both – access to and awareness of financial services. 
Financial inclusion – supply side 
Financial literacy – demand side 
 Broader question: why are financial inclusion and financial literacy important? 
6. Why are financial inclusion and financial literacy important? 
2 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
They are important simply because financial inclusion is a necessary condition for sustaining 
equitable growth. There are few, if any, instances of an economy transiting from an agrarian 
system to a post-industrial modern society without broad-based financial inclusion. 
7.  As  people  having  comfortable  access  to  financial  services,  we  all  know  from  personal 
experience that economic opportunity is strongly intertwined with financial access. 
8. World Bank – attack on poverty 
• 
Seminal  WDR  on  Attacking  Poverty  –  2000/01.  Three  dimensions  of  attack  on 
poverty. 
– 
– 
Creating opportunities for the poor to improve their lives. 
Empowering  the  poor  to  demand  more  responsive  state  and  social 
institutions. 
Providing the poor security – to cope with risks. 
– 
Opportunity,  empowerment  and  security.  Financial  inclusion  is  important  on  all 
three dimensions. 
Development  experience  shows  that  the  poor  don’t  want  doles.  They  don’t  want 
hand outs. What they want is opportunity. 
Financial inclusion and financial literacy are essential to give that opportunity. They 
enfranchise the poor in a very powerful way, and give them security against income 
shocks. 
   Financial inclusion in India 
9.  Let  me  get  a  little  more  specific.  Take  India.  Financial  inclusion  is  good  for  all  the 
stakeholders. 
• 
• 
• 
Good for the poor. Opportunity to improve their incomes and their quality of life. 
Good for the banks. Steady low cost savings – ALM. 
Good  for  the  government.  Powerful  tool  of  poverty  reduction,  it  also  cuts  down 
leakage. 
Good for the economy, savings of the poor into the formal financial sector. 
600,000–100,000 bank branches – just about 10% 
Only 40% of the households have bank accounts 
Financial exclusion is staggering 
• 
10.  Win-win  for  the  poor,  banks,  government  and  economy.  Not  just  a  public  good  but  a 
merit good.

13. Financial literacy 
• 
Liberalized the KYC norms for basic banking account without any minimum balance 
RBI prepared a National Strategy on Financial Education catering to all sections of 
the population in the country. 
Simple, comprehensive and inclusive. 
Since  the  challenge  is  to  link  large  number  of  financially  excluded  people  to  the 
formal  financial  system,  the  focus  of  the  Strategy  at  the  base  level  is  to  create 
awareness of basic financial products. For the purpose, the financial literacy efforts 
is  primarily  directed  towards  dissemination  of  simple  messages  of  financial 
prudence  in  vernacular  language  through  large  campaigns  across  the  country 
combined  with  vigorous  roll  out  of  financial  inclusion  plans  by  banks,  insurance, 
pension funds and others. 
The  strategy  is  inclusive  –  active,  involves  individuals,  financial  sector  regulators, 
educational  institutions,  NGOs,  financial  sector  entities,  multilateral  international 
players and the Government at both Centre and State. 
14. Banks and financial literacy 
• 
We have advised banks that there should be at least one Financial Literacy Centres 
(FLC) in all the districts (640+) throughout the country. These FLCs are required to 
conduct  outdoor  financial  literacy  camps  at  least  once  in  a  month.  Banks  have 
already set up about 650 FLCs till date. 
Further, every rural branch (35000+) is required to conduct a financial literacy camp 
at least once in a month. Through these camps, we envisage imparting of financial 
literacy in the form of simple messages like why save with banks, why borrow from 
banks, why borrow as far as possible for income generating activities, why repay in 
time, why insure yourself, why save for your retirement etc. 
Starting from April 2012, we have been able to educate about 1 million plus people 
through these literacy programs.

Meaningful financial inclusion (Toilet, Bank a/c) 
New bank licences 
19. New bank licences. Strategy for financial inclusion will be an important criticism. 
Criticism against RBI: RBI open minded to innovation. 
20. Introspective but Important Question: 
• 
Do  we  know  enough  about  the  poor  to  deepen  financial  inclusion  and  further 
financial literacy? 
Do  we  understand  enough  about  how  the  poor  manage  their  finances  in  order  to 
design products and services that meet their requirements? 
Are we approaching the problem with an open mind or are we too clouded by our 
stereotype  views  to  understand  why  the  poor  behave  in  such  seemingly  irrational 
ways? 
Are  we  too  patronizing  in  our  approach  to  be  dismissive  of  the  concerns  and 
apprehensions of the poor? 
Ela  Bhatt  [SEWA]:  WDR  2000/01:  We  are  poor  but  so  many:  “Illiteracy  is  on  the 
other side of the table”. 
Portfolios of the poor 
21. Frame these questions in a more concrete fashion. 
(i) 
 
WB norm for poverty is $2/day. 
One  of  the  least  understood  problems  of  living  on  $2/day  is  that  you  don’t  earn 
$2 every day. That is the average over time. How do you cope with that? 
The poor not only have low incomes, but their income is irregular and unpredictable. 
Their  savings  are  meagre.  But,  yet  they  have  to  cope  with  loss  of  employment, 
illness  and  death  in  the  family,  lumpy  expenditure  needs  for  education  and  for 
weddings and festivals?

 (vi) 
One stereotype view is “How can the poor save – they have no money”. This is only 
superficially sensible. The poor should save because like everybody else they have 
a present and a future. They have little money today, but unless they stumble on a 
pile of cash tonight, they have little money tomorrow. 
Another  stereotype  view:  The  poor’s  savings  are  meagre.  They  don’t  need  much 
financial management techniques. In fact, because the poor have low, irregular and 
unpredictable incomes, they need sophisticated financial management. $20/day vs 
$2/day. 
Portfolios of poor by Daryl Collins, Stuart Rutherford 
India, Bangladesh and South Africa 
Need sophisticated financial management 
Diaries – fascinating how they cope with everyday finances. 
The  truth  is  that  money  management  is,  for  the  poor,  a  fundamental  and  well 
understood part of everyday life. 
The  stereotype  view  is  that  the  poor  are  carefree  or  incompetent.  Perish  that 
thought. They are anything but.

Why are the poor simultaneously saving and borrowing at the same time? 
Why in some countries, the poor actually pay money to save money – i.e. 
they actually accept (-)ve interest rate 
Ernakulam – Survey. Dependence on money lenders. 
Seemingly  irrational  behaviour  tells  us  a  lot  about  how  financial  inclusion 
should be pursued.

22. Fortune at the bottom of the pyramid 
Shibboleth or cliché 
•

   Fortune at the bottom of the pyramid is indeed there 
Astounding  success  of  millions  of  SHGs  across  the  country  –  a  heart  warming 
success story 
Nascent  capitalist  inside  every  poor  man  and  poor  woman.  Capitalists  without 
capital as Banerjee and Duflo call them. 
The abundance of entrepreneurism among the poor is the least recognized part of 
our understanding. 
Purely in terms of stated occupations, most income groups in poor countries seem 
to be more entrepreneurial than their counterparts in the developed world – the poor 
no  less  so  than  others,  an  observation  that  inspired  Harvard  Business  School 
professor Tarun Khanna’s book, Billions of Entrepreneurs. 
Financial literacy and inclusion – challenge not unique to developing countries 
23.  Economist  a  couple  of  weeks  ago.  Feature  on  “life  on  the  edges  of  America’s 
financial mainstream”. 
• 
In  December  2012,  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (FDIC)  released  a 
survey that found roughly one in 12 American households, or some 17m adults, are 
“unbanked”, meaning they lack a current or savings account. 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  The survey also found that one in every five American households is “underbanked”, 
meaning  that  they  have  a  bank  account  but  also  rely  on  alternative  services  – 
typically,  high-cost  products  such  as  payday  loans,  cheque-cashing  services, 
non-bank money orders or pawn shops. 
Not all the unbanked are poor, nor do all poor people lack bank accounts. But the 
rate of the unbanked among low income households (defined in the FDIC survey as 
those with an annual income below $15,000) is more than three times the overall 
rate. 
Disturbing questions about financial literacy 
24. [Economist] – financial literacy 
• 
 Here is a test. Suppose you had $100 in a savings account that paid an interest rate 
of  2%  a  year.  If  you  leave  the  money  in  the  account,  how  much  would  you  have 
accumulated after five years: more than $102, exactly $ 102, or less than $102? 
This  test  is  so  simple  that  you  suspect  there  is a  catch. There  is  no  catch.  But  a 
survey found that only half of Americans aged over 50 gave the correct answer. If so 
many people are financially challenged, it is hardly surprising that they struggle to 
deal with financial decisions. 
The solution seems obvious: provide more financial education. 
But  is  it  possible  to  teach  people  to  be  more  financial  savvy?  A  survey  by  the  Federal 
Reserve Bank of Cleveland reported that: “Unfortunately, we do not find conclusive evidence 
that, in general, financial education programmes do lead to greater financial knowledge and 
ultimately to better financial behaviour.” 
So, is financial education programme a failure? Certainly not. The purpose of education is to 
teach  people  to  deal  with  financial  decisions  more  intelligently  and  with  greater  sense  of 
confidence.

Summary and conclusion 
25. Let me summarize the point that I have been trying to make: 
(i) 
(ii) 
 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Problems of access and awareness in deepening financial inclusion and spreading 
financial literacy. 
Problem in poor countries. 
Problem also in rich countries. 
Perish stereotype views. 
Easy to attribute it all to sociological and demographic factors. But there is evidence 
to show that given the same sociological and demographic context, some countries 
have  done  better  than  others.  So,  strategies,  policies  and  commitment  do 
matter. 
More importantly imagination and innovation are required. 
There is no one size fits all. On the contrary, we must let a thousand flowers bloom, 
let  thousands  of  real  life  experiments  take  place.  Learn  from  that  collective 
experience to determine what works, what does not and why?
