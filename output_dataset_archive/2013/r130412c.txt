the Republic of Macedonia 
Address by Mr Dimitar Bogov, Governor of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, 
at the presentation of the Needs Analysis Programme for the National Bank of the Republic 
of Macedonia in the process of accession to the European System of Central Banks and the 
Eurosystem to the public, Skopje, 22 January 2013. 
 Your Excellency Ambassador Orav,  
Honorable  Director  General  of  the  International  and  European  Relations  at  the  ECB, 
Mr Moss, 
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, media representatives, 
It is my great pleasure and honor to greet you today at the National Bank of the Republic of 
Macedonia  for  the  public  presentation  of  the  Needs  Analysis  Programme  for  the  National 
Bank of the Republic of Macedonia in the process of accession to the European System of 
Central Banks and the Eurosystem. 
First, I would like to thank the EU for the financial assistance provided and to express my 
special gratitude to the EU Delegation in our country for the given support in obtaining the 
project. Also, I would like to express my gratitude to the ECB for the efforts and readiness to 
carry  out  the  project  with  the  NBRM  and  to  the  national  central  banks  of  the  Eurosystem 
involved in the project for their willingness to contribute to its implementation. 
Taking into account the strategic commitment of our country for EU membership, a few years 
ago,  the  NBRM  initiated  this  project  of  cooperation  with  the  ECB  in  order  to  identify  the 
necessary  changes  in  the  national  regulation,  and  the  needed  organization  and  human 
resources of the NBRM towards achieving EU central banking standards. The realization of 
the  project,  and  hopefully,  obtaining  of  a  subsequent  project for  the  implementation  of  the 
recommendations that will arise from this programme, should enable the NBRM to carry out 
the  process  of  joining  the  European  System  of  Central  Banks,  and  later  the  Eurosystem 
more easily and efficiently, once the Republic of Macedonia meets the EU accession criteria.  
Over the past three months, experts from the ECB and the national central banks included in 
the  project,  in  collaboration  with  the  experts  from  the  NBRM,  carried  out  the  activities 
planned with the first stage of setting the benchmarks according to the European standards 
and best practices for the operations of the NBRM in ten areas: monetary and exchange rate 
policy, economic analysis and research, statistics, payment systems, banknotes, accounting, 
legal services, internal audit, information technology and human resources. As a result of the 
good cooperation of the experts, their commitment and dedication to the project, at today’s 
first  meeting,  the  Steering  Committee  adopted  the  benchmarks  in  all  planned  areas, 
whereby,  I  am  pleased  to  say  that  the  first  stage  of  the  project  has  been  successfully 
completed. 
In the forthcoming period, the Eurosystem experts should assess the legal framework and 
the NBRM’s practice in these areas and identify “the gaps” against the agreed benchmarks, 
to  which 
for  open  collaboration.  The 
recommendations and directions that will be presented in the form of the report at the third 
and  final  phase,  will  be  the  basis  for  designing  the  future  strategy  of  the  NBRM  for 
strengthening its institutional capacity  
Ladies and gentlemen, the implementation of the European standards and best practices by 
the NBRM is of utmost importance, as it will not only enable the process of accession of the 
NBRM to the European System of Central Banks, but it will also contribute to the providing of

price stability and stability and efficiency of the financial system in the country, in general, 
which is a precondition for EU membership. 
Rest  assured  that  the  management  and  the  employees  of  the  NBRM  will  address  this 
challenge in a professional manner and will use this project to further strengthen the capacity 
and credibility of our institution. 
Finally, let me wish all the participants in the project a successful cooperation in their future 
work, believing that the cooperation with the ECB and the national central banks of the ESCB 
will  further  deepen  in  the  future.  I  would  once  again  like  to  thank  the  EU  Delegation  for 
enabling  the  implementation  of  this  project  with  the  hope  for  further  support  in  providing 
subsequent  project  for  the  implementation  of  the  recommendations,  and  thank  the  other 
guests for their presence.
