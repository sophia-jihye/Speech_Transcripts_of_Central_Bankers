Mervyn King: Monetary policy – many targets, many instruments. Where do we stand? 
Remarks by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the IMF Conference on 
“Rethinking macro policy II: first steps and early lessons”, Washington DC, 16 April 2013. 
 I would like to thank Charlie Bean, Alex Brazier, Spencer Dale, Andy Haldane and Iain de Weymarn for helpful 
comments and suggestions in preparing these remarks; and in particular Tim Taylor who I regard as a co-author, 
although he is absolved of any errors in the current draft. 
Introduction 
The  past  five  years  has  been  an  extraordinary  period  for  central  banks.  The  breadth  and 
scale  of  our  operations  has  expanded  in  ways  that  were  previously  unimaginable  as  we 
responded to a crisis in the banking sector and the wider economy. In monetary policy, we 
have moved into uncharted territory. But has our notion of what central banks should do, and 
how, changed? Now is a good time to reflect on where we stand.  
I want to focus my remarks on two areas. First, I want to draw out what have we learned 
about the objectives of monetary policy. Second, I want to reflect on the implications of the 
proliferation of instruments that have been used to meet those objectives. 
Objectives 
For over thirty years the objective of central banks was clear. It was to set monetary policy to 
achieve long-run price stability. But the events of the past five years have raised questions 
about how central banks manage the trade-offs between price stability, output stability and 
financial stability in order to meet our overall macroeconomic objectives. 
Throughout the era of inflation targeting, the importance of the trade-off between output and 
inflation stabilisation in the short term has been well understood. Monetary policy was seen 
as  aiming  at  a  target  for  inflation  in  the  long  run,  which  was  to  be  achieved  by  bringing 
inflation back to target over a suitable time horizon so as to avoid excessive volatility of real 
variables such as output and employment. Optimal monetary policy was seen as a choice of 
how best to navigate the short-run trade-off while ensuring that the long-run objective was 
met.  
Failure  to  deliver  price  stability  is  costly,  as  UK  experience  amply  demonstrates.  Chart  1 
shows the variance of inflation and of the output gap in the UK, using quarterly data for two 
periods.1  Contrast  the  performance  in  the  35  years  up  to  1992  with  the  first  15  years  of 
inflation targeting. Better policy can take some credit for this improvement, as the anchoring 
of inflation expectations led to a huge reduction in inflation volatility. 
It was tempting to think that we had moved onto the “Taylor frontier” – which maps feasible 
combinations  of  the  smallest  variances  of  the  output  gap  and  inflation.  The  Great  Stability 
appeared  to  be  a  permanent  break  from  earlier  periods  –  periods  when  monetary  policy 
exhibited more unpredictable behaviour and left the economy to the north-east of the Taylor 
frontier (Chart 2). And in one important sense it was – the dark days of double-digit inflation 
were consigned to the past.

nominal GDP to real GDP. The output gap is estimated as the difference between the log of real GDP and the 
trend path of log GDP, derived using the HP-filter. Source: ONS and Bank of England calculations.

But the Great Stability was not representative of a new normal. The variance of the output 
gap – though not inflation – has been much higher over the past five years as the financial 
crisis generated a deep recession (Chart 3). So what have we learned? 
The banking and broader economic crisis has demonstrated that macroeconomic policy can 
face an additional trade-off between ensuring the soundness of the financial system in the 
medium term, and keeping output in line with potential output and inflation on target in the 
near  term.  Such  a  trade-off  arises  because  financial  vulnerabilities  can  build  even  while 
output is growing steadily and inflation is low and stable. 
Let me give three examples of the sort of underlying mechanisms at play. First, persistent 
misperceptions of future spending power may generate a mix of demand that proves to be 
unsustainable. I believe this was an important factor underlying the crisis. Although output in 
deficit countries – like the UK – appeared to be growing at a sustainable rate, that gave a 
misleading impression of the sustainability of the Great Stability. In fact the level of domestic 
demand  was  too  high  and  the  level  of  net  exports  correspondingly  too  weak.  Second,  as 
Hyman  Minsky  described,  periods  of  stability  encourage  exuberance  in  credit  markets, 
leading  eventually  to  instability.  And  third,  low  short-term  policy  rates  may  encourage 
investors to take on more risk than they would otherwise accept as they “search for yield”. 
It  is  arguable  that  monetary  policy  paid  insufficient  heed  to  the  potential  impact  of  such 
financial vulnerabilities. Financial shocks are costly because their effects can be too rapid for 
policy easily to offset, and because they hit potential supply so creating a trade-off between 
output  and  inflation.  In  other  words,  the  Taylor  frontier  is  less  favourable  (further  from  the 
origin), when account is taken of financial shocks, than we might have believed. Taking the 
entire period of inflation targeting – including the recent past – might give a more accurate 
indication  of  where  this  “Minsky-Taylor”  frontier  lies  than  using  data  for  the  Great  Stability 
period alone (Chart 4). 
What implications does this have for monetary policy? Possibly none – if we can rely now on 
macroprudential tools to ensure financial sector resilience. But set those tools to one side for 
a moment. Monetary policy could be used to reach a point more like P in Chart 5, with less 
variation in the output gap and more variation in inflation than we have actually experienced 
over the past 20 years. Put another way, higher interest rates in the run up to the financial 
crisis  might  have  reduced  the  impact  of  the  subsequent  bust,  at  the  cost  of  below-target 
inflation and below-trend output before the crisis hit.2  
In  practice  new  macroprudential  tools  and  better  micro-prudential  supervision  will  improve 
the possibilities available to monetary policymakers. Having additional instruments in effect 
brings  about  a  favourable  shift  in  the  Minsky-Taylor  frontier  (or  surface)  which  defines  the 
possibilities open to policymakers.3 
Nevertheless, consistent with the new remit4 given to the Monetary Policy Committee by the 
UK  Government  last  month,  the  experience  of  recent  years  suggests  that  there  may  be 
                                                 
2  A  more  detailed  appraisal  of  this  argument  is  contained  in  “Twenty  years  of  inflation  targeting”,  a  speech  by 
Mervyn King (2012), available at http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2012/606.aspx. 
3  A social  planner  would  use  both  instruments together to  pick the  welfare maximising  point on the frontier / 
surface, and in the UK the Monetary Policy Committee is expected to work closely with the Financial Policy 
Committee which has the statutory power to deploy macro-prudential instruments. 
4  The  relevant  passage  in  the  Monetary  Policy  Committee’s  remit  states:  “Circumstances  may  also  arise  in 
which attempts to keep inflation at the inflation target could exacerbate the development of imbalances that 
the  Financial  Policy  Committee  may  judge  to  represent  a  potential  risk  to  financial  stability.  The  Financial 
Policy  Committee’s  macro-prudential  tools  are  the  first  line  of  defence  against  such  risks,  but  in  these 
circumstances the Committee may wish to allow inflation to deviate from the target temporarily, consistent with 
its need to have regard to the policy actions of the Financial Policy Committee. The full remit is available here:

circumstances  in  which  it  is  justified  to  aim  off  the  inflation  target  for  a  while  in  order  to 
moderate the risk of financial crises. 
Instruments 
For institutions generally regarded as conservative or even hidebound, central banks have 
been remarkably innovative in their creation of new instruments during the crisis. Lowering 
official interest rates virtually to zero was extraordinary in itself. But the wholesale redesign of 
frameworks to supply liquidity to the banking system, the expansion of the monetary base by 
multiples of its pre-crisis level through the purchase of assets held by the non-bank private 
sector, and the involvement of central banks in risky credit easing operations have all raised 
serious questions about the role of central banks – and even challenged the idea of central 
bank independence. 
Table 1 shows just how large has been the scale of central bank expansion. The monetary 
base  has  risen  by  unprecedented  proportions  as  we  tried  to  prevent  a  collapse  of  broad 
money and credit as happened in the US during the Great Depression and today in Greece. 
And  central  bank  balance  sheets  have  risen  across  the  industrialised  world,  as  shown  in 
Table  2.  That  expansion  has  reflected  both  money  creation  through  asset  purchases  and 
lending  against  collateral.  All  major  central  banks  have  created  new  ways  to  lend  against 
collateral.5  Far  from  their  image  as  conservative  creatures,  are  central  banks  at  risk  of 
throwing their traditional caution to the wind and ignoring the limits on monetary policy?  
Two limits are relevant in current circumstances. First, no matter how much liquidity is thrown 
at  the  banking  system,  lending  and  the  economy  will  not  recover  if  the  banking  system  is 
inadequately  capitalised  and  suffering  from  excessive  leverage.  That  is  why  the  Bank  of 
England’s  Financial  Policy  Committee  has  placed  weight  on  the  need  for  the  weaker  UK 
banks to raise capital. It is not surprising that the more strongly capitalised banks in the UK 
are expanding lending and the poorly capitalised banks are contracting lending. 
Second, there are limits on the ability of domestic monetary policy to expand real demand in 
the face of the need for changes in the real equilibrium of the economy. I do not believe that 
the  present  problems  in  the  United  Kingdom  stem  only  from  a  large  negative  shock  to 
aggregate  demand.  In  common  with  many  other  countries,  our  problems  also  reflect  the 
underlying need to rebalance our economy, requiring a reallocation of resources both within 
and  between  nations.  It  is  not  simply  a  question  of  boosting  aggregate  demand,  but  of 
helping to bring about a shift to a new equilibrium. That in turn implies the need for both large 
changes in relative prices, especially between tradable and non-tradable goods and services, 
and  a  shift  in  the  relative  levels  of  domestic  demand  at  home  and  overseas.  There  are, 
therefore, limits on what any one country’s domestic monetary policies can achieve without 
the support of others. 
Despite  these  limits,  circumstances  have  demanded  that  central  banks  take  extraordinary 
measures. Such measures can risk moving into territory more normally associated with fiscal 
policy and, in doing so, put at risk their hard-won independence. There are, it seems to me, 
three threats to central bank independence. 
First, there is the risk of appearing to promise too much or allowing too much to be expected 
of us. With constraints on other policy instruments, central banks are seen as “the only game

Scheme,  Extended  Collateral  Term  Repos,  Extended  Collateral  Long  Term  Repos,  and  the  Funding  for 
Lending Scheme. The ECB initiated its Long Term Repo Operations. And Federal Reserve facilities include

in  town”.  But  failure  to  make  clear  the  limits  to  monetary  policy  risks  disillusionment  with 
central banks and the inevitable political pressure on them that would follow. 
Second, at the zero lower bound there is no clear distinction between monetary and fiscal 
policy.  But  it  is  still  important  to  ensure  that  central  banks do  not  take  on  to  their  balance 
sheets  risks  to  the  taxpayer  that  are  properly  matters  that  should  be  decided  by  elected 
politicians.  To  ensure  price  stability  in  the  long  run  it  is  vital  to  maintain  the  operational 
independence  of  a  central  bank.  Any  decisions  that  put  taxpayers’  money  at  risk  must  be 
made by finance ministries, and central banks must protect their balance sheets by imposing 
appropriate haircuts on collateral, and avoiding the purchase of risky private-sector assets.  
Third, and important even when we move away from the zero lower bound, the expansion of 
central bank responsibilities to include macroprudential policy and, in the case of the Bank of 
England,  responsibility  for  regulating  the  banking  system,  has  made  independence  much 
harder  to  define.  The  deployment  of  responsibilities  outside  monetary  policy  cannot  be 
divorced  from  the  government  in  the  same  way  as  is  possible  for  monetary  policy.  For 
example, in the area of financial stability and banking supervision, there will be times when 
public  funds  may  be  put  at  risk  when  rescuing  or  resolving  a  failing  institution  –  and  that 
decision  is  properly  one  for  the  finance  ministry.  It  is  far  from  straightforward  for  a  central 
bank  governor  to  be  completely  independent  in  terms  of  monetary  policy,  somewhat 
independent in terms of financial stability, and not at all independent in terms of operations 
that risk taxpayers’ money.  
The  financial  crisis  has  challenged  our  understanding  of  the  objectives  of  monetary  policy 
and exposed its limits. And, through the proliferation of instruments and resulting increase in 
responsibilities,  it  has  complicated  the  question  of  central  bank  independence.  So  how 
should  we  respond  to  this  more  complex  environment?  We  must  keep  sight  of  three 
important principles. First, although they should be realistic about what can be achieved, it is 
right that elected politicians and parliaments decide on the objectives of policy. Second, as 
we learned in the 1970s, if the central bank is to achieve price stability – its fundamental role 
–  it  must  be  sufficiently  independent.  And  third,  in  order  to  protect  that  independence,  its 
limits  should  be  very  clearly  circumscribed,  and  we  should  be  exceptionally  careful  with 
decisions that put public funds at risk.  
The challenge remains, as it was twenty years ago, to make “constrained discretion” work in 
practice. But it has got harder.
