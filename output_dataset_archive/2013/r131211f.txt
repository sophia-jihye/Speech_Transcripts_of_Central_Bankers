Carlos da Silva Costa: Sustained growth and development of the 
Portuguese economy 
Address  by  Mr  Carlos  da  Silva  Costa,  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Portugal,  at  the  National 
Congress of Economists, Lisbon, 8 October 2013. 
 Prime  Minister,  President  of  the  Portuguese  Economists’  Association,  ambassadors, 
colleagues: 
It is a privilege to take part in the opening of this Conference for two reasons. First, because 
it is promoted by the professional association to which I belong. Second, due to the close 
relationship  of  cooperation  that  there  is  between  Banco  de  Portugal  and  the  Association, 
which  involves  the  co-hosting  of  conferences,  reflecting  recognition  of  the  benefits  of  a 
shared understanding on topics that concern us. 
The  thoughts  I  would  like  to  share  with  you  today  have  the  following  theme:  “Sustained 
growth and development of the Portuguese economy”. We are now less than a year from 
the  end  of  the  Economic  and  Financial  Assistance  Programme  (EFAP)  and  it  is  now 
important to look to the future. Bearing in mind that today the great majority of the colleagues 
here present work (and work well) in roles as company economists, I propose to approach 
this topic by drawing parallels with corporate management. 
Indeed, the questions that arise in managing a company are the same as those we should 
ask as a country: 
 
 
 
 
Both at national and at corporate level, collective motivation is always necessary to achieve 
our goals. 
My presentation is structured around four points. The first – the macroeconomic adjustment – 
aims to answer the question: Where are we? The second – medium-term challenges for the 
Portuguese economy – approaches the question: Where do we want to go? The third and 
fourth  points  of  the  presentation  –  structural  transformation  of  the  Portuguese  business 
sector and a demand-led national system of innovation – mainly answer the question: What 
is our strategy for getting there? The question “How should we organise ourselves?” is not 
explored in this address, as it is a topic I tackled in prior addresses, namely in the SEDES 
conference on 19 March and at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation on 24 May.1

The macroeconomic adjustment

Where are we? 
We  are  in  the  process  of  adjusting  macroeconomic  imbalances  that  led  us  to  an  absolute 
financial restriction, in the form of a situation in which we would have ceased external and

domestic  payments  were  it  not  for  the  assistance  of  international  institutions.  We  have 
embarked on an adjustment process through a contractual relationship with those who came 
to our assistance. 
At  corporate  level,  this  situation  is  analogous  to  what  happens  when  a  company  falls  into 
difficulties and has to negotiate a restructuring plan with the bank. There are conditions and 
targets  to  fulfil  that  form  part  of  the  relationship  of  trust  between  the  party  supplying  the 
financial assistance and the party receiving it. 
We are making an adjustment under very different conditions from those in force in previous 
financial  assistance  programmes,  in  1977  and  1983,  both  in  terms  of  the  institutional 
framework of macroeconomic policy and in terms of the productive and financial structures. 
But the greatest difference arises from the starting point, which is far more unfavourable in 
the recent case. 
Aside  from  this,  the  external  imbalance  adjusted  in  line  with  that  observed  in  previous 
programmes (Figure 1). This development is notable, as it took place without recourse to the 
nominal  devaluation  of  the  exchange  rate  and  with  fairly  low  growth  in  external  demand. 
Although exports did not grow as much as in previous adjustment episodes, they increased 
market shares. I emphasise here the effort made by Portuguese companies in the tradable 
sector (including tourism) in incremental penetration in the markets and in redirecting supply 
to new markets. In addition, the performance of the effective real exchange rate shows that 
even in the absence of a nominal exchange rate devaluation, the Portuguese economy has 
shown the flexibility needed to adjust through variation of the relative unit labour costs. This 
is  an  important  accomplishment  for  Europe  as  a  whole,  as  it  proves  that  it  is  possible  to 
make an adjustment in a single currency context.

The behaviour of the external component was not enough however to offset the impact on 
GDP of the contraction in domestic spending. Indeed, domestic spending fell more than in 
previous  programmes,  with  the  clearest  difference  appearing  in  the  behaviour  of  private 
consumption (Figure 2). The current significant reduction in household spending reflects the 
contraction of disposable income, the impact of the restrictions on access to credit and the 
effect  of  high  indebtedness  on  the  ability  to  smooth  consumption.  Furthermore,  the 
disappearance of the money illusion has contributed to a downward revision in expectations 
of private agents’ permanent income, which has accelerated and amplified the impact of the 
policy measures on domestic spending. Indeed, in previous adjustments, the money illusion 
has allowed a great, silent redistribution of wealth: the holders of monetary assets and those 
with fixed incomes lost purchasing power, but as nominal income rose, they did not notice 
right away – and far less anticipated – the loss in real terms. In a “numb” process of this kind, 
the reaction of private demand tends to be less intense and immediate than in a process in 
which the general public observe that their income is falling. And so it is not surprising that in 
the current context, the multipliers – which are a measure of the conversion of a stimulus into 
an effect – are larger than expected initially. The perception of the more permanent nature of 
the adjustment is also visible in the behaviour of the saving rate, which increased more than 
in the 1977 and 1983 adjustments. 
The  strong  contraction  in  domestic  demand,  along  with  the  adjustment  of  the  previous 
imbalance in the productive structure – oversized non-tradable sector relative to the tradable 
sector – resulted in a more marked increase in unemployment. A very significant proportion 
of  unemployment  is  structural  in  nature,  given  the  size  and  lasting  nature  of  the  fall  in 
demand affecting various non-tradable sectors, such as property and construction.

The fiscal adjustment of 2010–2012 compares well with that of 1983–1985 (Figure 3). The 
structural  primary  balance  of  general  government  in  2010–2012  improved  7  p.p.  of  GDP, 
which is notable by any international comparison.

One important point that should be recognised is that our adjustment has taken place in a 
context of headwinds. During the adjustment period, conditions external to the Portuguese 
economy have deteriorated, with external demand falling short of initial expectations. By way 
of example, a macroeconomic scenario in which external demand evolved as was expected 
at the start of the Programme, GDP variation would be marginally positive already in 2013, 
the  fiscal  deficit  would  be  below  5  per  cent  in  2013,  public  debt  would  be  stabilising  and 
employment would be around 1.5 p.p. above that observed over the last three years (Chart 
1). An adjustment with headwinds is always more onerous and can undermine the credibility 
of  the  fiscal  consolidation  process  when  the  goals  are  set  in  terms  of  GDP  ratio.  The 
variables in the ratio suffer the adverse effect of factors that cannot be controlled by fiscal 
policy-makers, and may create the perception that the adjust failed. For this reason, I have 
maintained that the adjustment programmes’ fiscal goals should be set in the form of limits to 
nominal  public  spending,  goals  that  are  controllable  by  the  fiscal  policy-makers  and  that 
thereby allow a real assessment of the results achieved and the consequent accountability 
for failures. 
In contrast to the current situation, the adjustments of 1977 and 1983 benefited from certain 
tailwinds. With tailwinds, the fiscal adjustment becomes easier, as it receives a helpful nudge 
both from the fiscal revenues side and the GDP side, which also allows any slippage in terms 
of spending control to be offset.

 We  recently  completed  the  8th  and  9th  quarterly  reviews  under  the  Programme.  We  now 
have a short while until the Programme ends, during which we have to manage the return to 
the markets. Returning to the markets means refinancing the debt that matures during 2014 
and financing the additional needs of general government. To finance us, the markets need 
to  be  confident  about  the  sustainability  of  our  public  finances.  That  confidence  will  be 
assessed on the basis of three indicators: 1) fulfilment of the EFAP; 2) political commitment 
to maintaining a sustainable trajectory for public financing over time; and 3) determination in 
fulfilling our obligations (e.g. willingness to pay). 
In this regard, the message coming out of the country is very important. Public debt interest 
rates are currently inviting and, when public financing sustainability becomes credible, there 
will certainly be investors interested in Portuguese public debt and, as a result, we will see 
the spreads versus our European partners fall, as was the case in Ireland. 
Medium-term challenges for the Portuguese economy 
2. 
Where do we want to go? 
Portugal faces two tough medium-term challenges: 
 
 
I  distinguish  between  these  two  challenges  because  economic  growth  may  be  based  on 
productivity  increases,  thereby  coexisting  with  continuing  high  structural  unemployment 
levels. From my point of view, this is not a good equilibrium. Structural unemployment has 
personal and social costs that go far beyond lack of income, creating a corrosive effect on 
social cohesion. So we need to sustain growth in increased productivity and employment.

Absorbing the high level of structural unemployment

to  establish  or  strengthen  cohesion  mechanisms 
Public debt sustainability 
External debt sustainability 
Increased per capita income level 
Increased employment 
Indeed, sustained growth achieves four goals at the same time: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
The  reallocation  of  human  resources  between  the  non-tradable  sector  and  the  tradable 
sector is going to take time, requiring mechanisms to be strengthened or created to mitigate 
the effects of this adjustment on social cohesion. The process will be slower the less clear or 
more misaligned the incentives are from economic and social policy. It is up to society as a 
whole 
the  effects  of 
unemployment, namely the risk of social exclusion through lack of income. Furthermore, it is 
necessary  to  create  support  mechanisms  to  re-skill  the  long-term  unemployed,  to  prevent 
them  from  passing  into  inactivity,  through  obsolescence  of  the  knowledge  acquired 
previously.  Preferably,  re-skilling  and  the  acquisition  of  new  skills  takes  place  within 
companies. 
From the viewpoint of social cohesion, it is key to safeguard two aspects: firstly people must 
not be condemned to remain outside the labour market; and secondly the mechanisms for 
re-skilling  workers  must  be  efficient  and  the  employment  created  is  not  artificial  but 
economically sustainable. Similarly, a balance must be struck between the income support 
mechanisms and the stimulus for returning to the labour market. In other words, the income 
support mechanisms cannot disincentivise the recipient from returning to the labour market. 
To  address  these  challenges,  the  economy  must  be  capable  of  attracting  domestic  and 
foreign investment that is productive. The productive base for tradable goods and services 
must  be  strengthened  and  the  specialisation  level  in  the  Portuguese  economy  must  be 
improved, both in terms of sectors and in terms of product ranges. The support infrastructure 
and services are available, they just need to be made profitable.

Structural transformation of Portuguese companies 
3. 
What is our strategy for getting there? 
In my view, the strategy should be developed along four lines: 
1) 
2) 
3) 
4) 
Optimisation of the installed productive capacity utilisation 
Endogenous improvement of the intra-sectoral specialisation level 
Endogenous improvement of the inter-sectoral specialisation level 
Attraction of Foreign Direct Investment 
Optimisation of the installed productive capacity utilisation 
3.1. 
Optimisation  of  the  installed  productive  capacity  utilisation  means  taking  advantage  of  the 
investment  made  to-date,  increasing  production,  going  in  search  of  new  markets  and  new 
clients.  In  the  sectors  producing  tradable  goods,  it  is  essential  to  continue  redirecting 
production to external markets. In the services sector, installed capacity utilisation must be 
boosted through providing services to non-residents. In the tourism sector, an approach must 
be  designed  that  increases  the  density  of  supply  (that  is,  that  covers  the  various  market 
segments that are compatible with our production costs) and that ensures a high utilisation 
rate of installed capacity throughout the year. In parallel, deterioration must be avoided in the 
market segments where we are already present. Aside from tourism, greater advantage must 
be taken of increasing international mobility of individuals to boost sectors such as health, 
education and knowledge.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
In  this  regard,  we  must  prioritise  the  speedy  resolution  of  those  companies  that  are 
economically viable but are in financial litigation. Alternatives should be considered such as 
selling the company or transferring the management, to avoid losing the company’s social 
capital  which  is  far  more  important  than  the  financial  capital.  We  must  ensure  that  the 
mechanisms  in  place  for  recovering  companies  are  agile,  which  depends  greatly  on  the 
attitude of all those participating in the process. 
Endogenous improvement of the intra-sectoral specialisation level 
3.2. 
The  second  strategic  line  consists  of  endogenous  improvement  of  the  intra-sectoral 
specialisation  level,  through  absorption  of  so-called  “incremental  innovation”.  This  means 
that  we  have  to  evolve  upwards  to  higher  market  segments  in  the  sectors  where  we  are 
already present. The footwear sector is a good example of success in this regard. This sector 
made a notable change in its place on the value chain, progressing to higher segments and 
today is very near the top of the market segments. 
To put this strategy into practice, it is critical that companies have capacity to increase their 
scale  and  take  advantage  of  new  knowledge  and  qualifications  in  terms  of  products  and 
production  processes.  In  other  words  they  need  the  capacity  to  absorb  incremental 
innovation. 
Indeed there are various restrictions on growth for Portuguese companies – which operate 
like  a  kind  of  “glass  ceiling”.  To  start  with,  the  high  degree  of  leverage,  but  also  the  low 
quality  of  management,  which  translates  into  a  lack  of  strategy,  organisation  and 
endogenous capacity to keep up with the markets and innovation. 
In this respect, the following changes must urgently be made to Portuguese companies: 
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
e) 
f) 
These six transformation areas are interlinked. It is impossible to have a functionally complex 
organisation that is capable of absorbing knowledge and responding to the market without 
scale. The creation of a scale and growth dynamic involves the availability of funds, but also 
requires  professionalised  management  that  is  clearly  separated  from  ownership,  which  is 
capable of supplying transparent and reliable information to the different stakeholders. 
Creation of a scale dynamic – “larger SMEs” 
Strengthening of capital adequacy 
Strengthening of capacity for absorbing knowledge 
Strengthening of internal organisation 
Clear separation between ownership and management 
Professionalisation of management 
Creation of a scale dynamic 
With regard to companies’ scale, it is known that Portuguese companies are too fragmented. 
According  to  Eurostat  data,2  in  2010,  95  per  cent  of  non-financial  companies  employed 
between  one  and  nine  workers,  while  less  than  1  per  cent  employed  more  than  50.  This 
restriction limits the possibility of optimising processes, attracting qualified human resources 
and  asserting  companies  in  external  markets,  while  reducing  companies’  endogenous 
capacity  for  keeping  up  with  markets  and  technological  innovation.  In  short,  it  limits 
productivity gains. 
Various  empirical  findings  suggest that  the  differences  in scale  of  companies  between  the 
various  countries  are  related  to  the  differences  in  the  quality  of  their  social  capital.  For

example,  research  by  Bloom  et  al  (2009)  and  Garicano  (2000)3  show 
the 
countries/regions where mutual trust levels are highest typically have larger size companies. 
This  is  one  reason  behind  the  many  large  companies  in  the  USA  and  the  countries  of 
northern  Europe,  as  opposed  to  the  countries  of  southern  Europe  and  Asia  (India  for 
example),  where  companies  are  very  small.  Indeed,  the  opening  up  of  capital  and  the 
decentralisation of management, key conditions for the growth of companies, presupposes a 
relationship  of  trust.  As  is  known,  Portugal  is  part  of  the  group  of  countries  where  trust  is 
generally low. 
that 
Capital adequacy 
Portuguese companies have to increase their equity in order to grow. Portuguese companies 
generally  have  very  low  levels  of  capital  adequacy.  According  to  data  from  Banco  de 
Portugal’s  Central  Balance-Sheet  Database,  in  2012,  the  level  of  capital  adequacy  in 
non-financial  companies  was  36  per  cent  on  average,  and  over  half  had  levels  below 
25 per cent (Table 2). Capital adequacy is very similar among companies of different sizes 
(micro, SMEs and large enterprises) and also between companies of different sectors (only 
holding  companies  have  a  higher  capital  adequacy).  Also,  in  2012,  interest’s  share  of 
cashflow  was  on  average  above  60  per  cent  (and  above  10  per  cent  for  over  half  of  all 
companies),  and  more  than  half  of  Portuguese  companies  had  a  debt/EBITDA  ratio 
above 3.5.

Portuguese companies’ high leverage ratios, when compared to those of companies in most 
mainland  European  countries,  lead  to  a  double  fragility  among  our  companies:  financial 
fragility, as companies are particularly vulnerable to alterations in financing conditions, both

in  terms  of  volume  and  cost;  and  strategic  fragility,  given  that  the  high  leverage  of 
Portuguese companies is inconsistent with investing in their sustained growth. It is therefore 
vital to develop financial instruments for boosting capital adequacy and define an economic 
policy framework, in particular on the fiscal side, which encourages interest in opening and 
increasing equity in companies. 
Quality of management and separation between ownership and management 
In the last few years, several international studies have quantitatively assessed the quality of 
management of companies in various countries. The results confirm that in Portugal’s case 
companies are badly managed on average. For example, Bloom et al (2012)4 conclude that 
the  US  scores  highest  on  average  in  terms  of  business  practice,  followed  by  Japan  and 
Germany; the lower part of the ranking features countries from southern Europe – Greece 
and Portugal – and developing countries, like Brazil, China and India. The study also shows 
that  in  the  case  of  Greece  and  Portugal,  there  is  significant  dispersion  in  the  quality  of 
management of companies, with a particularly high percentage of badly managed companies 
(the distribution has a “long tail”). 
The other result of this study that I would like to bring out is that in all the countries analysed, 
the  companies  managed  by  the  founders  or  their  direct  descendents  tend  to  be  badly 
managed.  In  family  firms,  there  is  a  deterioration  in  the  quality  of  management  when  it 
passes from the founder to the second generation and from the second to the third. When it 
reaches  the  third  generation,  there  is  a  high  chance  of  it  entering  into  an  entropic 
phenomenon, due to lack of leadership, management disputes or even income disputes. 
These  results  clearly  show  the  need  for  professionalising  management  in  Portuguese 
companies and separating management from ownership. To this end, mechanisms must be 
found  that  facilitate  the  transmission  of  companies  between  heirs  or  to  third  parties,  for 
example through management buy-out operations (MBOs). 
Endogenous improvement of the inter-sectoral specialisation level 
3.3 
Sectoral diversification is another key line for the success of our sustained growth strategy. It 
relates to the development of new products and new technologies, through the absorption of 
radical  innovation.  Indeed,  radical  innovation  has  the  capacity  to  change  business 
opportunities completely. 
Research  and  development  activities  often  create  an  individual  with  “an  idea”.  But  for  the 
idea  to  then  lead  on  to  the  creation/launch  of  new  companies,  an  “entrepreneur”  and  a 
“financial backer” must be found. And to increase the likelihood of the project succeeding, 
“management  and  organisational  capacity”  must  be  sourced.  In  fact,  how  ever  similar  the 
birth  rate  of  new  companies  in  Portugal  is  to  our  European  partners,  their  success  rate  is 
much lower. 
First and foremost, this strategy requires the development of a culture in which whoever has 
an idea trusts someone else to promote it. An institutional framework that guarantees rights 
of ownership and that promotes trust between individuals is therefore an essential condition. 
On  the  other  hand,  it  is  necessary  to  promote  entrepreneurial  capability.  Entrepreneurship 
does not invent itself overnight, it depends on history, education, a culture of innovation and 
risk,  as  well  as  a  responsive  attitude  and  one  of  adapting  to  the  challenges  of 
competitiveness.  So  we  have  to  encourage  an  institutional  framework  that  favours 
entrepreneurship. Where there is no strong entrepreneurial capability, it has to be created, 
for  example,  through  creating  forums  for  presenting  business  ideas  to  potential  investors 
(business angels, seed forum).

It is also not easy to find investors ready to finance innovative firms based on knowledge at a 
start-up phase. In the case of radical innovation, the results are highly uncertain and normally 
involve long maturing periods before bearing fruit. While incremental innovation is normally 
capable  of  obtaining  bank  financing,  traditional  banking  does  not  task  itself  with  financing 
radical innovation. 
Thus  new  forms  of  financing  must  be  encouraged  and  alternative  financial  instruments 
developed, including seed capital and risk capital. 
Attracting Foreign Direct Investment 
3.4 
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) offers benefits to the recipient country which go far beyond 
the  direct  effects  on  production  and  employment.  Typically,  FDI  involves  transferring 
technology, introducing new management skills and corporate culture techniques, enabling 
change  in  the  countries’  productive  base  and  among  their  institutional  frameworks.  This 
means that we have to create conditions that make the Portuguese economy an attractive 
place to invest and work. 
The  question  that  arises  is:  what  are  the  conditions  that  attract  international  production 
factors? 
There  are  many  studies  (theoretical  and  empirical)  which  investigate  the  reasons  why  the 
flow of capital from developed countries to developing countries is relatively limited, despite 
the  latter  having  lower  per  worker  capital  levels  –  called  the  “Lucas  Paradox”.  The  main 
findings  from  this  research  link  explanations  to  differences  in  fundamentals  that  affect  the 
poorer economies’ productive base, such as the quality of human capital, macroeconomic, 
regulatory  and  fiscal  stability  and  the  quality  of  institutions.  Thus  the  prerequisites  for 
attracting  FDI  include  investment  in  professional  education  and  training,  stability  and 
reliability and a good institutional framework. 
Quality of human capital 
Investment in education and human capital is key as a source of economic growth and an 
explanatory  factor  of  the  differences  across  countries  in  terms  of  growth  trends  and  per 
capita income. This result is robust for various theoretical approaches to economic growth, 
but is also robust to a multitude of empirical approaches based on a variety of methodologies 
and samples. 
In reality, it is easy to understand that more qualified workers are more productive. Education 
facilitates the transmission of the knowledge necessary for adopting new working methods 
and  new  technologies,  but  education  also  increases  an  economy’s  capacity  for  innovation 
through developing new ideas. 
Stability and reliability 
Investment is inter-temporal, requiring high trust and reliability levels. According to the World 
Economic  Forum’s  recent  global  competitiveness  report  for  2013–2014,  Portugal  fell  from 
49th to 51st place among 148 countries. Macroeconomic instability, loss of trust in politicians 
and the government and difficulty in accessing finance contributed significantly to this fall. 
We have to be aware that uncertainty is one of the main inhibitors of investment in Portugal. 
We  cannot  control  the  conditions  that  result  from  demand,  but  we  should  ensure  that  the 
macroeconomic, legislative, regulatory and fiscal frameworks are stable. Stability encourages 
both more investment and higher quality investment. 
Quality of institutions 
In the last few years, a considerable amount of economic literature has emphasised the role 
of quality institutions in the economic growth and development of different countries. Indeed, 
the framework of values, standards and institutions – called “social capital” in the literature –

has  a  key  role  in  economic  development,  as  it  boosts  the  productive  impact  of  physical 
capital,  the  qualification  of  the  labour  force  and  the  accumulation  of  technical  and 
organisational knowledge. This framework includes the laws that sustain the rule of law and 
ensure  rights  of  ownership,  but  also  those  that  define  the  political  institutions  and  the 
interaction between social partners. 
The  framework  of  values,  standards  and  institutions  influences  the  trust  underpinning 
economic agents’ interactions and the security levels governing the relationships with third 
parties. This means that that framework governs the way the economy functions and also the 
incentives that motivate individuals. When there is no trust, transactions do not take place. 
An  OECD  study  from  2011  shows  that  mutual  confidence  is  larger  in  the  richer  countries 
where  there  are  fewer  inequalities  in  the  distribution  of  income.  The  countries  of  northern 
Europe are those with the highest levels of trust. 
A  good  institutional  framework  is  generally  synonymous  with  a  transparent  and  impartial 
legal  environment,  which  protects  ownership  rights,  with  low  corruption  levels  and  public 
services  providing  equitable  conditions  for  all,  while  individuals  participate  in  the  activities 
that best suit their skills and abilities. Thus, the introduction of improvements to the legal and 
judicial systems, in executing contracts or adopting laws that establish compulsory education 
are  examples  of  areas  in  which  significant  gains  in  terms  of  growth  potential  can  be 
achieved. 
A  recent  Banco  de  Portugal  study  (Júlio,  Alves  e  Tavares,  2013)5  suggests  that 
improvements  in  institutional  performance  in  Portugal,  involving  convergence  to  European 
best practice, could increase FDI into Portugal by around 60 per cent. 
Demand-led national innovation system 
4. 
The  success  of  the  Portuguese  economy’s  tradable  goods  and  services  sector  depends 
greatly  on  its  ability  to  absorb  and  take  advantage  of  innovation.  But  taking  advantage  of 
innovation  depends  on  the  endogenous  entrepreneurial  capacity  and  the  FDI  that  we  are 
able to attract, which in turn, depend on the framework of values, attitudes and behaviours 
and the quality of the national innovation system’s governance and performance. 
The national innovation system comprises the centres producing knowledge, education and 
professional  training.  This  system  conditions  the  economy’s  specialisation  level  and,  in 
particular, productivity and innovation, both incremental and radical. That is why it has to be 
designed and channelled according to the productive system’s present and future needs and 
has to be able to detect those needs and collaborate with the corporate base. 
Portugal  has  to  change  the  national  innovation  system  to  a  demand-led  approach, 
responding to the needs of the national productive system. A competitive economy’s national 
innovation system must be governed by the present and future needs of its productive base. 
To conclude, it is worth looking at the result of an analysis conducted by Banco de Portugal 
on the relative performance of the companies investing in R&D in Portugal. Irrespective of 
the causality relationship, it is clear that the companies investing in R&D perform better in 
terms of exports, profitability and risk perception on the part of the banking system (Figure 4).
