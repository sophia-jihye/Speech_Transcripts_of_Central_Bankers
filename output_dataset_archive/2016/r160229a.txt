  Mark Carney: Redeeming an unforgiving world 
Remarks  by  Mr  Mark  Carney,  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  England  and  Chairman  of  the 
Financial Stability Board, at the 8th Annual Institute of International Finance G20 conference, 
Shanghai, 26 February 2016. 
 The global economy risks becoming trapped in a low growth, low inflation, low interest rate 
equilibrium.  For  the  past  seven  years,  growth  has  serially  disappointed  –  sometimes 
spectacularly, as in the depths of the global financial and euro crises; more often than not 
grindingly as past debts weigh on activity (Chart 1).   
This underperformance is principally the product of weaker potential supply growth in virtually 
all  G20  economies.1  It  is  a  reminder  that  demand  stimulus  on  its  own  can  do  little  to 
counteract longer-term forces of demographic change and productivity growth.

That  is  not  to  suggest  that  such  stimulus  is  without  value  or  impact.  Accommodative 
monetary policy can support activity while parts of the economy delever. Monetary stimulus 
can avoid hysteresis in the labour market. And monetary stimulus can buy time for structural 
adjustments which shift activity from public to private, external to domestic, and declining to 
rising sectors.  
The time purchased by stimulus has been well spent fixing the fault lines which caused the 
global financial crisis. Derivative markets have been made simpler and safer. Fragile shadow 
                                                
1  The IMF has downgraded their growth forecast for the fifth consecutive year; and now expects global growth 
to  be  around  3 ½%  in  2016  and  2017.  In  part,  this  reflects  a  reduction  in  the  IMF’s  assessment  of  global 
potential growth to below the around 4% average growth rate in the decade prior to the crisis. At the Bank of 
England, our protections are slightly weaker still. We expect PPP-weighted global growth this year to be just 
3.0%, a quarter of a point lower than our estimate for 2015.

   banking  activities  are  being  transformed  into  stronger  market-based  finance.  And  the 
scourge of too-big-to-fail is ending.2 
Most  notably,  a  more  resilient  global  banking  system  is  being  built.  The  dog  that  hasn’t 
barked  in  recent  months  has  been  financial  distress  at  the  core.  This  means  banks  are 
poised to dampen rather than amplify the impact on households and businesses of recent 
global financial shocks.  
Monetary  stimulus  has  also  made  room  for  the  repair  –  if  not  yet  the  completion  –  of 
European Monetary Union. Over the past year, euro-area growth has broadened, though in 
the ECB’s judgment, it has not yet strengthened to a degree consistent with its price stability 
objective let alone the expectations of Europe’s citizens.  
More fundamentally, global growth has disappointed because the innovation and ambition of 
global monetary policy has not been matched by structural measures. 
In most advanced economies, difficult structural reforms have been deferred. In parallel, in a 
number of emerging market economies, the post-crisis period was marked by credit booms 
reinforced by foreign capital inflows, which are now brutally reversing (Charts 2 and 3). The 
international  financial  and  monetary  architecture  has  been  tinkered  with  rather  than 
transformed. With the forces of fragmentation now rising in many countries, it will be more 
challenging  to  build  a  truly  open,  global  system.  The  consequences  of  such  timidity  are 
reflected in the sizeable downside risks which currently plague the global outlook.

 These shortcomings also explain much of the sharp fall in global nominal growth since the 
crisis. Since 2007, global nominal GDP growth (in dollars) has been cut in half from over 8% 
to  4%  last  year,  thereby  compounding  the  challenges  of  private  and  public  deleveraging 
(Table 1). In an unforgiving global environment even those economies with resilient private 
demand, like the UK, must manage policy with vigilance and dexterity.

Renewed  appreciation  of  the  weak  global  outlook  appears  to  have  been  the  underlying 
cause of recent market turbulence. The latest freefall in commodity prices – though largely 
the  product  of  actual  and  potential  supply  increases  –  has  reinforced  concerns  about  the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 3 
  sluggishness  of  global  demand.  And  a  series  of  relatively  small  data  disappointments  for 
many major G20 economies have added to these worries.  
Necessary  changes  in  the  stance  of  monetary policy  removed  the  complacent  assumption 
that  “all  bad  news  is  good  news”  (because  it  brought  renewed  stimulus)  that  many  felt 
underpinned markets. 
And  as  I  will  discuss  in  a  moment,  several  commentators  are  peddling  the  myth  that 
monetary policy is “out of ammunition.” Is “the only game in town” over? 
As  a  consequence  of  these  developments,  investors  are  now  re-considering  whether  the 
past seven years have been well spent. Has exceptional monetary policy merely bridged two 
low-growth equilibria? Or, even worse, has it been a pier, leaving the global economy facing 
a  global  liquidity  trap?  Can  more  time  be  purchased?  If  so,  at  what  cost  and,  most 
importantly, how would that time be best spent? 
These are the questions we should address during China’s G20 Presidency. They must be 
met with a response that matches the ambition and pragmatism of our hosts across financial 
reform, monetary policy and structural initiatives. 
Recent market turbulence 
Since  the  start  of  the  year,  risk  sentiment  in  financial  markets  has  deteriorated  sharply, 
stemming  in  large  part  from  a  renewed  appreciation  of  weak  medium-term  global  growth 
prospects accompanied by marked downside risks.  
Despite a recent recovery, equity markets are still down materially since the start of the year. 
Volatility has spilled over into corporate bond markets with US high-yield spreads at levels 
last seen during the euro-area crisis. The default rate implied by the US high-yield CDX index 
is  more  than  double  its  long-run  average.  And  sterling  and  US  dollar  investment  grade 
corporate bond spreads are more than 75bp higher over the past year. 
On  the  back  of  these  concerns,  risk  premia  have  increased  across  the  board,  with  “safe 
haven” assets and currencies benefitting at the expense of equities, credit and commodities. 
In this ‘risk off’ environment, correlations across asset classes are up sharply.  
Falls in market liquidity have contributed to strains in some markets. In treasuries and gilts, 
spreads between 30-year yields and the equivalent swaps have risen by over 40 basis points 
since the beginning of 2015. And there has been a widening in the spread between corporate 
bond yields and CDS premia which may reflect a reduction in arbitrage as dealers conserve 
their balance sheets. 
Banking stocks have been particularly hard hit, down about a quarter on average over the 
past  three  months,  across  the  advanced  economies,  prompting  some  to  question  whether 
anything  has  really  changed  (Chart  5).  This  re-pricing  likely  reflects  first  and  foremost 
renewed growth worries. Banks have always been high beta to the economy.

More fundamentally, banks are out of favour because of a new-found exasperation with their 
returns rather than due to old concerns about their resilience.  
UK  banks,  for  example,  have  seen  a  sharp  decline  in  profitability  since  the  crisis,  with 
average group-level post-tax returns on equity falling from 17% in 2006 to 6% in the first half 
of 2015 (Chart 6). Of course, with hindsight, a substantial proportion of the pre-crisis return 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  was  ephemeral,  reliant  on  short-term  funding,  capital-light  balance  sheets  and  massive 
synthetic leverage.   
Banks are facing continuing pressures on their business models from a number of sources, 
including:   
• 
The  consequences  of  a  low  growth,  low  rates  environment  with  ongoing  private 
deleveraging; 
The impact of a new regulatory framework designed to fix the fault lines that caused 
the crisis; and  
The effect of determined progress on removing the implicit public subsidy of Too-
Big-To-Fail.  
  Finally,  some  residual  concerns  about  regulatory  uncertainty,  particularly  in  the  euro  area, 
may  have  been  secondary  reinforcements  to  the  macroeconomic  drivers  of  recent  market 
turbulence.  
Financial reform and the state of the financial system  
However, this is not 2008. 
The  largest  cross-border  banks  are  considerably  stronger  than  during  prior  episodes  of 
market stress. Common equity requirements are seven times the pre-crisis standard for most 
banks.  For  global  systemically  important  banks  (G-SIBs),  they  are  more  than  ten  times 
higher.  Global  standards  require  banks  to  hold  much  higher  liquid  asset  buffers,  to 
strengthen  their  trading  books,  and  to  reduce  and  simplify  the  formerly  complex  web  of 
interbank exposures.  
In  response,  banks  have  built  higher  and  better  quality  capital  buffers  (Chart  7),  largely 
through retained earnings, and have reduced leverage. Between 2008 and 2015, advanced 
economy G-SIBs raised close to $800bn of equity, while almost $200bn was raised by major 
UK banks, over a period during which these banks’ risk-weighted assets fell. It is expected 
that the aggregate common equity tier one ratio across all G-SIBs, as calculated on the basis 
of the fully-loaded Basel III requirements, was more than 11% at end-2015, double the ratio 
in  2009.  In  parallel,  authorities  have  tightened  both  the  definition  of  total  capital  and  the 
requirements on trading activities. 
Bank  funding  profiles  have  also  improved  since  the  crisis.  For  UK  banks,  liquid  asset 
holdings  have  tripled to £500bn  and, for  the  system  as  a  whole,  customer  loan  books  are 
now entirely funded by customer deposits – up from around 75%. Trading assets are down 
by a third and inter-bank exposures have shrunk by two thirds.  
Moreover,  in  the  United  Kingdom,  banks  have  already  been  stress  tested  to  ensure  they 
have enough capital to cover two severe scenarios: a hard landing in emerging markets, and 
a UK balance of payments shock.

Policymakers can help banks transition to more sustainable business models by giving the 
maximum regulatory clarity. With the agreements reached in recent years, including Basel III 
and  the  global  agreement  on  Total  Loss  Absorbing  Capacity,  the  overall  international 
regulatory and resolution framework for banks is now largely settled. 
The  FSB,  Basel  Committee  and  other  authorities  now  need  to  build  confidence  about  the 
stability  of  the  overall  requirements,  deliver  transparency  about  the  extent  to  which 
institutions meet them, and fix some important remaining details.3 
For  example,  the  Basel  Committee  is  continuing  to  work  on  elements  of  the  Basel  III 
framework  to  ensure  its  overall  coherence  and  maximise  its  effectiveness.    In  doing  so, 
authorities are focused on not significantly increasing overall capital requirements across the 
banking sector.  
In short, there will be no Basel IV.  
Monetary policy 
By making the banking system substantially stronger, financial reform has made monetary 
policy more effective.  
That  is  essential  because  the  force  of  the  headwinds  facing  monetary  policy  are  leading 
some  to  claim  central  banks  are  out  of  monetary  ammunition.  This  is  wrong,  but  the 
widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed. 
A set of powerful forces, both secular and cyclical, have depressed ‘equilibrium’ interest rates 
globally.  These  forces  include  demographic  change,  slower  potential  growth,  higher  credit 
spreads, lower desired investment, a lower relative price of capital, greater income inequality, 
sustained private deleveraging and lower public investment.

  Together these dynamics have raised desired savings and lowered desired investment.  With 
more  savings  chasing  fewer  investment  opportunities,  equilibrium  safe  returns  have  fallen 
sharply  towards  zero  (Chart  8  –  see  also  Annex).  Colleagues  at  the  Bank  of  England 
estimate that these factors can explain around 400 of the 450 basis points fall in global long-
term equilibrium rates since the 1980s.4 The persistence of many of these trends suggests 
that the global neutral real rate could settle around 1% over the medium to long term. 
Chart 8 
Secular drivers pushing down on rates 
  
Why does that matter?  
Central banks must set their policy rates with regard to equilibrium interest rates in order to 
maintain  demand  growth  in  line  with  supply  growth  and  to  stabilise  inflation.  Setting  real 
interest  rates  substantially  above  the  equilibrium  rate  would,  in  time,  generate  rising 
unemployment and falling prices. The opposite is true of setting rates substantially below the 
equilibrium rate. The substantial variance of the equilibrium rate over time means that a 4% 
policy  rate  would  have  been  highly  stimulative  in  1980  but  would  be  highly  contractionary 
today.  
At the onset of the crisis, as households and firms sought to de-lever, the equilibrium rate fell 
sharply, calling for reductions of conventional policy rates to unprecedented levels.  
The  necessary  easing,  however,  went  well  beyond  what  central  banks  could  deliver  with 
short  rates  alone.  Unconventional  monetary  policy  measures, 
large-scale 
purchases  of  government  securities,  were  necessary  to  deliver  effective  market  rates 
negative  enough  to  mitigate  globally  deficient  demand.  In  the  UK,  forward  guidance 
supplemented  such  measures,  ensuring  households  and  firms  could  be  confident  that 
interest rates would not be raised prematurely, helping to secure the nascent recovery.

Paper No. 571.

  Central  banks  have  also  purchased  other  assets  –  in  some  cases  using  small-scale 
programmes to alleviate specific cases of market dysfunction, and, in others, larger ones to 
inject greater stimulus into the economy. 
By  deploying  a  broad  range  of  ammunition,  the  economy  has  been  stimulated  through  a 
number of channels.  
Lower policy rates brought forward consumption to today from spending tomorrow – the real 
interest rate channel.  
The all-in costs of borrowing were lowered, boosting existing borrowers’ spending power – 
the cash flow channel. And lower funding costs for banks increased the availability of credit 
– the credit channel. 
Lower  discount  rates  and  portfolio  balance  effects  supported  asset  prices  –  the  wealth 
channel.  
Currencies’ values fell, boosting competitiveness – the exchange rate channel.  
And  determined  central  bank  action  and  forward  guidance  put  a  floor  under  inflation 
expectations and bolstered sentiment – the confidence channel.  
In  this  way,  central  bank  actions  combatted  the  worst  global  downturn  since  the  Great 
Depression.  
All of these tools, and many variants of them, are still available to central banks if needed.  
With their arsenal well-stocked, the real questions for global reflation are how best to deploy 
these weapons and whether they will be reinforced by other policies. 
Low  interest  real  rates  have  bought  time  by  bringing  forward  demand  to  today  from 
tomorrow.5 But, to paraphrase my predecessor, Lord King, having brought forward demand 
for  years,  tomorrow  is  now  yesterday  (and  he  said  that  three  years  ago!).  In  other  words, 
most central banks need the other channels of monetary policy to work harder.  
The  scale  of  unconventional  measures  is  impressive.  Asset  purchase  programmes  have 
been extended, notably in the euro area and in Japan. The largest four central banks bought 
assets worth $1.2 trillion in 2015, similar to the amounts purchased post-Lehman and during 
the  2013  euro-area  crisis.  Adjusting  for  lower  government  debt  issuance,  that  leaves  an 
unprecedented flow of net QE, with only $400bn of additional government debt sold to the 
private sector, compared to $3 trillion in 2010 (Chart 9).

That volume has likely pushed down on the term premia demanded by investors when they 
lend  at  long  maturities  to  G4  governments,  reducing  the  cost  of  borrowing  for  firms  and 
households (Chart 10). In this regard, QE works through the credit and cash flow channels.

  However,  the  effect  of  QE  on  the  wealth  channel  cannot  last  forever.  Monetary  neutrality 
means real asset prices are not boosted indefinitely by such policies; their economic effects 
must ultimately unwind (Chart 11).

Said differently, unless an improvement in fundamentals boosts the underlying cash flows of 
these  assets,  real  valuations  will  fall  back.  That  structural  policies  have  not  boosted  real 
growth sufficiently is a better justification for the re-pricing in risk markets than any loss of 
confidence in the power of central banks. 
Central bank innovation has now extended to negative rates, with around a quarter of global 
output produced in economies where policy rates are literally through the floor.6 
Conceptually the more that effective policy rates can be reduced below equilibrium rates, the 
better  the  prospects  for  demand  to  grow  faster  than  potential  supply,  promoting  global 
reflation. 
However,  it  is  critical  that  stimulus  measures  are  structured  to  boost  domestic  demand, 
particularly from sectors of the economy with healthy balance sheets. There are limits to the 
extent to which negative rates can achieve this.  
For  example,  banks  might  not  pass  negative  policy  rates  fully  through  to  their  retail 
customers, shutting off the cash flow and credit channels and thereby limiting the boost to 
domestic  demand.7  That  is  associated  with  a  commonly  expressed  concern  that  negative 
rates reduce banks’ profitability.

In some cases household borrowing rates have actually risen.

  To be clear, monetary policy is conducted to achieve price stability not for the benefit of bank 
shareholders.   
Nonetheless,  when  negative  rates  are  implemented  in  ways  that  insulate  retail  customers, 
shutting  off  the  cash  flow  and  other  channels  that  mainly  affect  domestic  demand,  while 
allowing wholesale rates to adjust, their main effect is through the exchange rate channel.  
From  an  individual  country’s  perspective  this  might  be  an  attractive  route  to  boost  activity. 
But for the world as a whole, this export of excess saving and transfer of demand weakness 
elsewhere is ultimately a zero sum game.  Moreover, to the extent it pushes greater savings 
onto  the  global  markets,  global  short-term  equilibrium  rates  would  fall  further,  pulling  the 
global economy closer to a liquidity trap. At the global zero bound, there is no free lunch.8 
For monetary easing to work at a global level it cannot rely on simply moving scarce demand 
from  one  country  to  another.  Instead  policy  needs  to  increase  primarily  domestic  demand, 
with  the  exchange-rate  channel  more  a  side  effect  that  accompanies  any  monetary  policy 
action.  
In any given country, a monetary expansion aimed at boosting domestic demand will tend to 
reduce  effective  interest  rates9  relative  to  their  equilibrium  level,  generating  an  excess  of 
domestic  investment  over  domestic  saving  that  must  be  met  with  a  capital  inflow  from 
abroad.  
But viewed from overseas, the corresponding capital outflow will tend to raise the short-term 
equilibrium rate (Chart 12), giving conventional monetary policy overseas more traction.  
In this way, the rising tide of global demand would raise all boats.  
 
                                                
8  Svensson (2003), “Escaping from a Liquidity Trap and Deflation: The Foolproof Way and Others”, Journal of 
Economic  Perspectives, makes  the case  that  exchange  rate  intervention can  help  fight deflation in  a  small 
open economy. 
9  That is, interest rates adjusted for the effects of any quantitative or credit easing.

 Wider policy implications 
Ultimately, for  monetary  policy  at  the  zero  lower  bound to  bridge  to a  better  equilibrium,  it 
must  be  reinforced  by  other  policies.  That  is,  the  low  interest  rate  environment  puts  a 
premium on domestic and international policy coordination. For example, lower interest rates 
create space for fiscal policy to boost domestic demand directly, should it be necessary, by 
lowering the financing cost faced by governments.  
And it doesn’t take a genius to recognise that a prolonged period of low interest rates can 
lead  to  a  build-up  of  vulnerabilities  which  could  derail  an  expansion  and  deepen  a 
subsequent recession. 
This means macroprudential policy has an increasingly important role.  Rightly, the Chinese 
G20  Presidency  has  called  for  G20  members  to  learn  from  each  other’s  experience  of 
macroprudential management.  
The IMF, FSB and BIS will therefore report to G20 Leaders ahead of the Hangzhou Summit 
regarding  processes  to  analyse  systemic  risks;  toolkits  to  address  vulnerabilities;  and 
mechanisms for domestic and international coordination.  
In an increasingly integrated global financial system, this work can help identify areas where 
we need to work together to keep our systems resilient. It is clear, for example, that strong 
links exists between asset management in advanced economies and the debt markets relied 
upon by emerging market corporates.  
Where  appropriate,  the  FSB  will  make  policy  recommendations  regarding  structural 
vulnerabilities associated with asset management activities for public consultation before the 
14 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  Hangzhou Summit.  And reinforced by recent experience, the FSB’s second annual report on 
the  effects  of  reforms  will  include  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  extent,  drivers  and  likely 
persistence of any reduction in market liquidity. 
Whither the G20 Plan for strong, sustainable, balanced growth? 
Most fundamentally, the G20 needs to use the time purchased by monetary policy to develop 
a coherent and urgent approach to supply-side policies.   
Gradualism  in  structural  reforms  may  be  promoting  disinflationary  expectations,  while 
sapping the political process of its mandate. The weakness of investment not only holds back 
the supply side but also weighs on the equilibrium interest rate and further burdens monetary 
policy. 
At the Brisbane summit in 2014, the G20 leaders agreed an ambitious goal to lift the level of 
G20 GDP by at least two per cent by 2018.  
But  only  eighteen  months  on,  the  2  in  5  commitments  are  starting  to  look  more  like  the 
5/2 diet.   
Less than half of the measures have been implemented, and only around one third of the 
promised impact on global GDP has been delivered.  Moreover, whilst implementation has 
lagged, the need to boost growth has increased in size and urgency. The Bank of England 
projects the level of global GDP in 2018 to be over 3% below what the IMF expected at the 
time of the Brisbane summit. 
We need to live up to China’s G20 priorities. Structural reforms with a long-term focus but a 
short-term  implementation  horizon.  Determined  reform  of  the  global  architecture  for 
sustainable capital flows. The development of our essential macroprudential frameworks and 
the implementation of our financial reform commitments to address new vulnerabilities.  
These will allow monetary policies to fully bridge to a better future. 
Conclusion 
That  future  needs  the  arms  of  macro  policy  to  operate  in  close  concert,  domestically  and 
internationally.  Demand  stimulus  alone  will  not  sustainably  reflate  the  global  economy.  
Moreover, sustained low rates could strain the capacities of macroprudential policies. 
At  their roots, fiscal,  monetary, financial  and  structural  policies  are  deeply  complementary, 
operating through many of the same channels.  
A stronger financial system can better channel savings to investment, building demand in the 
short run and productivity in the long run. 
Monetary stimulus is more effective if, in a deflationary environment, other policies can also 
give households and firms the confidence that global reflation is in prospect.  
And structural reforms can boost long-run wealth allowing monetary policy to bring forward 
spending from future incomes that are real and not ephemeral.  
All must recognise the imperative of avoiding the global liquidity trap. 
Not to beggar-thyself via beggar-thy-neighbour. 
Not to obsess over process at the expense of productivity. 
But by building resilient domestic demand and sustainable cross border capital flows, we in 
the G20 can redeem an unforgiving world.
