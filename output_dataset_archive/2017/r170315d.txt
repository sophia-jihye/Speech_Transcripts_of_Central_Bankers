Economic and Financial Developments 
and Monetary Policy in Japan 
 Speech at a Seminar Hosted by the Embassy of Japan 
in Switzerland (Zurich) 
Takako Masai 
Member of the Policy Board 
Introduction 
It is a great honor to have the opportunity today to be invited to this seminar hosted by the 
Embassy  of  Japan  in  Switzerland,  and  to  exchange  views  with  such  a  distinguished 
gathering of people representing the economic and financial communities in Switzerland. 
 
Today,  I  will  first  touch  on  economic  and  financial  developments  in  Japan.  After  that,  I 
would like to explain the Bank of Japan's monetary policy and then share my views on the 
challenges and future for the economy.   
 
I. Economic and Financial Developments in Japan 
I will start by presenting my overview of the current economic and financial situation in 
Japan, in order to provide a broad picture. Then, I will give a summary of the latest Outlook 
for Economic Activity and Prices, or the Outlook Report, published in January 2017. The 
Outlook Report presents the Bank's assessment of the current situation and the outlook for 
economic activity and prices, and is published quarterly. 
 
A. My Overview of Economic and Financial Developments 
1. Household sector 
Favorable employment situation and household sentiment 
The current situation for Japan's economy is characterized by tight labor market conditions. 
The average unemployment rate for 2016 declined to 3.1 percent, a level close to so-called 
full  employment.  The  active  job  openings-to-applicants  ratio  for  2016  rose  to  about  1.4 
times on average, which is the highest level in 25 years. It has risen, for example, not only 
in metropolitan areas but also in all other regions (Chart 1).   
 
I believe that such a favorable employment situation undoubtedly has supported household 
sentiment.  Individuals  can  feel  great  confidence  when  they  do  not  need  to  be  concerned 
about  whether  their  wages  will  be  cut,  even  if  corporate  performance  underperforms  to 
some extent, or whether they can find another job. This sense of reassurance is crucial in 
Japan, where the mobility in the labor market is said to be relatively lower than in other 
countries.  Such  improvement  in  household  sentiment  can  be  seen,  for  instance,  in  the 
remarkable  improvement  in  the  Nippon  Research  Institute  (NRI)  Consumer  Sentiment 
1 
Index, which measures the outlook among consumers for financial conditions over the next 
one  year  from  now.  Looking  back  at  2016,  Japan's  economy  continually  faced  several 
destabilizing factors, such as the turbulence in global financial markets from early in the 
year and situations at home -- namely, the Kumamoto Earthquake and irregular weather in 
summer.  Despite  these  circumstances,  household  sentiment  showed  resilience.  I  consider 
that one of the factors of this is likely to have been the tightening of labor market conditions 
(Chart 2). 
 
Private consumption has shown some signs of improvement, driven by a moderate increase 
in employee income. 
On the back of tightening labor market conditions, a modest increase in employee income 
has been seen (Chart 3). In Japan, the action of increasing annual wage levels by revising 
the pay table is referred to as "base up." This is a general wage increase made across all 
employees, apart from wage increases due to promotion, based on age, and/or the number of 
working  years.  This  is  a  practice  that  was  introduced  during  the  rapid  economic  growth 
period. However, from the late 1990s, firms stepped up their efforts to contain labor costs. 
As  a  result,  most  firms  stopped  using  base  up  from  the  2000s.  Meanwhile,  in  the  wage 
negotiations in 2014 and thereafter, this practice has been widely resumed among firms for 
the first time in more than a decade. This year is the fourth one since such trends have been 
visible,  but  some  are  concerned  that  the  results  of  the  negotiations  this  year  would  be 
disappointing given that the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, 
all items less fresh food) has been slow to increase recently, due mainly to the fall in energy 
prices. Even so, now that employees' concerns are not over a wage cut, but rather how much 
wages will increase, we are at least heading in the right direction considering the fact that 
hardly anybody had talked about base up as an issue for nearly 20 years until a few years 
ago. 
 
Private  consumption  has  shown  some  signs  of  improvement  recently,  given  household 
sentiment  being  supported  and  improved  employee  income.  My  impression  is  that  a 
virtuous  cycle  from  income  to  spending  has  been  maintained  in  the  household  sector. 
However, there are the following points to consider: (1) wage increases are weak despite 
tightening  labor  market  conditions,  and  (2)  consumption  is  rather  lackluster  despite  the 
2 
steady  improvement  in  employee  income.  That  is  to  say,  consumption  has  shown  some 
signs of improvement but has lacked momentum. Therefore, the virtuous cycle from income 
to spending should become a little more promising. 
 
2. Corporate sector 
Corporate profits have been at record high levels, but firms have been taking a cautious 
view on the outlook. 
Corporate profits in Japan reached record highs from fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2015, and 
have  remained  at  high  levels  thereafter.  Under  these  circumstances,  business  fixed 
investment has been on a moderate uptrend, and the virtuous cycle from income to spending 
seems  to  be  maintained  in  the  corporate  sector  as  well.  That  being  said,  despite  the 
expansion in profits, it is true that the growth in business fixed investment is slower. As 
background  to  this,  it  has  been  pointed  out that  the  expansion  in corporate profits  in  the 
current  recovery  largely  owes  to  the  improvement  in  the  terms  of  trade  rather  than  the 
increase in sales volume, which tends to lead to a rise in growth expectations. As a result, 
the business fixed investment expansion was not strong enough.1  However, it also has been 
pointed out that, even if the increase in corporate profits was based on the improvement in 
the terms of trade, there would likely be a positive impact on business fixed investment if 
such  an  improving  trend  is  confirmed.  In  addition,  highly  accommodative  financial 
conditions  have  been  encouraging  firms  to  invest.  As  with  the  household  sector,  it  is 
important  to  raise  growth  expectations  to  further  reinforce  the  virtuous  cycle  in  the 
corporate sector. I will go into the details on this point later. 
 
The  stabilization  of  energy  prices  has  a  positive  impact  on  Japan's  economy.  The  high 
volatility of exchange rates, if it continues, can deteriorate business sentiment. 
Let me make two additional points with regard to the corporate sector. 
 
First, it is important to note that the outlook for energy prices, including crude oil prices, 
improved  since  late  2016  --  namely,  that  they  would  remain  stable.  This  should  have  a 
                                                   
1  For the background to firms' prolonged cautious fixed investment stance despite their profits at 
record  high  levels,  see  "Corporate  Profits  and  Business  Fixed  Investment:  Why  Are  Firms  So 
Cautious about Investment?," Bank of Japan Review Series, No. 2016-E-2, April 2016.

positive impact on the global economy as well as Japan's economy. Given this, my view is 
that the downside risks to the economy have been reduced compared to the second half of 
2016. 
 
Second, large swings in foreign exchange rates can be a cause for concern. Looking at the 
dollar/yen exchange rate fluctuations in 2016, volatility was a bit high and exchange rate 
levels fluctuated markedly up and down, with the yen appreciating roughly in the first half 
of the year and depreciating in the second half. Looking back, 2016 was a year in which 
there tended to be infrequent trading at around the yearly average exchange rate. I assume 
that these marked exchange rate fluctuations within a relatively short period have made it 
difficult  for  firms  to  steer  management.  I  believe  that  this  is  readily  imaginable  among 
people representing the economic and financial communities in Switzerland, which tend to 
be affected significantly by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as with Japan. There is 
concern that these kinds of large swings in the exchange rates, if they continue, might have 
a negative impact on business sentiment. 
 
So far, I have given a broad picture of Japan's economy. In short, both employee income 
and corporate profits have been increasing and the virtuous cycle from income to spending 
has been maintained both in the household and corporate sectors; however, more should be 
done to further strengthen it. Next, I will look more closely at the current situation and the 
outlook for Japan's economy by presenting the main contents of the latest Outlook Report. 
 
B. Current Situation and Outlook 
1. Current situation 
The Bank's assessment is that Japan's economy has continued its moderate recovery trend. 
On the domestic demand side, business fixed investment has been on a moderate uptrend as 
corporate profits have been at high levels and business sentiment has improved somewhat. 
Against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation, 
private consumption has been resilient, and housing investment has continued its pick-up. A 
rise in exports seems to have been even more persistent recently. Amid an improvement in 
business sentiment of manufacturing firms on a global basis, there is a steady rise in the 
number of items for which export volume increased, particularly backed by expansion in 
4 
IT-related demand and by inventory and capital stock adjustments in emerging economies. 
Industrial  production  has  shown  signs  of  improvement,  reflecting  these  developments  in 
demand both at home and abroad, as well as inventory adjustments. 
 
On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) 
has been at around 0 percent on the whole, as the negative contribution of energy prices 
that reflect past developments in crude oil prices and the positive contribution of prices 
other than energy largely offset each other. 
 
2. Outlook 
I  will  now  look  at  the  outlook  for  Japan's  economy  during  the  projection  period,  which 
covers from fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2018. The Bank's assessment is that Japan's economy 
is expected to turn to a moderate expansion. Domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend 
on the back of highly accommodative financial conditions and fiscal spending through the 
government's large-scale stimulus measures. Meanwhile, exports are expected to follow a 
moderate upward trend on the back of improvement in overseas economies. Reflecting this 
outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue growing at a pace above its potential through 
the projection period. Looking at the medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts in the 
January 2017 Outlook Report, the real GDP growth rate is projected to be 1.4 percent for 
fiscal 2016, 1.5 percent for fiscal 2017, and 1.1 percent for fiscal 2018 (Chart 4). 
 
Let me explain the outlook in detail by major component. As for business fixed investment, 
with  some time  lag,  the  past  slowdown  in emerging  economies  and  yen  appreciation  are 
likely  to  exert  downward  pressure  for  the  time  being,  mainly  in  manufacturing  firms. 
However, throughout the projection period, it is likely to continue to see a moderate uptrend. 
This is because, in a situation where extremely stimulative financial conditions -- such as 
low  interest  rates  and  accommodative  lending  attitudes  --  have  been  maintained,  fixed 
investment will be positively affected by the effects of fiscal measures including projects 
conducted  under  the  Fiscal  Investment  and  Loan  Program  and  tax  reductions  for  capital 
investment,  as  well  as  by  moderate  improvement  in  growth  expectations.  Moreover, 
corporate profits are projected to improve, but even if they become weaker than expected to 
some degree, business fixed investment is likely to be supported in particular by investment 
5 
(1)  in  redevelopment  projects  in  view  of  the  2020  Tokyo  Olympics,  (2)  in  research  and 
development for growth areas, (3) in labor-saving machinery and equipment in order to deal 
with  labor  shortages,  and  (4)  for  maintenance  and  replacement  of  equipment  to  address 
deterioration from aging. Private consumption is expected to increase moderately, supported 
by a steady improvement in employee income, as well as the wealth effects stemming from 
a rise in stock prices and the effects resulting from the set of stimulus measures. Housing 
investment is likely to continue improving. Exports will likely continue their pick-up trend 
for  the  time  being,  as  the  effects  of  the  slowdown  in  emerging  economies  wane,  and 
thereafter  are  projected  to  increase  moderately.  This  is  because  it  is  forecasted  that  the 
growth rate of the world trade volume will accelerate gradually with the further recovery in 
overseas economies, and that Japan's share of exports will increase moderately, due in part 
to a worldwide recovery in the sector of capital goods. Industrial production is projected to 
increase modestly, reflecting a rise in demand at home and abroad, with the effects of the 
slowdown  in  emerging  economies  waning  and  those  of  the  set  of  stimulus  measures 
becoming evident.   
 
As for prices, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely 
to increase from about 0 percent and become slightly positive, due mainly to the negative 
contribution  of  energy  prices  dissipating.  Thereafter,  it  is  expected  to  increase  toward  2 
percent as  the aggregate supply  and  demand  balance improves  and  inflation  expectations 
rise. Looking at the medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts in the January 2017 
Outlook  Report,  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI  (all  items  less  fresh  food)  is 
projected  to  be  minus  0.2  percent  for  fiscal  2016,  1.5  percent  for  fiscal  2017,  and  1.7 
percent for fiscal 2018 (Chart 4). 
 
II. The Bank's Monetary Policy 
Next, I will talk about the Bank's monetary policy. I would like to start with a brief review 
of  the  Bank's  monetary  policies,  which  have  been  conducted  in  various  unconventional 
ways for nearly 20 years. 
 
6 
A. The Bank's Monetary Policy under Deflation 
Japan's economy had been suffering from deflation for more than 15 years, since the late 
1990s, with the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI being about zero or slightly negative. 
Of  course,  the  Bank  did  not  merely  stand  by  during  that  period.  In  1998,  Japan's  policy 
interest rate -- which at that time was the uncollateralized overnight call rate -- already had 
been lowered to close to zero, at 0.25 percent. Given that economic activity and prices did 
not improve even in this situation, in February 1999, the Bank introduced a zero interest 
rate  policy,  and  in  April  of  that  year,  introduced  what  is  now  called  forward  guidance, 
stating that it would continue with the zero interest rate policy until deflationary concern is 
dispelled. Thereafter, in March 2001, it introduced a quantitative easing policy, in which the 
operating target was the outstanding balance of current accounts at the Bank. I would note 
that,  at  the  same  time,  the  Bank  introduced  forward  guidance  that  was  linked  to  the 
observed  CPI.  Later,  it  also  implemented  a  comprehensive  monetary  easing  policy  in 
October 2010, in which it purchased assets such as CP, corporate bonds, exchange-traded 
funds  (ETFs),  and  Japan  real  estate  investment  trusts  (J-REITs).  The  Bank  continues  to 
make  these  asset  purchases  to  the  present,  and  with  respect  to  ETFs  and  J-REITs,  it  has 
significantly increased the amount of purchases since 2013. Meanwhile, it also introduced 
the  Fund-Provisioning  Measure  to  Support  Strengthening  the  Foundations  for  Economic 
Growth  as  well  as the  Fund-Provisioning  Measure to  Stimulate  Bank  Lending,  and  these 
also continue to this day. As illustrated, the Bank has pursued monetary easing by making 
full  use  of  various  means.  As  a  result,  accommodative  financial  conditions  have  been 
realized  in Japan,  as  seen  in,  for  example,  the  fact  that long-term interest  rates  since  the 
2000s had generally been at a low level of around 1-2 percent and that the rates during the 
one year before Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) began in 2013 were 
around 0.8 percent on average. Such accommodative financial conditions have underpinned 
the economy, and the Bank's large-scale fund-provisioning measures have contributed -- in 
certain phases -- to maintaining financial system stability and preventing the economy from 
falling  into  a  deflationary  spiral.  Nevertheless,  it  is  true  that  at  the  same  time  there 
continued to be mild deflation. Therefore, the Bank made a strong and clear commitment to 
ensuring the economy's exit from deflation -- which had lasted for nearly 15 years -- and 
began large-scale monetary easing to fulfill the commitment. This is QQE, which continues 
through to the present. 
7 
B. Introduction of the Price Stability Target of 2 Percent and QQE 
The  Bank  introduced  the  price  stability  target  in  January  2013  and  set  it  at  2  percent  in 
terms  of  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI.  Until  then,  it  had  judged  the  "price 
stability goal in the medium to long term" to be in a positive range of 2 percent or lower in 
terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI, and had set a goal of 1 percent for the 
time being. At the same time, the government and the Bank released a joint statement, in 
which  they  emphasized  their  policy  coordination.  I  view  this  as  extremely  important, 
because it indicated the determination by the government and the Bank to work together in 
order  to  overcome  deflation  and  achieve  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  Bank  then 
introduced QQE in April 2013. After increasing the amount of its asset purchases further in 
2014, it adopted a negative interest rate policy in January 2016 and introduced QQE with 
Yield Curve Control in September of that year. 
 
1. Basic mechanism of monetary easing 
Since the introduction of QQE in April 2013, the basic mechanism of monetary easing itself 
has  not  changed;  that  is,  (1)  pushing  down  the  entire  yield  curve  through  the  Bank's 
large-scale  purchases  of  Japanese  government  bonds  (JGBs),  and  (2)  raising  inflation 
expectations through the Bank's strong commitment to the 2 percent price stability target. 
The  transmission  mechanism  envisaged  by  the  Bank  is  that  these  factors  will  lead  to  a 
reduction  in  real  interest  rates,  thereby  producing  positive  effects  on  Japan's  economic 
activity and prices (Chart 5).   
 
2. Positive effects of QQE 
In 2016, the Bank conducted a comprehensive assessment of the developments in Japan's 
economic activity and prices as well as policy effects since the introduction of QQE. The 
findings of the assessment are that the mechanism just described has been operating firmly, 
such  that  even  long-term  real  interest  rates  have  been  in  negative  territory,  and  that 
economic activity and prices have largely improved. The underlying trend in the CPI (all 
items less fresh food and energy) turned positive and has been in such territory for more 
than two and a half years; this also leads to the judgment that, through the achievement of 
highly accommodative financial conditions, Japan's economy has reached a state of being 
8 
no longer in deflation, which is commonly defined as a sustained decline in prices (Chart 6). 
It is reasonable to regard this as achievements accomplished under QQE. 
 
3. Aims of QQE with Yield Curve Control 
Despite  the  fact  that  QQE  has  proven  to  be  effective  in  this  manner,  why  did  the  Bank 
introduce  last  year  QQE  with  Yield  Curve  Control  as  a  means  of  strengthening  the 
framework for monetary easing? 
 
My  understanding  is  that  there  are  two  points  as  the  background  to  this.  First,  although 
QQE has produced its intended effects, the price stability target of 2 percent has not been 
achieved, and therefore a more effective framework was necessary. 
 
Second, while it was confirmed that the combination of large-scale purchases of JGBs and 
the negative interest rate policy was effective in influencing the entire yield curve, there was 
concern over a possibility that this combination could in some cases push down the yield 
curve more than necessary, thereby having a negative impact on financial functioning. 
 
Let me briefly elaborate on this second point. In Japan, because the level of interest rates -- 
including  long-term  ones  --  has  remained  low,  as  I  mentioned  earlier,  and  lending 
competition  has  been  severe  amid  a  decreasing  trend  in  loan-to-deposit  ratios,  financial 
institutions' loan-deposit interest margins have been on a declining trend since the 1990s. In 
that sense, this has been a challenge faced by financial institutions' management even before 
the introduction of the negative interest rate policy. Since the introduction, it is true that the 
decline in deposit rates has been smaller than the decline in lending rates. Therefore, the 
excessive  declines  in  long-term  and  super-long-term  rates  should  have  spurred  on  the 
declining trend in interest margins. It was confirmed that, if the situation were to continue, 
financial  institutions'  profits  could  be  affected  to  some  extent.  The  excessive  declines  in 
long-term  and  super-long-term  rates  lower  the  rate  of  return  on  insurance  and  pension 
products; therefore, it is possible that such developments can cause uncertainty regarding 
the sustainability of financial functioning in a broad sense, thereby having a negative impact 
on economic activity through a deterioration in people's sentiment. Given such issues to be 
considered,  the  Bank  decided  that  it  was  appropriate  to  shift  to  a  policy  framework  that 
9 
would enable it to conduct monetary policy in a flexible manner. 
 
4. Yield curve control 
Under "yield curve control," which is the major component of the new framework, the Bank 
is able to conduct monetary policy in an effective and flexible manner by taking account of 
the economic, price, and financial conditions, as it directly targets long-term interest rates. 
To  put  it  simply,  nothing  has  changed  in  terms  of  the  Bank's  commitment,  in  that  it  is 
continuing with large-scale JGB purchases; however, while the Bank used to set the paces 
of  increase  in  the  monetary  base  and  the  amount  outstanding  of  its  JGB  holdings  as  its 
operating targets, in the new framework it has set the short-term policy interest rate and the 
target level of the 10-year JGB yields as its operating targets. Under the past framework, it 
was clear how JGB purchases are conducted, but there was a possibility that the purchases 
could  push  down  yields  either  insufficiently  or  excessively,  in  comparison  with  an 
appropriate yield curve. I would note that the new framework enables the Bank to conduct 
monetary policy while also paying due attention to the impact on the financial functioning. 
 
5. Inflation-overshooting commitment 
Another  component  of  QQE  with  Yield  Curve  Control  is  an  "inflation-overshooting 
commitment."  With  this  commitment,  the  Bank  aims  to  raise  inflation  expectations  by 
demonstrating its strong determination.   
 
Inflation expectations are formed through the following two mechanisms: (1) an adaptive 
formation  mechanism,  in  which  the  formation  is  influenced  by  the  course  of  the  past 
inflation rate, and (2) a forward-looking formation mechanism, in which the formation is 
based on the idea that the observed inflation rate will, in due course, meet the price stability 
target  set  by  the  central  bank.  On  this  point,  the  mechanism  of  formation  of  inflation 
expectations in Japan tends to be adaptive, and considerably more so than in other countries 
(Chart  7).  The  Bank  has  attempted  to  make  expectation  formation  more  forward-looking 
through QQE. In reality, however, before the forward-looking expectation formation fully 
took hold, the observed inflation rate declined, due mainly to the fall in crude oil prices. As 
a  result,  people's  inflation  expectations  also  declined  in an adaptive  manner.  Therefore,  I 
consider  that,  in  order  to  achieve  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent,  it  is  absolutely 
10 
necessary  to  raise  inflation  expectations  and  promote  a  shift  in  expectation  formation 
toward  a  more  forward-looking  direction.  The  inflation-overshooting  commitment  is  a 
means to this end. 
 
Although  the  momentum  toward  achieving  the  2  percent  price  stability  target  has  been 
maintained,  it  continues  to  lack  firmness.  The  Bank  will  make  policy  adjustments  as 
appropriate,  taking  account  of  developments  in  economic  activity  and  prices  as  well  as 
financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price 
stability target. 
 
III. Reinforcement of the Virtuous Cycle 
As  I  mentioned  earlier,  the  challenge  facing  Japan's  economy  is  to  further  reinforce  the 
virtuous cycle from income to spending in both the household and corporate sectors. 
 
Let  me  reiterate  that  consumption  has  not  increased  as  much  in  the  household  sector, 
considering the tight labor market conditions and the increase in employee income. Several 
factors have been pointed out as the cause of such sluggishness in private consumption; for 
example, (1) temporary factors such as the effects of a decline in stock prices and the effects 
of irregular weather, and (2) pressure from stock adjustments of durable goods. In addition, 
my impression is that a vague uneasiness among people about the future cannot be ignored. 
This uneasiness has a great impact on private consumption in Japan, where the population is 
aging rapidly and consumption by elderly households whose heads are aged 60 years and 
older is estimated to account for about half of total consumption.   
 
Turning  to  a  related  but  different  subject  now,  I  would  like  to  introduce  a  survey  result, 
which  reveals  that  concerns  among  the  elderly  about  their  living  during  retirement  are 
noticeable in Japan compared to some other countries. According to a survey on the daily 
lives and attitudes of the elderly conducted by the Cabinet Office in 2015, nearly 60 percent 
of the elderly in Japan consider that they do not have enough savings and assets to provide 
for  retirement.  This  percentage  is  the  highest  among  countries  surveyed  (Chart  8). 
Meanwhile, the percentage of the elderly in Japan who responded that they had made no 
special effort to prepare for retirement until they reached 60 years old was more than 40 
11 
percent, which is also remarkably high compared to other countries (Chart 9). I think what 
is necessary to relieve such anxiety is to enhance the sustainability of a wide range of social 
security systems, including pension and medical systems, as well as change the attitudes of 
the people and step up their financial literacy. 
 
Meanwhile, I believe that an increase in growth expectations is what it takes to drive the 
virtuous  cycle  from  income  to  spending  in  the  corporate  sector.  In  this  context,  the 
government decided the Japan Revitalization Strategy 2016 in June 2016 and launched the 
10  strategic  public-private  joint  projects,  in  which  the  public  and  private  sectors  share 
knowledge and strategy, and cultivate new promising markets (Chart 10). Looking at the list 
of projects may leave an impression that it is an all-around list of challenges facing Japan's 
economy.  I  believe  that what  the economy  needs now  is  to  implement  various  initiatives 
simultaneously  to  overcome  many  such  challenges.  These  challenges  are  closely 
interrelated, and working on one often plays an essential part in dealing with another. For 
instance, efforts toward realizing the fourth industrial revolution, which is the first of the 
key  policy  measures,  are  likely  be  centered  on  bringing  about  innovations  by  using 
technological  breakthroughs  from  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  big  data,  and  artificial 
intelligence. Needless to say, this is also an essential element for improving productivity in 
the  service  industry  and  bringing  about  an  industrial  revolution  among  small  and 
medium-sized  firms,  as  well  as  micro  firms.  Furthermore,  the  working-style  reform, 
promoted under the Japan Revitalization Strategy, will help facilitate smooth movements of 
human  resources  into  growth  areas.  In  addition,  this  reform  is  also  important  from  the 
viewpoint  of  stimulating  domestic  demand  for  tourism  by  facilitating  the  taking  of  long 
enough holidays. What I mean is that, while these initiatives may look like "a little bit of 
everything,"  firmly  promoting  them  in  order  to  achieve  economic  revitalization  in  an 
omnidirectional manner, and thereby revitalizing Japan's economy, is necessary. I think that 
this  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  growth  expectations,  and  ultimately  to  a  rise  in  inflation 
expectations. 
 
For  Japan's  economy,  the  third  largest  in  the  world,  ending  deflation  and  returning  to  a 
sustainable  growth  path  will  also  have  significant  meaning  for  the  global  economy.  The 
Bank will maintain highly accommodative financial conditions, with a view to achieving 
12 
the price stability target of 2 percent, and ensure the overcoming of deflation. I believe that 
highly accommodative financial conditions, combined with the initiatives of the public and 
private  sectors  just  mentioned,  will  give  a  boost  to  firms'  investment  and  efforts  for 
improving  productivity.  Let  me  conclude  by  emphasizing  that  ensuring  the  exit  from 
deflation in Japan will lead to a more dynamic and stronger economy. 
 
Thank you for your attention.

only just enough." Elderly who considered neither that they "do not have enough" nor that they "have enough" responded either "no need to 
have assets, as social security should cover expenses for basic daily life" or "don't know."
