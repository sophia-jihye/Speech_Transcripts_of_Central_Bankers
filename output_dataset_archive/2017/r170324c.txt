 "Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing 
with Yield Curve Control": 
After Half a Year since Its Introduction 
Speech at a Reuters Newsmaker Event in Tokyo 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
Introduction 
I would like to express my sincerest gratitude for the opportunity today to explain the Bank's 
monetary policy. 
Half  a  year  has  passed  since  the  Bank  introduced  "Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Monetary 
Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control" in September 2016. This new framework has been 
working  smoothly.  Today,  looking  back  at  developments  in  the  global  economy  and  the 
global financial markets since 2015, I would like to explain the background to and thinking 
behind the adoption of the new policy framework, following the introduction of a negative 
interest rate. Then, I would like to talk about the current situation of and outlook for Japan's 
economy, as well as the Bank's stance on monetary policy going forward. 
I. The Background to the Adoption of "QQE with Yield Curve Control" and Thinking 
behind It 
A. Turbulence in Global Financial Markets and the Introduction of a Negative Interest Rate 
Turbulence in Global Financial Markets 
Let  me  look  back  at  developments  in  the  global  financial  markets  since  summer  2015. 
Investors'  risk  sentiment  started  to  worsen  against  the  background  of  the  slowdown  in 
emerging  economies,  including  China,  and  uncertainties  regarding  those  economies.  In 
particular, after the turn of 2016, the global financial markets rapidly became destabilized due 
to  heightened  concerns  regarding  emerging  economies,  which  were  triggered  by  the 
significant decline in the Shanghai stock prices (Chart 1). The decline in commodity prices, 
including crude oil prices, exacerbated the situation. Under such circumstances, pessimistic 
views about the outlook for the global economy prevailed, such as the "secular stagnation" 
hypothesis.  Major  economies  faced  the  common  policy  challenges  of  how  to  address  low 
growth, as well as low inflation under low interest rates, and this topic was hotly debated at 
international fora such as the Group of Twenty (G-20) Finance Ministers and Central Bank 
Governors Meeting. 
Naturally,  such  headwinds  for  the  global  economy  had  a  significant  negative  impact  on 
Japan's economy as well. In financial markets, the yen appreciated and stock prices declined. 
On  the  inflation  front,  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  consumer  price  index  (CPI) 
1 
excluding fresh food turned negative in 2016 for the first time in three years, due to the effects 
of the decline in crude oil prices since summer 2014. Inflation expectations -- which play a 
key  role  in  achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent  --  weakened,  reflecting  the 
headwinds for the global economy that I mentioned earlier, after having remained more or 
less flat amid the significant decline in crude oil prices (Chart 2). 
The Introduction of a Negative Interest Rate and Its Effects 
It  was  against these  backgrounds  that  the  Bank  introduced "QQE  with a  Negative  Interest 
Rate"  in  January  2016  in  order  to  address  these  strong  headwinds  and  achieve  the  price 
stability target of 2 percent. 
To  reduce  real interest  rates  amid  weakening  inflation  expectations,  nominal interest  rates 
needed to be lowered further. The negative interest rate aimed at an additional reduction in 
the levels of short- and long-term interest rates by pushing down the short end of the yield 
curve, in combination with purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs). 
The introduction of a negative interest rate produced significant effects in terms of lowering 
nominal interest rates. Specifically, JGB yields declined considerably across the entire yield 
curve  (Chart  3).  As  a  consequence,  lending  rates  as  well  as  issuance  rates  for  CP  and 
corporate bonds also declined clearly. The lending attitude of financial institutions became 
more positive. There was no doubt that the negative interest rate made financial conditions 
more accommodative, supporting firms' and households' economic activities in Japan against 
the headwinds for the global economy. 
At the same time, however, it became necessary to take account of the impact of the negative 
interest rate on the functioning of financial intermediation in a broad sense as the yield curve 
had  headed  toward  flattening  by  more  than  expected.  Specifically,  Banks'  basic  business 
model consists of raising short-term funds and investing in long-term assets, and there was 
little room for declines in interest rates on deposits, which are the main funding tools. This 
means that the flattening of the yield curve at a low level reduces the spread between deposit 
and lending rates, thereby squeezing banks' profits. If profits were squeezed for a long period 
of time, this would affect their financial soundness cumulatively and exert adverse effects on 
2 
the functioning of financial intermediation. In addition, an excessive decline in the levels of 
interest rates such as those with long and super-long maturities lowers the rate of return on 
insurance and pension products and might have a negative impact on economic activity by 
leading to a deterioration in people's sentiment. 
B. Thinking behind "QQE with Yield Curve Control" 
Based  on  such  recognition,  the  Bank  conducted  in  September  2016  a  comprehensive 
assessment of developments in economic activity and prices as well as policy effects since the 
introduction  of  QQE.  In  light  of  the  findings  of  the  assessment,  it  introduced  "QQE  with 
Yield  Curve  Control"  as  a  means  of  enhancing  and  strengthening  the  previous  policy 
frameworks. The new framework consists of two components (Chart 4). 
The first is an inflation-overshooting commitment. Specifically, this is a commitment that the 
Bank will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the 
observed CPI exceeds 2 percent and stays above that level in a stable manner. The key point 
is that the commitment is based on the observed CPI, and not the outlook. The price stability 
target needs to be achieved on average over the business cycle. Thus, it naturally is assumed 
that  there  would  be  phases  when  the  observed  CPI  exceeds  2  percent.  Considering  that  it 
takes some time for monetary policy to have an impact on economic activity and prices, it is 
exceptional  for  a  central  bank  to  make  such  a  strong  commitment  that  is  based  on  the 
observed CPI. Since the global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve in the United States and 
some other central banks introduced "forward guidance," in which a central bank provides 
information about the future course of monetary policy. It is common for a central bank to 
design the forward guidance based on its forecast. However, in Japan, where  the observed 
CPI has been below 2 percent for a long period, in order to raise inflation expectations to 
around 2 percent and anchor them firmly at that level, it is essential that the public actually 
experiences inflation at or above 2 percent for some time and thereby the perception takes 
hold  among  them  that  prices  of  goods  and  services  tend  to  go  up  every  year  by  around  2 
percent. With this in mind, the Bank committed itself to continue with large-scale monetary 
expansion  until  such  situation  is  achieved  through  this  unique  inflation-overshooting 
commitment. 
3 
The  second  component  of  the  new  policy  framework  is  yield  curve  control.  Under  this 
framework, the Bank sets the levels of short- and long-term interest rates as the operating 
targets  in  the  guideline  for  market  operations,  instead  of  the  amount  of  increase  in  the 
monetary base and the amount of JGB purchases in the previous frameworks. It will facilitate 
the  formation  of  a  yield  curve  that  is  considered  most  appropriate  for  maintaining  the 
momentum  toward  achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent,  taking  account  of 
developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. In the current 
guideline for market operations, the Bank sets the short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 
percent and the target level of the 10-year JGB yields at around 0 percent. 
 Yield  curve  control  is  designed  to  enable  the  Bank  to  conduct  monetary  policy  in  a  more 
flexible manner, depending on the situation, compared to the previous frameworks in which 
the amount  of  JGB  purchases  was  fixed.  For  example,  the impact  of  a  unit amount  of  the 
Bank's JGB purchases on long-term yields varies depending on the economic and inflation 
conditions as well as  the state of the JGB market.  In the previous  frameworks that set the 
amount of JGB purchases as the operating target, the yield curve could deviate either upward 
or downward from the one that the Bank deemed appropriate. In contrast, yield curve control 
-- by setting the specific target level of the 10-year JGB yields -- enables the Bank to conduct 
JGB purchases in a flexible and effective manner to achieve  the target, making the policy 
framework more sustainable. 
 It often is argued that the Bank's JGB purchases are approaching the limit. My response to 
this  argument  is  as  follows.  First  of  all,  the  Bank  has  been  conducting  JGB  purchases 
smoothly so far, and I do not think it will face difficulties in the near future. Even if JGBs to 
be purchased by the Bank become scarce at some point in the future as the supply-demand 
conditions in the JGB market tighten, the impact of a  unit amount of its JGB purchases on 
long-term yields accordingly should become more significant, with all else being equal. Put 
differently,  the  Bank  can  have  the  same  degree  of  effect  in  lowering  interest  rates  with  a 
smaller amount of JGB purchases. In financial markets, some argue that the Bank will have 
difficulties with JGB purchases in the future and lose its control over long-term interest rates 
eventually.  That  will  not  happen.  In  fact,  yield  curve  control  is  designed  to  be  highly 
sustainable.

II.  Improvement  in  the  Global  Economy  and  Current  Situation  of  and  Outlook  for 
Japan's Economy 
A. Current Business Conditions and Outlook 
Next, I would like to talk about developments in the global economy since the second half of 
last year, as well as the current situation of and outlook for Japan's economy and prices amid 
these global economic developments. 
 Up  until  around  last  autumn,  financial  markets  were  dominated  by  pessimistic  views 
regarding the outlook for the global economy. With the benefit of hindsight, it appears that the 
global economy hit bottom in the first half of last year. Since the middle of last year, various 
economic  indicators  have  improved,  and  a  salient  feature  is  that  improvement  in 
manufacturing  activities  and  international  trade  has  become  clear  in  both  advanced  and 
emerging economies (Chart 5). The global economy since the outbreak of the global financial 
crisis has been characterized by what has been labeled "slow trade,"  a phenomenon of the 
trade volume having remained sluggish relative to the economic growth rate, but this trend 
now  appears  to  be  changing.  In  addition,  following  the  presidential  election  in  the  United 
States, business sentiment -- especially among U.S. firms -- has greatly increased, reflecting 
expectations that the growth rate will accelerate on the basis of proactive economic policies 
by  the  new  administration.  As  a  result,  the  growth  momentum  of  the  global  economy  is 
steadily gathering pace (Chart 6). 
 Amid  these  favorable  developments  in  the  global  economy,  improvements  have  been 
observed  in  Japan's  economy  as  well.  One  is  that  a  pick-up  in  exports  and  production  is 
becoming evident. Against the backdrop of strong global IT-related demand and progress in 
inventory and capital stock adjustments in emerging economies, the range of items in which 
exports are increasing has steadily widened and the growth in exports is gradually becoming 
more sustained. Production is picking up as well, reflecting moderate increases in domestic 
and  overseas  demand  as  well  as  progress  in  inventory  adjustments.  Under  these 
circumstances,  corporate  profits  are  improving  and  business  fixed  investment  is  on  a 
moderate increasing trend. 
  5 
Another  is  that  private  consumption  is  picking  up.  Despite  steady  improvements  in  the 
employment  and  income  situation,  such  as  the  drop  in  the  unemployment  rate  to  about  3 
percent  and  moderate  wage  growth,  private  consumption  showed  relatively  weak 
developments  in  the  first  half  of  last  year.  This  was  likely  due  mainly  to  the  impact  on 
consumer sentiment of the negative wealth effects resulting from the decline in stock prices. 
In recent months, consumer sentiment has been improving steadily, partly due to the recovery 
in  stock  prices,  and  the  Consumption  Activity  Index  (CAI),  which  the  Bank  compiles  by 
combining various sales and supply-side statistics, has picked up since last summer (Chart 7). 
 Japan's  economy  is  more firmly  making  steps toward  a  recovery.  Going  forward,  with  the 
virtuous  cycle  from  income  to  spending  being  maintained  in  both  the  corporate  and 
household sectors, the economy is likely to continue growing at a pace above its potential. 
 B. The Current Situation of and Outlook for Prices 
Next, I would like to turn to inflation. As mentioned earlier, partly as a result of the decline in 
crude oil prices, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh food had been in 
negative territory during 2016, and most recently it is 0.1 percent. However, looking at the 
year-on-year rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh food and energy, while this was around 
minus 0.5 percent before the introduction of QQE, it turned positive in autumn 2013 and has 
remained so for more than three years since then. This is the first time this has occurred since 
Japan's economy fell into deflation in the late 1990s. Japan is no longer in deflation, which is 
commonly defined as a sustained decline in general prices (Chart 8).  
 That being said, even in terms of the CPI excluding fresh food and energy, the rate of increase 
in prices has been slowing since the beginning of last year, and  stagnant in recent months. 
This is perhaps because firms have refrained from revising prices upward in response to the 
lackluster private consumption mentioned earlier, and because the yen's appreciation during 
last year affected the prices of consumer durable goods and other items.  
 As a result, recent price developments have been somewhat sluggish, but we believe that the 
momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent has been maintained and 
the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh food is likely to increase toward 2 
 6 
percent.  Let  me  mention  three  channels  for  higher  inflation  going  forward.  First, 
improvement in the output gap, as seen in the tightening of labor market conditions, will lead 
to an increase in the inflation rate mainly through wage increases. Second, energy prices will 
start  to  push  up  the  CPI,  while  the  downward  pressure  of  the  past  yen  appreciation  will 
gradually abate. Third, these developments, with the Bank's strong commitment to achieving 
the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent,  will  lead  to  higher  medium-  to  long-term  inflation 
expectations among the public. 
 Let  me  elaborate  on  these  factors.  The  tightening  of  labor  market  conditions  is  exerting 
upward pressure on wages. As I have mentioned repeatedly, the Bank aims at a moderate rise 
in the CPI inflation accompanied by a rise in corporate profits and wages. Recently, private 
consumption  is  picking  up  amid  the  steady  improvement  in  the  employment  and  income 
situation. If this situation continues, firms  are expected to be  more proactive in their  price 
setting again. 
 Meanwhile, the contribution of energy prices to the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI, 
which was more than minus 1 percentage point, has been shrinking gradually and is currently 
more or less neutral. Going forward, assuming that crude oil prices will remain roughly flat, 
as indicated by prices in futures markets, the contribution will turn slightly positive in fiscal 
2017. It should be noted, however, that this will be temporary and fall off again in fiscal 2018. 
The  Bank  does  not  intend  to  achieve  the  2  percent  target  by  simply  depending  on  rising 
energy prices. In order to achieve the 2 percent price stability target in a sustainable manner, it 
is necessary for actual increases in prices to lead to higher medium- to long-term inflation 
expectations  through  the  adaptive  formation  mechanism,  resulting  in  an  increase  in  the 
underlying trend of the inflation rate.  
 III. The Bank's Stance on Monetary Policy Going Forward 
Lastly, I would like to explain the Bank's stance on monetary policy going forward. 
 As I explained earlier, yield curve control can facilitate the formation of the yield curve that is 
deemed most appropriate for maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability 
target of 2 percent, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as 
 7 
financial  conditions.  The  Bank  will  continue  to  conduct  monetary  policy  based  on  this 
principle. 
 Let me elaborate on this point. In assessing developments in economic activity and prices, the 
Bank takes into account both its outlook for those developments and risk factors as presented 
in  the  Outlook  for  Economic  Activity  and  Prices  (Outlook  Report).  Regarding  financial 
conditions, it takes into consideration the effects of the prevailing interest rate environment 
on the functioning of financial intermediation. 
 Based on this framework, the current situation can be explained as follows. With regard to 
economic and price developments, there is still a long way to go to achieve the price stability 
target of 2 percent, although an improvement has been observed. As described in the January 
2017 Outlook Report, the momentum toward achieving the 2 percent target is maintained but 
not yet sufficiently firm. As for risk factors, risks to both economic activity and prices are 
skewed to the downside, and developments in medium- to long-term inflation expectations 
warrant  particular  attention.  According  to  the  Policy  Board  members'  forecasts  for  prices 
presented in the Outlook Report, which are higher than those of private-sector economists, 
the  timing  of  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI  reaching  2  percent  will  likely  be 
around fiscal 2018. Taking all of these elements into account, there is no reason to reduce the 
level  of  monetary  accommodation  at  the  moment  in  terms  of  economic  and  price 
developments. In this regard, let me add that the Bank's monetary policy should be designed 
to  achieve  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent,  responding  to  the  situation  in  Japan's 
economy. The Bank will not raise the target level of the long-term interest rates just because 
of a rise in such rates in other countries. 
 Next, let me make an assessment of the current situation in terms of financial conditions, or 
the effects on the functioning of financial intermediation. There is no need for now to raise 
interest rates, either in terms of the short-term policy interest rate or the target level of the 
long-term interest rates. The investment environment for insurance and pension products has 
become more favorable as super-long-term interest rates have increased compared to those in 
September 2016 (Chart 9). Banks have maintained their positive lending attitude,  although 
yields in the short- to medium-term zone -- which affect banks' profits to a large extent -- have 
 8 
remained negative and the spread between deposit and lending rates has been on a declining 
trend (Chart 10). The amount outstanding of bank lending has been increasing at an annual 
rate of around 2.5 percent to 3.0 percent. These developments show that the functioning of 
financial  intermediation  for  supporting  economic  activity  has  not  been  impaired. 
Nevertheless, the effects of low interest rates on the functioning of financial intermediation 
would  be  cumulative  with  the  passage  of  time.  The  Bank  will  continue  to  examine  such 
effects while keeping in close communication with financial institutions. 
 Let  me  summarize  our  assessment.  From  any  of  three aspects  --  the economy,  prices,  and 
financial conditions -- it is obvious that the Bank should maintain the current yield curve and 
thereby make the most of the improvement in the global economy, with a view to achieving 
the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time. 
 I would like to add one thing on this point. The guideline for market operations is decided at 
each  Monetary  Policy  Meeting  in  line  with  the  thinking  that  I  have  just  explained.  The 
conduct  of  market  operations  including  JGB  purchases  is  determined  practically  to 
implement the guideline in a smooth manner. As a result, such factors as the amount of JGB 
purchases  at  each  individual  auction  may  vary  depending  on  financial  market  conditions. 
However, this has no implications for monetary policy going forward. 
 Conclusion 
Since  the  introduction  of  QQE  in  April  2013,  the  Bank  has  reviewed  the  framework  of 
monetary easing several times, in response to changes in the environment. However, there 
has been absolutely no change in its commitment to achieving the price stability target of 2 
percent  at  the  earliest  possible  time.  I  believe  that  "QQE  with  Yield  Curve  Control," 
consisting of an "inflation-overshooting commitment" and "yield curve control," is the best 
possible framework that we can devise at present, given the situation in Japan -- the formation 
mechanism  of  inflation  expectations,  transmission  channels  of  monetary  easing,  and  the 
conditions in the financial system. Under this framework, the Bank will realize the maximum 
effects of monetary easing. 
 Thank you very much for your attention.
