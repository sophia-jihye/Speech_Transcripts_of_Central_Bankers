Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy 
Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Kyoto 
Masayoshi Amamiya 
Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
  Introduction 
Before I begin my speech, I would like to extend my sincere condolences to the victims of 
the torrential rains last month and express my deepest sympathies to those who are suffering. 
Some  areas,  especially  in  the  northern  part  of  Kyoto  Prefecture,  continue  to  be  severely 
affected and there is still much to be worried about.   
 I am very honored to have the opportunity to exchange views with administrative, financial, 
and business leaders in Kyoto Prefecture today. I would also like to take this opportunity to 
express my sincere gratitude for your cooperation with the activities of the Bank of Japan's 
Kyoto Branch. 
 At  the  Monetary  Policy  Meeting  (MPM)  two  days  ago,  the  Bank  released  its  quarterly 
Outlook for  Economic  Activity  and Prices  (Outlook  Report)  containing  the projections  for 
Japan's  economic  activity  and  prices  through  fiscal  2020  and  a  detailed  analysis  on  price 
developments. In addition, it strengthened the policy framework with a view to persistently 
continuing  with  the  current  powerful  monetary  easing.  Today,  I  would  like  to  explain  the 
Bank's  view  on  economic  activity  and  prices  as  well  as  the  new  policy  measures,  while 
outlining the Outlook Report. 
 I. Economic Developments in Japan 
Let  me  start  with  economic  developments  in  Japan.  Japan's  economy  has  improved 
significantly over the past five years. The current economic recovery phase, which began in 
December  2012,  has  reached  66  consecutive  months  this  May.  If  this  recovery  continues 
through January next year, it could overtake the longest post-war expansion of the economy 
so  far,  which lasted  73  months.  Corporate  profits  have  been  at  record  high  levels,  and the 
labor market has been close to full employment, with the unemployment rate  being in the 
range  of  2.0-2.5  percent  --  the  lowest  level  in  around  25  years  (Chart  1).  Confirming  this 
situation by looking at the output gap, which represents the utilization of capital and labor, 
shows  that  it  exceeded  the  long-term  average  of  0  percent  around  2013,  clearly  turned 
positive in the second half of 2016, and since then has been widening further within positive 
territory (Chart 2). Turning to wages and prices, a base pay increase has been achieved for 
five consecutive years as a result of wage negotiations. In addition, the year-on-year rate of 
 1 
change in the consumer price index (CPI) excluding energy and fresh food has been on an 
uptrend for more than four and a half years since autumn 2013, and Japan's economy is no 
longer in deflation, in the sense of a sustained decline in prices. 
 II. Price Developments 
Thus, Japan's economic activity and prices have improved steadily over the past five years. 
However,  prices  have  continued  to  show  relatively  weak  developments  compared  to  the 
economic expansion and the labor market tightening, and the Bank's price stability target of 
2 percent in terms of the annual inflation rate has not yet been achieved. For this reason, in 
formulating the latest Outlook Report, the Bank focused on examining the reasons for these 
sluggish price developments and their outlook. In what follows, I would like to present the 
contents of the report and talk in more detail about the price situation in Japan.   
 A. Why Is the Bank Aiming at 2 Percent Inflation? 
Before explaining the background to the continued relatively weak developments in prices, 
I  will  first  talk  about  the  reasons  why  the  Bank  is  aiming  at  achieving  the  price  stability 
target of 2 percent. I start with this topic because people often make comments such as "The 
price stability target of 2 percent is too high in the first place and it may not be necessary to 
aim at it forcibly," or "As long as the economy is growing, it would be better if prices do not 
rise." 
 The fundamental mission of central banks in conducting monetary policy is to achieve price 
stability. Price stability is a situation that is neither deflationary nor inflationary  -- in other 
words,  prices  neither  rise  nor  fall  --  and  thus  could  mean  that  the  year-on-year  rate  of 
change  is  0  percent  in  numerical  terms.  However,  the  specific  definition  of  price  stability 
currently shared among advanced economies is that a slightly positive annual inflation rate, 
rather than a rate of 0 percent, would be desirable (Chart 3).   
 The first reason is that the CPI -- the price statistics that many central banks refer to -- has a 
statistical  tendency  of  demonstrating  a  slightly  higher  inflation  rate  than  the  actual  one. 
While  I  will  not  explain  this  in  detail,  as  it  is  somewhat  technical,  considering  such 
statistical tendency, or upward bias, an appropriate figure for price stability in terms of the 
 2 
CPI is a slightly positive figure. 
 The second reason for aiming at 2 percent inflation is the need to have a buffer for monetary 
policy.  Central  banks  usually  respond  to  inflation  and  deflation  by  raising  or  lowering 
interest  rates.  In  the  event  of  inflation,  central  banks  can  raise  interest  rates  as  much  as 
necessary to suppress inflation. The reason for this is that there is no ceiling to interest rates. 
On  the  other  hand,  when  we  face  deflation,  there  is  a  limit  to  the  extent  to which  interest 
rates can be lowered. In recent years, a new approach employing negative interest rates has 
been developed, but it remains impossible to lower interest rates without limits. Deflation is 
a  more  troublesome  phenomenon  than  inflation  in  the  sense  that  central  banks'  ability  to 
respond to the former is limited. Thus, it is desirable to have a buffer for monetary policy; 
that  is,  to  secure  a  certain  "margin"  of  positive  inflation  and  positive  interest  rates  in 
advance,  so  that  central  banks  can  take  appropriate  responses  through  monetary  easing  if 
the economy heads toward deflation.   
 What  these  two  reasons  imply  is  that  we  should  aim  at  a  slightly  positive  inflation  rate. 
However, there is no simple answer as to whether this should be 1 percent, 2 percent, or 3 
percent. The important point is that central banks in major advanced economies more or less 
commonly  define  price  stability  as  2  percent.  Of  course,  this  is  not  based  on  a  reckless 
argument  that  we  should  simply  do  what  others  are  doing  because  there  is  no  conclusive 
evidence  as  to  what  the  inflation  target  should  be.  The  reason  why  major  advanced 
economies share the same inflation target and achieve a similar price situation is that, from 
a  long-term  perspective,  this  is  likely  to  result  in  stable  exchange  rates.  While  exchange 
rates fluctuate due to a variety of factors in the short term, their trend over a longer term of 
5 or 10 years reflects the difference in inflation between two countries. This is the concept 
of purchasing power parity. Therefore, aiming at the global standard of 2 percent inflation is 
very  important  in  achieving  stability  in  business  management  and  in  the  economy  as  a 
whole through stable exchange rates.   
 So far, I have provided three reasons why the Bank is aiming at the price stability target of 2 
percent.  However,  I  would  like  you  to  understand  that  the  Bank  does  not  think  that  it  is 
enough  simply  to  achieve  2  percent  inflation.  If  only  prices  rise,  real  wages  will  decrease 
 3 
and  economic  activity  will  stagnate.  As  clearly  stipulated  in  the  Bank  of  Japan  Act,  the 
Bank  shall  implement  monetary  policy  "aimed  at  achieving  price  stability,  thereby 
contributing to the sound development of the national economy." Thus, the Bank aims at an 
economy  in  which  prices  rise  moderately,  as  economic  activity  becomes  more  dynamic 
through  increases  in  firms'  sales  and  fixed  investment  as  well  as  improvement  in 
households' employment, wages, and consumption. An economy in which a virtuous cycle 
among  prices,  wages,  and  economic  activity  continues  to  operate  would  create  a  world  in 
which the price stability target of 2 percent is achieved. 
 B. Why Are Prices Sluggish? 
However, we are still halfway toward achieving the price  stability target of 2 percent. The 
latest  Outlook  Report  presents  a  fairly  detailed  analysis  on  reasons  why  prices  have 
remained sluggish even though the economy has improved significantly. Today I would like 
to present the essence of the report. 
 There  are  likely  to  be  two  main  factors  behind  the  fact  that  the  pace  of  improvement  in 
prices  has  remained  moderate.  One  is  that  the  mindset  and  behavior  based  on  the 
assumption  that  wages  and  prices  will  not  increase  easily  have  been  deeply  entrenched 
among firms and households due to the experience of prolonged low growth and deflation. 
The  other  is  that  the  large  room  to  raise  productivity  and  the  technological  progress  in 
recent years have allowed firms to constrain price rises as much as possible. Let me explain 
these factors in detail by households' and firms' behaviors. 
 First, it has been taking time for wage increases to fully take hold despite labor shortage. In 
particular,  scheduled cash  earnings  of  regular  employees,  who  account  for  the  majority  of 
total employees, have been sluggish. The year-on-year rate of increase in such earnings over 
the past year has remained at around 0.5 percent (Chart 4). It is said that regular employees, 
whose  wage  levels  are  relatively  high,  have  a  strong  tendency  to  place  priority  on  the 
stability  of  employment  over  wage  increases.  Such  tendency  still  seems  to  be  persistent, 
reflecting  the  experience  of  severe  employment  adjustments  under  prolonged  low  growth. 
In  addition,  wage  developments also  are  affected  by  growing  diversity  in  terms  of  worker 
type. From a long-term perspective, an increase in labor participation by women and seniors 
 4 
in recent years is essential to cope with the declining trend in the working-age population, 
which is a challenge for Japan's economy. In the short term, however, this increase will ease 
labor shortage, thereby constraining wage increases. 
 Second, the fact that households' tolerance of price rises has not been increasing clearly has 
been  constraining  a  rise  in  inflation.  According  to  the  Bank's  survey,  following  the 
introduction  of  quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary  easing  (QQE)  in  2013,  the  level  of 
households' tolerance of price rises shifted upward in a favorable direction compared to past 
levels. However, the level has not risen further (Chart 5). This is likely to be attributable to 
the  first  reason  mentioned  earlier  --  that  is,  it  has  been  taking  time  for  wage  increases  to 
fully take hold. 
 Third,  firms'  cautious  price-setting  stance  also  has  been  constraining  a  rise  in  inflation. 
Although wages have been rising, albeit moderately, and commodity prices such as of crude 
oil have been on an uptrend, firms that are concerned about possibly losing customers due 
to  price  hikes  have  been  making  efforts  to  absorb  upward  pressure  of  costs  on  prices  by 
increasing  labor-saving  investment  and  streamlining  their  business  process.  Firms  have 
been  enthusiastic  about  making  software  investment  in  sectors  such  as  "construction," 
"retailing,"  and  "accommodations,  eating  and  drinking  services,"  where  labor  shortage  is 
acute,  and  many  firms  have  offset  a  rise  in  labor  costs  by  introducing  self-checkout 
machines and automatic ordering system (Chart 6). These efforts by firms are likely made 
possible through the recent progress in information technology. 
 So  far,  I  have  talked  about  firms'  cautious  wage-  and  price-setting  stance  as  well  as 
households' cautiousness toward price rises. Such mindset and behavior can be regarded as 
a kind of "social mode" in Japan that has been brought about by the experience of prolonged 
low growth and deflation, and it is likely to have been taking time to resolve this. 
 In  addition,  the  effects  of  intensifying  competition  among  firms  cannot  be  ignored.  For 
example, retailers such as supermarkets have maintained their cautious price-setting stance, 
reflecting in part the expansion of online shopping (Chart 7). This is the so-called Amazon 
Effect, which is another example of rapid progress in information technology constraining a 
 5 
rise in inflation. 
 C. Why Will Inflation Rise Going Forward? 
Although  it  is  taking  time  for  inflation  to  rise,  some  changes  have  been  seen  amid  the 
continued  improvement  in  the  economic  and  employment  conditions  that  I  mentioned 
earlier.  For  example,  moves  to  raise  sales  prices  are  starting  to  be  observed  recently  at  a 
wide range of firms, mainly in the services sector, such as dining-out (Chart 8). In addition, 
according to the Bank's Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan), the 
number  of  enterprises  answering  that  the  output  prices  have  risen  has  been  exceeding  the 
number of those answering that such prices have fallen for the first time in a while. As the 
so-called baby boomers are reaching their 70s, labor market conditions are likely to tighten 
further  and  the  pace  of  increase  in  wages  of  mainly  part-time  employees  is  expected  to 
accelerate.  As  the  effects  of  such  moves  of  wage  increases  spread  to  regular  employees' 
wages,  this  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  households'  tolerance  of  price  rises.  When  this 
happens, price rises by firms will be more easily accepted. 
 While  price  developments  are  affected  by  various  factors  that  I  have  explained  so  far,  the 
factor  that  determines  the  underlying  trend  in  prices  is  the  aggregate  supply-demand 
balance. As the output gap has been maintained within positive territory -- showing excess 
demand -- for a long time, in reflection of economic expansion, many of the aforementioned 
factors  that  have  been  constraining  inflation  will  likely  be  resolved  gradually.  If  that 
happens,  another  important  factor  that  forms  the  underlying  trend  in  prices  is  likely  to 
change  --  that  is,  people's  perception  of  prices,  which  means  inflation  expectations  in  a 
broad  sense,  including  households'  tolerance  of  price  rises  and  firms'  price-setting 
strategies. 
 The  Bank  assesses  such  factors that determine  the underlying  trend  in  prices  by  using  the 
word "momentum." If you look up "momentum" in a dictionary, it is defined as "force" or 
"impetus,"  which  imply  a  short  period  of  time.  However,  as  the  objective  of  monetary 
policy  is  achieving  price  stability  in  the  long  term,  the  Bank  assesses  the "momentum"  in 
terms of a somewhat longer time frame. Specifically, it makes a comprehensive judgment as 
to whether the momentum is maintained by examining the main factors that determine the 
 6 
underlying  trend  in  prices,  such  as  the  output  gap  and  medium-  to  long-term  inflation 
expectations, while making use of various indicators and information. 
 In the latest Outlook Report, the Bank projects that the year-on-year rates of change in the 
CPI  (less  fresh  food)  for  fiscal  2018  through  fiscal  2020  are  likely  to  be  1.1  percent,  1.5 
percent,  and  1.6  percent, respectively  (Chart  9).  We  are  in  a  difficult  situation  in  terms  of 
achieving  2  percent  inflation  by  fiscal  2020,  as  it  is  taking  more  time  than  expected  for 
inflation  to  rise.  Nevertheless,  the  momentum  whereby  an  improvement  in  the  output  gap 
leads  to  an  increase  in  actual  inflation,  and  then  a  rise  in  inflation  expectations,  is 
maintained. It is of utmost importance to sustain such positive momentum by maintaining 
the output gap as long as possible within positive territory, and this is likely to be the most 
certain path toward achieving 2 percent inflation. 
 III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy 
Next, I would like to explain the Bank's conduct of monetary policy including the measures 
decided at the MPM held two days ago. 
 The  Bank  has  been  pursuing  powerful  monetary  easing  under  the  policy  framework  of 
"QQE  with Yield  Curve Control,"  aiming  to  achieve  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent 
(Chart  10).  In  order  to  achieve  the  price  stability  target  at  the  earliest  possible  time,  the 
Bank set the target level of 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields at around zero 
percent, and has purchased large amount of JGBs so that the yield curve would be formed in 
line  with the target.  By  conducting  this  operation, short-  and long-term  interest  rates  have 
been stable at low levels and lending rates as well as issuance rates for corporate bonds -- to 
which certain spreads are added in both cases -- also have remained at extremely low levels. 
The  amount  outstanding  of  bank  lending  has  been  increasing  firmly.  Thus,  the  current 
highly  accommodative  financial  conditions,  brought  about  by  yield  curve  control,  have 
largely contributed to an improvement in the output gap, stimulating firms' and households' 
spending activities. In addition, the Bank has purchased exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and 
Japan  real  estate  investment  trusts  (J-REITs)  with  a  view  to  exerting  positive  effects  on 
economic activity and prices through lowering risk premia in the stock market. 
  7 
As I explained, following the discussion at the latest MPM, the Bank released its economic 
projections,  which  show  that  it  will  take  more  time  than  expected  to  achieve  the  price 
stability  target  of  2  percent.  However,  the  momentum  toward  2  percent  inflation  has  been 
maintained.  Accordingly,  as  for  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy,  the  Bank  judged  it 
appropriate  to  persistently  continue  with  the  current  powerful  monetary  easing,  thereby 
maintaining the output gap as long as possible within positive territory, in order to make the 
momentum sustainable. 
 During  the  discussion,  we  thought  it  necessary  to  address  two  challenges.  The  first  is  to 
firmly maintain confidence among the public regarding the Bank's current policy stance that 
aims  at  achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent.  The  second  is  to  strengthen  the 
sustainability of the current powerful monetary easing so that the effects of monetary easing 
will  not  be  reduced  while  taking  care  of  such  factors  as  the  negative  effects  on  financial 
markets, in a situation where monetary easing needs to be continued. 
 In order to address these two challenges, the Bank decided to newly implement measures to 
strengthen  the  framework  of  powerful  monetary  easing.  Today,  within  the  limited  time 
provided, I would like to introduce particularly important measures (Chart 11). 
 First,  the  Bank  decided  to  strengthen  its  commitment  to  achieving  2  percent  inflation  by 
introducing forward guidance for policy rates. You may not be familiar with the  term, but 
forward  guidance  is  a  measure  that  guides  the  future  policy  path  in  order  to  strengthen 
market confidence and expectations toward monetary policy. At the latest MPM, the Bank 
publicly  committed  to  "maintain  the  current  extremely  low  levels  of  short-  and  long-term 
interest  rates  for  an  extended  period  of  time,  taking  into  account  uncertainties  regarding 
economic activity and prices including the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled to 
take place in October 2019." I would like to reiterate that, even though the projected timing 
of  reaching  2  percent  inflation  has  been  delayed,  the  Bank  will  not  reduce  the  degree  of 
monetary easing. 
 Second,  the  Bank  decided  to  implement  several  measures  to  enhance  the  sustainability  of 
"QQE with Yield Curve Control." For example, while the target level of 10-year JGB yields 
 8 
is around zero percent, as I mentioned earlier, the Bank made it clear that, under the target, 
the long-term yields might move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending 
on  developments  in  economic  activity  and  prices.  Recently,  there  is  a  growing  concern  in 
the  JGB  market  that  the  market  functioning  has  been  deteriorating,  with  the  long-term 
yields  being  somewhat  stuck  and  the  transaction  volume  being  on  a  declining  trend, 
although this can be regarded in a sense as the consequence of powerful monetary easing. In 
continuing with monetary easing, the Bank judged it necessary to allow the long-term yields 
to  move  upward  and  downward  to  some  extent  mainly  depending  on  developments  in 
economic activity and prices, thereby maintaining the market functioning so as not to create 
more  concern.  However,  the  target  level  of  the  long-term  yields  remains  at  around  zero 
percent. In case of a rapid increase in the yields, the Bank will purchase JGBs promptly and 
appropriately. The Bank does not expect the level of yields ratcheting up. In addition, as for 
ETF  purchases,  from  the  same  aspect  of  enhancing  the  sustainability  of  the  current 
monetary  policy  framework,  the  Bank  made  it  clear  that  it  might  increase  or  decrease  the 
amount of purchases depending on market conditions, while maintaining the annual pace of 
increase at about 6 trillion yen. 
 The aim of these policy measures is to strengthen the sustainability of the current powerful 
monetary easing, taking into account the side effects. The Bank recognizes that the effects 
of monetary easing will be strengthened as a whole, in consideration of this sustainability. 
 The  Bank  also  recognizes  the  risk  that,  by  continuing  such  powerful  monetary  easing, 
financial  institutions'  strength  will  be  cumulatively  affected  by  low  profitability,  mainly 
through  a  decrease  in  their  lending  margins,  and  thus  the  functioning  of  financial 
intermediation  will  be  stagnant.  Currently,  as  financial  institutions  have  sufficient  capital 
bases and their lending attitudes continue to be active, there is no serious problem with the 
functioning of financial intermediation. However, there is no change in the Bank's intention 
that  it  will  thoroughly  examine  the  risks  considered  most  relevant  to  the  conduct  of 
monetary policy. As a central bank, the Bank will continue  conducting monetary policy in 
an appropriate manner, taking account of developments in economic activity  and prices as 
well  as  financial  conditions,  so  that  the  momentum  toward  2  percent  inflation  will  be 
maintained  and  the  economy  thereby  will  grow  in  a  balanced  manner  between  economic 
 9 
expansion and price stability. 
 Conclusion 
To conclude, I would like to talk about the economy of Kyoto Prefecture. 
 Kyoto  Prefecture's  economy  can  be  judged  as  having  been  expanding,  even  though  the 
effects of the torrential rains a while ago can be seen in part. In Kyoto, there are a number 
of  global  manufacturers  that  represent  Japan  in  sectors  of  electronic  parts  and  devices  as 
well as industrial machinery. Moreover, Kyoto attracts attention from all over the world as 
an international tourist destination distinguished by more than 1,200 years of history. Thus, 
production and exports have been on an uptrend while steadily benefiting from the growth 
in overseas economies, and demand from foreign visitors also has been firm on the back of 
an increase in foreign tourists to Japan. In addition, business fixed investment has become 
more active, as seen in investment intended for capacity expansion as well as research and 
development in the manufacturing sector and that intended for extension of accommodation 
facilities  such  as  hotels  in  the  nonmanufacturing  sector.  Employee  income  also  has 
increased moderately. 
 Reflecting  such  favorable  economic  conditions,  labor  shortage  has  been  progressing  in 
Kyoto  Prefecture, as  is  the  case  nationwide.  In  this  situation,  active  labor  participation  by 
women  and  seniors  has  been  observed  and  labor-saving  investment  in  various  forms  is 
becoming  more  dynamic.  For  example,  a  wide  range  of  firms  irrespective  of  sector  have 
established  sections  specializing  in  promoting  diversity  and  worked  on  creating  various 
working  systems,  such  as  shorter  and  flexible  working  hours.  As  a  result,  some  have 
expressed the opinion that such moves have led to an increase in female and senior workers. 
In  addition,  many  firms  in  the  eating  and  drinking  services  as  well  as  accommodations 
sectors, which are underpinned by demand from foreign visitors, have been making up for 
labor  shortage  by  raising  productivity,  such  as  through  introducing  tablet  devices  and 
making  use  of  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT).  As  I  have  explained  today,  such  moves  may 
weaken upward pressure on wages and prices in the short term, but in the longer term, they 
will  raise  the  productivity  of  the  economy  as  a  whole,  thereby  strengthening  its  growth 
potential. As this potential rises, firms' spending behavior and households' consumption are 
 10 
likely  to  become  more  active,  eventually  contributing  to  pushing  up  prices.  Such  positive 
developments that have been clearly observed in the prefecture are expected to support the 
achievement of the 2 percent price stability target in a stable manner. 
 In  closing,  let  me  convey  my  best  regards  and  express  my  sincere  hope  that  you  will 
continue to make Kyoto even more attractive while uniting tradition and innovation for the 
further development of the prefecture's economy. 
 Thank you very much for your attention.

Since competitors have intensified their price-
cutting strategies, we may also cut sales prices 
further in the future
(a supermarket [Sendai]).
Consumers have a deep-rooted cost-saving 
mentality and we are losing customers to low-
price retail businesses such as drugstores and 
online retailers (a supermarket [Kyoto]). 
We are feeling the threat of other types of 
retail businesses that have intensified their 
price-cutting strategies at the expense of 
profits, and thus we have cut the sales prices 
of several hundred items, especially private-
brand products (a supermarket [Hiroshima]). 
Notes: 1. Figures are calculated using "total expenditure on goods and services ordered over the Internet" from the Survey of Household Economy and "consumption expenditures"
from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey.
2. In the right chart, the parentheses show the industry of the interviewee and the Bank branch.

Strengthening the Framework for Continuous Powerful Monetary Easing
Taking more time than expected to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent.
Maintaining the output gap as long as possible within positive territory is appropriate.
Persistently Continuing with Powerful Monetary Easing
Forward guidance for policy rates
"The Bank intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an 
extended period of time, taking into account uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including 
the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in October 2019."
⇒ Strengthening the commitment to achieving the price stability target
Enhancing the sustainability of  "Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with 
Yield Curve Control"
Long-term interest rate: The Bank maintains the target level of around zero percent. While doing so, 
the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on 
developments in economic activity and prices. 
Purchases of ETFs:        The Bank maintains the annual pace of increase in the amount outstanding of 
about 6 trillion yen. While doing so, the Bank may increase or decrease 
the amount of purchases depending on market conditions.                                  
Achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time while
securing stability in economic and financial conditions.
