     Ladies and Gentlemen, I wish you a warm welcome to the Swiss National Bank’s Money 
Market Event in Geneva.   
Ten years ago, back in the autumn of 2008, none of us knew when or how the crisis would 
end. At the time, central banks adopted a raft of measures to tackle multiple challenges in 
quick succession. Having exhausted the conventional monetary policy toolkit, they turned to 
more innovative approaches, cutting their short-term interest rates to unprecedented levels and 
substantially expanding their balance sheets.   
Today, a decade later, the worst fears have evaporated, economic growth has returned to a 
robust level in many parts of the world, and some central banks have started to gradually 
tighten their monetary policy. For the SNB, though, it is still too early to contemplate taking 
such action. At our last monetary policy assessment in September, we decided to maintain our 
expansionary monetary policy stance. Although economic developments are favourable, 
inflationary pressures remain low. Moreover, the Swiss franc remains highly valued and the 
situation on the foreign exchange market is still fragile.  
Against this backdrop, the contours of a ‘new normal’ are emerging for central banks. While 
there are still many significant unknowns in the political, geopolitical and economic arenas, 
one thing is certain: the environment in which the central banks operate has evolved 
considerably, mainly due to structural changes. Some of these changes had already begun well 
before the crisis, but they have accelerated in the intervening period. I am thinking here of the 
digitalisation of the economy, for example, as well as the emergence of new technologies on 
the financial markets.  
In this speech, I would like to outline how the SNB has had to adapt – and continues to adapt 
– to make sure it is always in a position to fulfil its mandate. To illustrate this point, I want to 
focus on three key markets for the SNB that have experienced major changes: the goods and 
services market, where digitalisation may be influencing pricing and where we, in turn, must 
remain alert if we are to fully grasp the associated dynamics; the foreign exchange market, 
where the emergence of new technologies and players has led us to expand our in-house 
capabilities and redouble our efforts to stay at the cutting edge of technological progress 
(Thomas Moser, Deputy Head of Department III since 1 September, will give you more detail 
on this topic); and finally, the money market, where structural changes are prompting us to 
work on modernising infrastructure and maintaining appropriate framework conditions in 
order to ensure effective implementation of monetary policy.  
Evolution of the goods and services market and weak inflation 
So let me start with the goods and services market and inflation developments. This market is 
presenting central banks with an important conundrum: why, given that the economy has 
firmed significantly since 2017, has inflation remained low in most advanced economies? 
  Page 2/9 
     Two major reasons stand out: on the one hand, monetary policy geared to price stability has 
firmly anchored inflation expectations; on the other, various structural factors linked to 
globalisation may have had a moderating effect on prices. 
As chart 1 shows, in Switzerland inflation remained low in the early post-crisis years, due in 
particular to the fall in energy prices and strong appreciation of the Swiss franc in the 
aftermath of the euro area debt crisis. Today, thanks in part to the monetary policy measures 
taken by the SNB to combat the strong appreciation of the Swiss franc, inflation for imported 
goods and services has returned to positive territory (cf. red bars). Furthermore, the price of 
oil is trending upwards. And finally, the consumer price index in Switzerland has been rising 
again since the beginning of 2017 and currently stands at 1.1% year-on-year. Nonetheless, 
inflation for domestic goods and services remains moderate despite robust economic 
momentum and a steadily improving labour market (cf. blue bars).  
Besides these factors, monetary policymakers may increasingly find themselves grappling 
with another issue: digitalisation and its impact on the level and dynamics of prices.1 
Digitalisation is affecting almost all sectors of the economy, but its effects are particularly 
pronounced in retail. In Switzerland, retail trade via online platforms has been experiencing 
double-digit growth for some years now, while traditional retail has been declining. Last year, 
online trade already accounted for some 8.5% of all Swiss retail trade.2  
Digitalisation can affect price developments in a variety of ways. On the one hand, the 
increased competition and greater transparency for consumers that online trade enables may 
erode the pricing power of traditional retailers. This phenomenon, sometimes called the 
‘Amazon effect’,3 can lower inflation, at least temporarily. 
On the other hand, some evidence appears to suggest that digitalisation in the retail trade leads 
to faster pass-through – that is to say, it increases the responsiveness of prices to shocks 
affecting the economy, such as the strong appreciation of a nation’s currency. Studies show 
that the growth of online trade in recent years may have helped to almost double the speed of 
price adjustments in the US retail industry.4 Switzerland too has seen a trend towards faster 
price adjustments over the last few years.5 Thus, shocks such as strong appreciation or 
depreciation of the Swiss franc could feed through to inflation more rapidly in the future. The 
SNB is therefore analysing the repercussions of digitalisation in depth, in order to understand 
the impact on inflation as thoroughly as possible and ensure that it is able to take action where 
necessary.  
  1 For a discussion about the causes and implications of low inflation, cf. Constâncio, Vítor (2017) ‘Understanding and overcoming low 
inflation’; remarks at conference on Understanding inflation: lessons from the past, lessons for the future? Frankfurt am Main,  
21–22 September. 
2 BAK Economics AG and Swiss Association of Distance Selling. 
3 This term describes the impact of booming online trade on the traditional retail trade as well as on economic growth and inflation.  
4 The costs to companies of price changes (‘menu costs’) are generally lower for online traders as they only have to modify their prices 
online; traditional traders on the other hand have to produce new labels, brochures, etc. Cf. Cavallo, Alberto (2018) ‘More Amazon effects: 
online competition and pricing behaviors’, Harvard Business School & NBER, 7 September. 
5 Swiss Federal Statistical Office data, for example, show that the share of goods and services subject to price adjustments rose from some 
20% per month in 2011 to just over 25% in 2017. 
  Page 3/9 
     As its responses both during and after the crisis have shown, the SNB has a monetary policy 
strategy that has proved its worth in highly volatile circumstances. Robust and appropriate, 
this framework offers the required room for manoeuvre, allowing the SNB to tolerate inflation 
temporarily moving outside the range it equates with price stability, provided inflation 
expectations remain well anchored.  
Innovations on the foreign exchange market 
As I have explained, the SNB must adapt its analysis continuously in order to understand and 
anticipate changes in the goods and services market. However, the latter is not the only 
market to have undergone profound changes. The foreign exchange market, too – a key 
market for the SNB – has also evolved considerably since the crisis. It is here that we conduct 
interventions, as required, and it is here that we actively manage our foreign exchange 
reserves. The SNB has had to adapt to ongoing changes taking place on this market as well to 
ensure that it is able to implement its monetary policy effectively at all times. 
For the last six years, the foreign exchange market has undergone profound change in three 
different but linked areas: the technology being used, the fragmentation of trading activity and 
the emergence of new players.  
As regards technology, the most notable development has been the shift towards pure 
e-trading. Algorithmic trading, high-frequency trading, artificial intelligence and machine 
learning are just some of the commonly used terms in e-trading. Over 70% of the transaction 
volume in the foreign exchange spot market now takes place electronically. The shift to 
e-trading has also increased the frequency of trades. As a result, information flows have risen 
considerably. Close monitoring of these markets thus requires greater data processing 
capabilities.  
The shift to e-trading has also led to the fragmentation of trading. With new forms of 
organised markets beginning to compete for the distribution of liquidity to end-users, 
transaction volumes on the primary interbank market have declined, in favour of new 
secondary market sites. Examples include secondary electronic communication networks, 
individual banks’ proprietary trading platforms and multi-bank platforms. Monitoring market 
activity has become increasingly complex as the number of sites has proliferated. 
Finally, the market participants themselves have changed. On the one hand, the share of 
transactions being executed by traditional bank dealers has steadily declined and this activity 
is being concentrated at the largest banks. On the other hand, new players have entered the 
market. In particular, companies specialising in high-frequency trading have become non-
bank market makers and have started providing liquidity to end-users on a direct and open 
basis. It is necessary to monitor these trends in order to understand their potential impact on 
market dynamics. 
What, practically speaking, do these changes mean for the SNB? Since the financial crisis and 
the decline of interest rates to very low levels, foreign exchange market intervention has 
  Page 4/9 
     become an important tool in the implementation of the SNB’s monetary policy. It is thus vital 
that we closely monitor structural and technological developments on this fast-paced market, 
and ensure that both our resources and our skillset are up to speed. In so doing, we stay on 
level pegging with market participants and optimise the desired effect when we intervene in 
the market. A thorough analysis of the market allows us to achieve the best possible trading 
conditions. 
I would now like to hand over to my colleague Thomas Moser. He will explain in greater 
depth how the SNB performs real-time monitoring of this fast-paced market.  
 
I would like to show you in more detail how the SNB uses high-frequency data to monitor 
the foreign exchange market in real time. 
We first had to refine our tools and skillset to keep pace with high-speed markets. The 
fragmentation of trading activity has caused a huge increase in the volume of data that 
needs to be collected, recorded and processed. To perform this task, we have invested in 
internal resources, especially for the analysis of high-frequency data. This gives us a better 
understanding of the microstructure of the markets that we use to implement our monetary 
policy.6 
Let me give you a concrete example of such an analysis. On 8 February 2018, the Swiss 
franc appreciated significantly against the euro in a matter of minutes. Chart 2 shows the 
limit order book for EURCHF on the interbank market between 17:00 and 17:45. The red 
bars represent the bid volume, and the blue bars the ask volume. The triangles denote the 
transactions carried out at the bid price (in red) and ask price (in blue), respectively. For 
each tick, the system records the volume on the bid and ask sides. The dark colours indicate 
more volume for a given price level.  
We can see that prior to 17:15, there was a liquid order book on both sides. Thereafter, a 
large number of EUR sell orders were executed; this was accompanied by a drop in bid 
volume and a downward revision of bid and ask prices. Price levels with high volume – as 
denoted by the darker red bars on the bid side – steadily declined to end up at CHF 1.1448 
per euro. After this short-lived episode, the euro gradually recovered in the minutes that 
followed.  
Now let’s look at the trading activity and market liquidity on that day. In the two panels of 
slide 3, the green curve represents the spot rate for EURCHF on 8 February 2018. The red 
curve represents two different variables: in the left-hand panel it denotes the intraday 
turnover for EURCHF, while in the right-hand panel it shows the bid-ask spread, which is 
an indicator of transaction costs. Finally, the salmon-coloured area shows the historical 
average. We can see that trading activity between 17:00 and 17:30 was above the historical 
 6 I should also add that knowledge-sharing between central banks has been stepped up at international level. Cf., for example, the report by 
the Bank for International Settlements, Monitoring of fast-paced electronic markets, 17 September 2018. 
   Page 5/9 
     average. By contrast, the bid-ask spread widened only slightly, before swiftly returning to 
normal levels. As a result, despite the strong Swiss franc appreciation, market liquidity 
remained strong. 
If we combine the information in these three charts, we can see that the Swiss franc 
appreciation recorded on 8 February was accompanied by high transaction volumes, but 
this was absorbed comparatively easily by the market. This example shows how we analyse 
the microstructure of the market in real time.  
But capturing micro-changes in real time is not enough to allow an understanding of the 
underlying market dynamics of the Swiss franc. Rather, we need to be able to tie them to 
longer-term trends, in other words a period spanning several weeks or months. Since the 
beginning of the year, for instance, we have observed three risk-off events that put upward 
pressure on the Swiss franc, as illustrated by the red curve in chart 4.  
First, last February, concerns surrounding a faster-than-expected tightening of monetary 
policy in the US triggered a major stock market sell-off and a corresponding volatility spike 
(green curve). Then, in May, political uncertainty in Italy led to a considerable widening of 
the yield spread between German and Italian 10-year bonds (blue curve). Demand for 
various asset classes regarded as safe havens, such as the Swiss franc, increased. Finally, in 
August, we witnessed a huge sell-off of certain emerging market currencies and an increase 
in their volatility (yellow curve). Fears of global contagion resulted in the franc 
appreciating strongly. It remains a safe-haven currency during periods of high uncertainty.  
Indeed, an analysis of the options market confirms that the Swiss franc was in demand as a 
safe-haven currency during the three events described above. Risk reversal shows that 
during these events, participants were prepared to pay a higher premium to hedge against 
losses resulting from a steep appreciation of the Swiss franc vis-à-vis the euro than against 
a depreciation. As we can see from chart 5, three-month risk reversal for the EURCHF pair 
was significantly negative. Even today, risk reversal is still well below zero, indicating that 
the situation on the foreign exchange market remains generally fragile. 
And now I would like to hand back to Andréa Maechler. 
 
As we have just seen, without this kind of in-depth analysis as a supplement to traditional 
macroeconomic analysis, it would not be possible for us to capture the complexity of markets 
simply and comprehensibly. Today, our communication on the Swiss franc is centred around 
two key statements: the currency remains highly valued, and the situation on the foreign 
exchange market is still fragile. By communicating our knowledge of the financial markets in 
a clear and simple way, we bolster participants’ confidence and contribute to the credibility of 
our monetary policy implementation. 
  Page 6/9 
     A changing money market 
Lastly, I’d like to take a look at another market that has seen profound change since the crisis: 
the money market. This market is particularly important for the SNB, especially with respect 
to the implementation and transmission of its monetary policy. 
The money market has undergone two major changes, largely driven by external factors. First, 
the structure of the market has evolved, with the inexorable decline of the unsecured segment 
and concomitant rise of the secured segment; this structural change has meant that repos now 
take centre stage on the money market. Second – and this change is closely bound up with the 
first – we observe that the framework conditions within which the money market operates 
have been recast following the decline of the unsecured segment. I am alluding here to the 
replacement of the Libor as the reference interest rate for a variety of financial products, both 
in Switzerland and around the world.  
Coming back to the first point: the drop in volume for unsecured transactions, particularly on 
long-dated operations (more than one month), is a global phenomenon. It reflects the banks’ 
loss of confidence in conducting transactions on an unsecured basis since the beginning of the 
financial crisis. This trend has not been reversed, as we can see from chart 6. Activity on the 
money market has shifted towards the secured segment – in Switzerland towards the repo 
market (shown in blue). Following the substantial injection of liquidity in the wake of the 
SNB’s interventions, activity in this segment has also declined. However, the sizeable 
liquidity surplus has not reduced volume to zero. In fact, the introduction of negative interest 
on sight deposit accounts at the SNB has prompted banks to arbitrage their exempted 
amounts. In addition, banks have continued to trade in repos, in order to exchange the 
corresponding collateral. Collateral management tends to gain in importance in response to 
ever-stricter regulation. Insurance companies are likewise active in the market, for liquidity 
management purposes.  
In this changing context, the money market has performed its role as a monetary policy 
transmission channel to the fullest extent. Following the introduction of a –0.75% negative 
interest rate on sight deposit accounts at the SNB at the beginning of 2015, the various money 
market interest rates rapidly moved into negative territory, as chart 7 shows. The decline also 
spread to yields on bond and credit markets. 
To ensure the smooth functioning of the capital market and the effective transmission of 
monetary policy regardless of the circumstances, the quality of the money market 
infrastructure plays a key role. The existing money market infrastructure managed by SIX has 
many advantages: for instance, it has a wide range of participants, including the SNB, who 
make up a homogeneous market and interact on a shared platform. Moreover, that 
infrastructure is highly automated and standardised. It is in the process of being upgraded, to 
better respond to the changing needs of participants. A new repo trading platform, CO:RE, 
was launched in 2016. Moreover, a new triparty agent is being set up which will offer market 
participants a wide range of services and will enable a more efficient management of 
collateral through closer integration with pure trading activities. 
  Page 7/9 
     Finally, a resilient and modern repo market infrastructure is essential to allow the SNB to 
deploy its entire monetary policy toolkit effectively and at any time. Indeed, the SNB uses the 
same SIX platform as private participants to implement its monetary policy, by 
auctioning/exchanging repos or reverse repos or even issuing SNB Bills. As you will recall, 
the latter were issued at the beginning of the crisis. They proved to be an efficient and flexible 
way to absorb liquidity. 
I will now turn to the second point: the replacement of the Libor as the reference money 
market interest rate. It should be noted that the decline in transaction volumes for the 
unsecured segment of the money market involves not just the Swiss franc but all currencies. 
As a result of this decline, the Libor, which is supposed to reflect the major banks’ unsecured 
refinancing costs, is now hardly ever based on effective transaction prices but instead relies 
almost exclusively on estimates. In response, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has 
announced that it will no longer maintain the Libor after 2021. All market players will have to 
make careful preparation for this.  
In Switzerland, work on replacing the Libor is already well advanced, but a complicating 
factor is the rate’s widespread use. The national working group on Swiss franc reference rates 
(NWG), which is in charge of ensuring a smooth transition, has identified SARON as the 
preferred alternative solution to the Libor.  
SARON has already established itself as a reference interest rate, and there is now an interest 
rate curve based on SARON. It is crucial to have a SARON-based curve capable of being 
used instead of the Libor curve, for price setting across the Swiss franc capital market. 
Amounts outstanding on the overnight swap market (OIS) based on SARON are currently 
low, but are likely to grow significantly in the future. In this connection, I would also like to 
mention that the first SARON-based futures contract was launched only around ten days ago, 
and traded on the Eurex platform. In the future, when products based on SARON (loans, 
mortgages, etc.) are brought to market, trading volumes for the associated collateral 
instruments will increase. These instruments, in turn, can be used for loan pricing.  
One of the challenges involved in replacing the Libor with an overnight rate such as SARON 
is how to determine forward rates that would, for example, allow the calculation of quarterly 
payments on contracts. At the moment, the derivatives market is not liquid enough to provide 
a prospective forward rate (i.e. one that is known in advance). This is why the working group, 
at its meeting last week, opted for a backward-looking calculation method based on the 
average of daily SARON rates over the period concerned. 
As co-chair of the NWG, the SNB is supporting the process by providing coordination at 
national level and encouraging dialogue at international level. Ultimately, though, only the 
market participants themselves can ensure a successful transition. It is thus critical that they 
become involved, keep themselves informed about the working group’s recommendations, 
and put them into practice. Participation in the working group is open to all those operating in 
  Page 8/9 
     the market. I should add that an information session on the working group’s latest activities 
and on future challenges will be taking place tomorrow in Geneva.7 
Before finishing, I would like to emphasise that the SNB retains its ability to steer interest 
rates even without the Libor. For instance, it is currently doing so by means of the negative 
interest rate on the sight deposits which the banks hold at the SNB. The disappearance of the 
Libor or the transition to another interest rate would change nothing in that respect. To date, 
in order to implement its monetary policy, the SNB has allowed the three-month Swiss franc 
Libor to fluctuate within a range. Obviously, this element of its strategy will have to change. 
The SNB will announce the requisite changes in due course. 
Conclusion 
Ladies and Gentlemen, to conclude:  
We have seen that, ten years on from the crisis, central banks’ basic mission has not 
fundamentally changed. However, the environment in which they operate has evolved and 
continues to do so. For this reason, it is essential that the SNB has a precise understanding of 
the changes it faces, and adapts itself in response, in order to ensure the continued and optimal 
fulfilment of its mandate.  
To date, the SNB has been able to rely on a sound strategy and on the skills and state-of-the-
art technologies that allow it to remain agile in a constantly changing world. I am convinced 
that it will continue to do so in the future.  
Thank you for your attention.
