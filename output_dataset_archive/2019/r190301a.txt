Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
Citizens Budget Commission 87th Annual Awards Dinner 
New York, New York 
February 28, 2019 
 It is a pleasure to speak here this evening at the 87th Awards Dinner.  Tonight I 
will start with the near-term outlook for the U.S. economy.  Then I will turn to a topic 
that is inspired by the Citizens Budget Commission’s mission statement, which focuses 
on the “well-being of future New Yorkers.”  I imagine that future New Yorkers attending 
this dinner in 50 years may not look back on the near-term outlook in February 2018 as 
very interesting or important.  So, tonight, after a brief review of the here and now, I will 
focus on an issue that is likely to be of more lasting importance:  the need for policies that 
will support and encourage participation in the labor force, promote longer-term growth 
in our rapidly evolving economy, and spread the benefits of prosperity as widely as 
possible.   
The State of the Economy and Near-Term Prospects 
Beginning with the here and now, Congress has charged the Federal Reserve with 
achieving maximum employment and stable prices, two objectives that together are 
called the dual mandate.  I am pleased to say that, judged against these goals, the 
economy is in a good place.  The current economic expansion has been under way for 
almost 10 years.  This long period of growth has pushed the unemployment rate down 
near historic lows (figure 1).  The employment gains have been broad based across all 
racial and ethnic groups and all levels of educational attainment as well as among the 
disabled (figure 2).1  And while the unemployment rate for African Americans and 
Hispanics remains above the rates for whites and Asians, the disparities have narrowed 
appreciably as the economic expansion has continued.  
                                                 
1 The unemployment rate of those with a disability and between the ages of 16 and 64 fell from more than 
16 percent in 2011 to less than 9 percent in 2018.  Meanwhile, their labor force participation rate has been 
rising over the past few years.  In 2018, about 8 percent of the population aged 16 to 64 reported 
themselves as having a disability, and their labor force participation rate was 33 percent.

Nearly all job market indicators are better than a few years ago, and many are at 
their most favorable levels in decades.  After lagging earlier in the expansion, wages and 
overall compensation--pay plus benefits--are now growing faster than a few years ago 
(figure 3).  It is especially encouraging that the labor force participation rate of people in 
their prime working years, ages 25 to 54, has been rising for the past three years.  More 
plentiful jobs and rising wages are drawing more people into the workforce and 
encouraging others who might have left to stay.   
In addition, business-sector productivity growth, which had been disappointing 
during the expansion, moved up in the first three quarters of 2018.  Rising productivity 
allows wages to increase without adding to inflation pressures.  Sustained productivity 
growth is a necessary ingredient for longer-run improvements in living standards.   
The price stability side of our mandate is also in a good place.  After remaining 
below our target for several years, inflation by our preferred measure averaged roughly 
2 percent last year (figure 4).  Inflation has softened a bit since then, largely reflecting the 
recent drop in oil prices.  Futures markets and other indicators suggest that oil prices are 
unlikely to fall further, and if this proves correct, oil’s drag on overall inflation will 
subside.  Consistent with that view, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and 
energy prices and often provides a better signal of where inflation is heading, is currently 
running just a touch below our 2 percent objective.  Signs of upward pressure on inflation 
appear muted despite the strong labor market.   
While the data I have discussed so far give a favorable picture of the economy, it 
is also important to acknowledge that not everyone has shared in the benefits of the 
expansion to the same extent, and that too many households still struggle to make ends

meet.2  In addition, over the past few months we have seen some crosscurrents and 
conflicting signals about the near-term outlook.  For instance, growth has slowed in some 
major economies, particularly China and Europe.  Uncertainty is elevated around some 
unresolved government policy issues, including Brexit and ongoing trade negotiations.  
And financial conditions have tightened since last fall.  While most of the incoming 
domestic economic data have been solid, some surveys of business and consumer 
sentiment have moved lower.  Unexpectedly weak retail sales data for December also 
give reason for caution.  
Given the positive outlook but also muted inflation pressures and the 
crosscurrents I just mentioned, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will be 
patient as we determine what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds 
rate may be appropriate to support our dual-mandate objectives.  This common-sense 
risk-management approach has served the Committee well in the past.   
I will turn now from the near-term outlook to the question of how the economy 
will perform over the long haul.   
Longer-Term Challenges and Opportunities 
From 1991 through 2007, the economy expanded annually at about 3 percent, 
similar to the pace for much of second half of the 20th century.  Since 2007, however, 
growth has averaged just 1.6 percent.  If the earlier 3 percent growth had persisted over 
the past 12 years, incomes today would be almost 20 percent higher than they now are.  
                                                 
2 For example, a Federal Reserve survey indicates that in early 2018, after nearly a decade of growth, as 
many as 40 percent of households were unprepared for an emergency expense of as little as $400.  Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018), Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households 
(Washington:  Board of Governors, May), available at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20180522a.htm.

From the standpoint of future Americans, if the slower growth persists for a half-century, 
incomes will end up roughly half of what they would have been.  
Why has growth slowed, and what can we do about it?  To understand the causes 
of the slowdown, it is useful to divide growth into two components:  (1) growth in the 
cumulative number of hours of worked by all workers and (2) growth in the amount of 
output derived, on average, from each hour of work.  We refer to output per hour of work 
as “labor productivity.”  From 1991 through 2007, when the economy expanded at a 
3 percent average rate, hours worked increased about 1 percent a year and economy-wide 
productivity grew about 2 percent (figure 5).3  Since 2007, both of these growth factors 
have slowed by about half, with hours worked annually increasing only 0.5 percent from 
2008 to 2018 and productivity rising just 1 percent on average.4   
Growth in hours worked has slowed, in part, because of slower U.S. population 
growth.  Birth rates have edged down, and immigration has slowed.  Not only is the total 
population growing more slowly, but the share of the population in their prime working 
years is falling steadily as the very large baby-boom generation is moving into retirement.  
Demographic factors are generally slow moving and predictable, and there is no surprise 
in the fact that slower population growth and the retirement of the baby boomers are now 
contributing to slower growth in the total amount of work performed in the economy.   
There is another factor contributing to the slower growth in hours, however, and 
this factor is more surprising and more troubling.  To be counted as “in the labor force,” a 
                                                 
3 These estimates are based on the Congressional Budget Office’s (2019) estimates for potential GDP for 
the Budget and Economic Outlook:  2019 to 2029 (Washington:  CBO, January), 
https://www.cbo.gov/publication/54918.  Economy-wide productivity includes the nonbusiness sector.

Economic Research, June), https://www.nber.org/papers/w23543.

person must either be employed or have looked for work within the past four weeks.  The 
share of people of working age who are actually in the labor force has fallen significantly 
since the late 1990s.  This decline raises the important question of why have people of 
working age increasingly chosen not to work.   
The data suggest that there are both positive and more problematic forces at work.  
For example, among those aged 16 to 24, participation in the labor market has fallen from 
about 65 percent in the 1990s to 55 percent now (figure 6).  But this drop in participation 
appears to reflect young people getting more education.  The fraction of this age group 
who are neither in school nor in the labor force has held fairly constant at around 
11 percent, and measures of school enrollment are up.5  Higher educational attainment is 
much more important in today’s job market than in the past, and investing in education 
today has long-term benefits for both the student and for society.6  Statistics confirm that 
higher educational attainment is associated with higher labor force participation, lower 
unemployment, and higher wages.   
Turning to those aged 25 to 54, the participation picture is more troubling.  
Among prime-age men, participation has been falling for more than 60 years, with the 
decline averaging about 1.5 percentage points per decade (figure 7).  For women, 
participation rose over the second half of the 20th century until peaking in the late 1990s.  
Since then, women’s participation has dropped just a bit.   
                                                 
5 It is also true that a smaller share of students are holding down a job while in school. 
6 For example, see Maria E. Canon, Marianna Kudlyak, and Yang Liu (2015), “Youth Labor Force 
Participation Continues to Fall, but It Might Be for a Good Reason,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 
Regional Economist (St. Louis, Mo.:  FRB St. Louis, January), 
https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/january-2015/youth-labor-force.

To put these numbers in context, let’s look at data from other advanced 
economies.  Prime-age male participation has fallen some across most of these economies 
since 1995 (figure 8).  But the decline in the United States has been much larger than 
most, and U.S. participation was below the middle of the pack at the outset.  As a result, 
the United States now has the fourth lowest participation rate among 34 advanced 
economies.  For women’s participation, the details are different, but the bottom line is 
similar.  In the mid-1990s, the United States ranked in the upper tier for prime-age 
women’s participation, but since then participation by women has advanced rapidly in 
many countries while it has declined slightly in the United States.  Now the United States 
is sixth lowest among these 34 countries.  
Researchers have investigated numerous possible reasons for the decline in prime-
age participation.  Among men, the drop in participation is much sharper for those with 
only a high school education or less.  The drop for women is also sharper for those who 
are high school educated.  This pattern is consistent with the idea that a modern economy 
demands ever-higher skills, and that workers without those skills are being left behind 
(figure 9).  But the international experience suggests that this outcome is not inevitable:  
The drop in participation among those with less education is much smaller in some 
comparable countries than in the United States.7   
The research into labor force participation in the United States and across the 
world does not find a magic fix, but it does suggest a variety of policies that might better 
prepare people for the modern workforce as well as support and reward labor force

participation.8  I should note that the Fed has neither the tools nor the mandate to directly 
address the forces that are holding back labor force participation.  We can contribute by 
fostering a strong labor market, in accordance with our mandate.  While it is not the Fed’s 
role to advocate particular labor force policies, I do want to put a spotlight on this 
important issue.  I strongly believe policies that bring prime-age workers into productive 
employment, particularly those who may have been left behind because of low skills or 
educational attainment, could bring great benefits both to those workers and to our 
economy.   
The second factor accounting for the slowdown in GDP growth is the slower pace 
of labor productivity growth, or output per hour worked.  When measured annually, labor 
productivity growth is volatile, but focusing on five-year averages, we can see that from 
1975 through 2007, productivity growth averaged about 2 percent while fluctuating 
between about 1 and 4 percent (figure 10).  Since then, growth seems to have settled at 
the low end of that historical range.  Unlike the situation with labor force participation, 
the slowdown in productivity growth is also evident in most advanced economies, and the 
U.S. experience is roughly comparable to that of other countries.   
There is an ongoing debate over the causes and implications of this global 
slowdown in productivity growth.  Some argue that the rapid growth seen over much of 
the 20th century was historically anomalous, and that we are destined to return to the 
slower growth of centuries past.  Others are more optimistic that strong growth can 
return.

Many have noted that during the current expansion, investment and capital 
accumulation have been lower than in previous expansions, so perhaps we just need to 
invest more.  Unfortunately, it does not seem to be that simple.  Standard reasoning holds 
that capital-per-worker drives productivity.  While we have had slower capital 
accumulation of late, we have also had slower growth in labor supply--hours worked.  
Thus, capital per worker, according to some analysis, has continued to increase roughly at 
its pre-recession trend.  In this view, the productivity problem is not simply one of 
inadequate investment.9   
Researchers have proposed several reasons why, even if the quantity of 
investment has kept up, recent investment may be leading to smaller productivity 
advances than in the past.  The more optimistic analysts argue that we may be in a 
productivity lull while businesses work to realize the full benefit of advances that are 
embedded in recent investment.10  Others suggest that productivity-advancing ideas are 
inherently harder to find and exploit than in the past, implying that slower productivity 
growth may be with us for the long haul.11  This debate is unlikely to be resolved anytime 
soon.  In the meantime, we should look for policies that will create an environment in 
which productivity can flourish.   
                                                 
9 See Fernald and others, “Disappointing Recovery,” in note 4. 
10 For example, Brynjolfsson, Mitchell, and Rock (2018) highlight the need to make complimentary 
investments in intangibles to take advantage of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies (see 
Erik Brynjolfsson, Tom Mitchell, and Daniel Rock (2018), “What Can Machines Learn and What Does It 
Mean for Occupations and the Economy?” AEA Papers and Proceedings, vol. 108 (May), pp. 43-47).  And 
Mokyr (2014) argues that the vast array of computers and other relatively new tools will usher in a new 
wave of progress just like the invention of barometers and microscopes and other tools propelled the 
technology in the 1700s (see Joel Mokyr (2014), “The Next Age of Invention,” City Journal, Winter). 
11 Bloom and others (2017) as well as Thompson and Spanuth (2018) discuss how it has become more 
costly to make technological advances.  See Nicholas Bloom, Charles I. Jones, John Van Reenen, and 
Michael Webb (2017), “Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find?” available at 
https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/papers.html; and Neil Thompson and Svenja Spanuth (2018), “The Decline 
of Computers As a General Purpose Technology:  Why Deep Learning and the End of Moore’s Law Are 
Fragmenting Computing,” available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3287769.

We need policies that support innovation and create a favorable environment for 
investment in both the skills of workers and the tools they have.  Indeed, the recent tax 
reforms were designed in part to boost capital investment and thus productivity.  Once 
again, my goal tonight is to highlight the importance of growth-enhancing policies.  
Because these policies are not the province of the Fed, I will not advocate for particular 
approaches.  Instead, I will just observe that researchers and policy analysts have 
proposed many promising ideas that may be capable of attracting wide support.  Policies 
that succeed in enhancing productivity growth would greatly benefit future generations of 
Americans.   
Conclusion 
To conclude, the United States is currently in the midst of one of the longest 
economic expansions in our history.  Unemployment is low and inflation is close to our 
2 percent objective.  My colleagues and I on the FOMC are focused on using our 
monetary policy tools to sustain those favorable conditions.   
Tonight I have also highlighted some longer-term challenges we face, including 
low labor force participation by prime-age workers and low productivity growth.  By 
promoting macroeconomic stability, the Fed helps create a healthy environment for 
growth.  But these longer-term issues require policies that are more in the province of 
elected representatives.  The nation would benefit greatly from a search for policies with 
broad appeal that could promote labor force participation and higher productivity, with 
benefits shared broadly across the nation.
