 Summary 
  The post-crisis Phillips curve makes 3 fundamental changes to the wage Philips curve: it 
uses observable variables only; it changes the paradigm from flow to stock; and it allows 
the curve to be non-stationary.  
  We  introduce  the  concept  of  a  cumulative  wage  gap  –  meaning  the  cumulative  gap 
between current wage and a peak reference wage value in the past. People relate to their 
peak gains in the past rather than to uncertain future gains. They judge their consumption 
decisions based on the relation between their current wages and their past wages, adjusted 
for inflation. 
  The shape of the post-crisis Phillips Curve expresses the theoretical  assumption that the 
inflation rate stays below its target until the cumulative real wage gap closes, and that it 
increases above its target when the cumulative real wage gap becomes positive.  
  We test our hypothesis using data for 35 OECD countries for the period 1990-2017. We 
are  able  to  confirm  our  hypothesis,  as  the  coefficients  have  the  expected  sign  and  are 
statistically  significant  for  the  OECD  panel  as  well  as  for  most  of  the  individual 
countries. 
  Bottom-line, inflation depends on the cumulative wage gap: it does not increase close to 
or above its target level until the cumulative real wage gap is closed. 
  For Phillips Curve to work, the loss of welfare from a negative cumulative real wage gap 
has to be fully compensated first – as a stock measure, not as a flow.  
  The policy implication from this finding is that, for those countries which have not closed 
their cumulative real wage gap (most of the developed economies), inflation will remain 
subdued until they close their cumulative wage gap.  
 Distinguished guests,  
I  would  like  to  thank  the  organizers,  Central  Banking,  for  inviting  me  to  speak  about  a 
very topical issue: subdued inflation.  
Inflation  has  been  subdued  in  the  post-crisis  years,  and  the  Phillips  Curve  has  failed  to 
explain it. It is probably the greatest mystery of the economic science in the last decade: where 
has the Phillips Curve gone? There are multiple references to the fact that the Phillips Curve has 
flattened  over  the  last  decade,  if  not  earlier  (to  mention  just  a  few:  Forder  (2014),  Leduc  and 
Wilson  (2017),  Borio  (2017),  Carney  (2017),  Cunliffe  (2017),  Praet  (2016,  2018),  Spencer 
(2017), Murphy (2018), Bullard (2018)). 
The  flattened  Phillips  Curve  and  the  lesser  link  between  inflation  and  unemployment, 
inflation  and  output  gaps,  or  inflation  and  wages,  have  multiple  explanations.  As  presented  in 
international  literature,  some  of  these  explanations  are:  de-anchoring  inflationary  expectations, 
the labor market slack, a lower natural rate of unemployment, changes in expectations regarding 
the real pay growth, the decoupling between growth and inflation, the role of global value chains 
1 
 in  keeping  prices  down,  the  role  of  migration  in  keeping  wages  down  in  the  countries  of 
destination, and others. While there is some truth in each and every of them, no alternative has 
been successfully suggested so far. 
I think that the Phillips Curve needs a reality-check.  If we want to explain inflation, we 
need to make some adjustments to the Phillips curve. The following presentation is based on two 
working  papers  that  I  recently  published  with  Center  for  European  Policy  Studies  (CEPS)i, 
respectively and Global Labor Organization (GLO)ii.  
Three major changes are needed to the Phillips curve.  
     First, we should work with observable variables only. The problem with econometric models 
which use non-observable variables is built-in: they tend to under-perform in bad times. Potential 
GDP is revised retroactively. The output gap depends on potential GDP. Plus, an economy can 
grow above its potential without being at its full employment (in particular, but not exclusively, 
in catching-up economies).  
     Any measure of unemployment is controversial, given the impact of insufficiently accounted 
factors such  as the underground economy, migration, inactivity, part-time employment. A non-
observable  measure  of  unemployment,  like  NAIRU,  is  even  more  debatable.  If  Central  Banks 
rest  their  decisions  solely  on  such  non-observable  variables,  they  are  at  risk  of  getting  them 
wrong.  True,  any  non-observable  variable  becomes  visible  at  some  point  in  the  form  of  a 
disequilibrium in other observable variables, among which the twin deficits (budget deficit and 
current account deficit). Yet, when this happens, it is usually too late for monetary policy.  
     Therefore, we drop the non-observable variables such as output gap, inflationary expectations 
and NAIRU – at least when the task at stake is to explain inflation in a post-crisis environment. 
Instead,  we  choose  to  use  observable  variables  only.  Since  wage  is  a  measurable,  reliable, 
accounted  for,  and  comparable  indicator,  we  focus  on  a  wage  Phillips  Curve  where  consumer 
prices inflation rate is explained by the difference between past wages and current wages.       
Second,  we  should  make  a  fundamental  change  of  paradigm  from  flow  to  stock.  To 
understand  the  consumers  behavior,  which  in  turn  influences  inflation,  we  introduce  the 
concept of a cumulative wage gap – meaning the cumulative gap between current wage and 
a  peak  reference  wage  value  in  the  past.  The  permanent  income  hypothesis  is 
fundamentally flawed in times of crisis, because of uncertainty of future income. The only 
certain  reference  value  lies  in  the  past,  not  in  the  future:  and  that  is  why  current 
consumption is influenced by past income.  
     Third, we should allow for the Phillips Curve to be non-stationary: it moves over time, and it 
is  absolutely  normal  to  do  so.  Reference  wage  values,  social  preferences,  jobs’  characteristics, 
skills’  endowments  and  even  Central  Banks’  targets,  they  all  change  over  time  –  hence,  the 
impact of cumulative wage gaps on inflation cannot be the same in different time periods. In fact, 
even Phillips (1958) mentioned that he ignored years in which import prices rise rapidly enough 
to  initiate  a  wage-price  spiral.  He  stated  that  his  hypothesis  that  the  rate  of  change  of  money 
wage rates can be explained by the level of unemployment is supported except in or immediately 
after such years. In doing that, he effectively acknowledged the non-stationarity of his curve. He 
referred to those years as events that occur very rarely except as a result of a war. Our approach 
embraces these events,  except  that in modern times it is  not war that makes the difference, but 
recessions; and recessions happen more often than wars. We try to explain what happens during 
and after recessions – which is exactly what is omitted by the original Phillips curve.  
Wages, as the most important source of income for most households around the globe, stand at 
the  basis  of  any  consumption  theory.  The  main  problem  with  the  prevailing  consumption 
theories  (Keynes’  consumption  function  (1936),  Modigliani’s  life-cycle  hypothesis  (1966)  and 
 2 
Friedman’s permanent income hypothesis (1957)) is their long-term approach. This puts them 
at odds with our rather short and medium-term perspective on inflation, especially in times 
of crisis.  
     Our approach is closer to Duesenberry (1952), who introduced relative income instead of the 
rate  of  change  of  income  as  the  explanation  of  the  differences  in  saving  at  the  same  level  of 
income.  He  referred  to  the  influence  of  past  living  standard  on  current  consumption.  Saving 
depends, he wrote, on the level of current income relative to higher incomes in previous  years. 
However, he stopped short of calling a wage gap or of considering the influence his consumption 
and saving theory may have on inflation.  
     What matters most for consumption during and after a crisis is not the unit change of income, 
the  savings  for  retirement,  or  the  future  income.  A  recession  is  a  game  –  changer.  A  global 
financial  crisis  is  a  global  game-changer.  In  a  recession,  the  transitory  component  of  income 
becomes  negative  not  only  for  one  person  or  for  a  small  group,  but  for  the  national  or  global 
economy. This makes it very difficult to predict future income. When nothing is steady anymore, 
the only valid reference remains the past income. 
     In a crisis, the reference is not ahead of us, but rather it is in the past. Retirement savings and 
linear employment prospects are uncertain. People relate to their peak gains in the not so distant 
past rather than to uncertain future gains. 
     Consumption does not depend only on current income and future expectations, but also 
on past income. 
     Stock is more relevant than flow, because people have a strong reference which is their 
previous income levels. People do not spend as much as before when their wage drops, and they 
spend  more  if  they  have  higher  wages.  While  this  is  intuitive  and  apparently  well  explained, 
everything is related to wage flows and to wage dynamics. We hold that we should account the 
stock  as  well,  meaning  the  cumulative  gap  between  current  levels  and  past  reference  levels  of 
income. 
     Cumulative  wage  gap  is  a  better  predictor  of  inflation  than  output  gap  because  it  is 
observable  and  it  refers  to  past  consumption  and  price  levels;  while  output  gap  is  non-
observable and it makes conservative assumptions for the future.  
     Past  wages  are  the  minimum  potential  wages  in  the  mind  of  wage  earners.  We  assume  that 
people judge their consumption decisions based on the relation between their current wages and 
their past wages, adjusted for inflation.  
     The  cumulative  real  wage  gap,  instead  of  nominal  wage,  is  the  explanatory  variable  in  our 
new Phillips Curve. The dependent variable is the inflation gap, which refers to the gap between 
inflation and the inflation target (or, in the absence of a target, an average value of inflation over 
a longer time-span).  
     Inflation  gap is a more relevant  variable for policy makers than the inflation rate because it 
puts  inflation  in  relation  to  a  desired  level.  A  negative  inflation  gap  means  more  demand-side 
measures  are  needed.  A  positive  inflation  gap  means  that  the  risk  of  overshooting  is  already 
present and policy tightening is required.  
     For  inflation,  the  reference  point  is  not  in  the  past  –  but  it  is  rather  a  normative  value, 
commonly agreed to be desirable for a given society at a given point in time.  
Please  bear  with  me  for  a  short  presentation  of  the  cumulative  wage  gap  model  (please 
see the attached slides).  
We start by defining the wage gap: 
                                                            𝑊𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑇𝑛 = 𝑊𝑇𝑛 − 𝑊𝑇0   
     3 
where 𝑊𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑇𝑛 is the real wage gap at time Tn, 𝑊𝑇𝑛 is the real wage at time Tn, and 𝑊𝑇0 is the real 
wage at time T0, the peak value of real wage in the reference period. 
     The cumulative real wage gap at time Tn is defined as: 
                                      𝑐𝑊𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑇𝑁 = ∑ 𝑊𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑇𝑛
𝑁
𝑛=1
= ∑ (𝑊𝑇𝑛 − 𝑊𝑇0)
𝑁
𝑛=1
      A theoretical graphical representation of the real wage and the cumulative real wage gap for a 
six-period model can be observed in the attached figures.   
     At time T0 real wage is at peak. Of course, wage earners are not aware of this peak until the 
next year, when real wage drops. 
     Area A is the cumulative real wage gap between T1 and T0, area B is the cumulative real wage 
gap between T2 and T1, area C is the cumulative real wage gap between T3 and T2, area D is the 
cumulative real wage gap between T4 and T3, area E is the cumulative real wage gap between T5 
and T4 and area F is the cumulative real wage gap between T6 and T5. 
     At time T1, when real wage W1 drops relative to the peak value W0, the cumulative real wage 
gap is the area A (equal to the real wage gap). At time T2, when real wage drops even further, the 
cumulative  real  wage  gap  is  the  sum  of  areas  A  and  B.  At  time  T3,  the  real  wage  starts  to 
increase, but  as it remains below the peak value, the cumulative real wage gap further deepens 
(A+B+C).  At  time  T4,  when  the  real  wage  increases  above  the  peak  reference  value,  the 
cumulative  real  wage  gap  starts  to  shrink  (A+B+C+D).  The  growth  of  real  wage  makes  the 
cumulative  real  wage  gap  to  close  at  time  T5  (A+B+C+D+E)  and  to  enter  into  the  positive 
territory at time T6 (A+B+C+D+E+F). 
     The  cumulative  real  wage  gap  for  the  above  6-period  model  is  described  in  the  chart. 
Therefore, equation (2) can be written as follows:  
                                  𝑐𝑊𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑇𝑁 = ∑ (𝑊𝑇𝑛 − 𝑊𝑇0)
 
 
      
where 𝐴𝑛 is the real wage gap between 𝑇𝑛 and 𝑇𝑛−1, expressed as area. 
     If  a  new  recession  comes  at  T7  (not  shown  in  the  figures),  the  new  peak  value  for  the  real 
wage is the one recorded at T6. 
The inflation gap is defined as the deviation from the central banks’ target: 
                                                 𝛱𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑇𝑛 = 𝛱𝑇𝑛 − 𝛱𝑇𝑛
where 𝛱𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑇𝑛 is the inflation gap at time Tn, 𝛱𝑇𝑛 is the inflation rate at time Tn, and 𝛱𝑇𝑛
central banks’ target at time Tn, or, in the absence of that, an average of long-time inflation. 
     A  theoretical  graphical  representation  of  the  inflation  gap  for  a  six-period  model  can  be 
observed in the attached figure.  
     At time T0, at the peak value of real wage, we assume that inflation rate is above the central 
bank’s  inflation  target,  given  the  inflationary  pressures  caused  by  high  wages.  Therefore, 
inflation gap at time T0 is positive. However, the relationship is valid even when this assumption 
does  not  hold.  As  wages  enter  an  adjustment  phase,  inflationary  pressures  fade  away  and 
inflation rate declines. Inflation gap turns negative and reaches a minimum at time T3, the same 
as the cumulative real wage gap. In the next stage, as wages resume growth, inflation rate starts 
rising, but it remains subdued, below the central bank’s inflation target, until time T5, when the 
cumulative  real  wage  gap  is  closed.  Afterwards,  wages  continue  to  increase  and  the  wage  gap 
widens in the positive territory. Consequently, inflationary pressures strengthen, pushing up the 
inflation rate above the central bank’s inflation target at time T6.

      The equation of the post-crisis Phillips Curve is written as follows: 
                               [𝛱𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑇𝑛]𝑁 = 𝑓([𝑐𝑊𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑇𝑛]𝑁) + [𝜀𝑇𝑛]𝑁

 + [𝜀𝑇𝑛]𝑁      
∗ ]𝑁 = 𝑓([∑ (𝑊𝑇𝑛 − 𝑊𝑇0)]𝑁)
     By  introducing  the  equations  for  inflation  gap  and  cumulative  real  wage  gap  into  relation 
(18), the post-crisis Phillips Curve becomes: 
𝑁
                                    [𝛱𝑇𝑛 − 𝛱𝑇𝑛
𝑛=1
where N is the period of time for which the Phillips Curve is evaluated and  𝜀𝑇𝑛 is the residual, 
which accounts for other variables influencing the inflation gap. 
     At  time  T0,  cumulative  real  wage  gap  is  considered  zero,  while  inflation  gap  is  considered 
positive. This is one of the reasons why the curve does not cross exactly at the intersection of the 
two  axes.  The  other  reason  relates  to  the  dynamic  (non-stationary)  feature  of  the  curve, 
expressing its different expected coefficients during different time periods. 
     The shape of the post-crisis Phillips Curve expresses the theoretical assumption that the 
inflation  rate  stays  below  its  target  until  the  cumulative  real  wage  gap  closes,  and  that  it 
increases above its target when the cumulative real wage gap becomes positive.  
     The graphical representation assumes different slopes before and after closing the cumulative 
real wage gap. A sharper slope after closing the cumulative real wage gap means that the same 
amount of a cumulative real wage gap leads to less inflation as the cumulative gap is negative, 
and  to  more  inflation  as  the  cumulative  gap  turns  positive.  We  will  test  separately  these  two 
assumptions: the shape of the curve and the break in the slopes. 
In terms of methodology, the analysis covers the OECD countries over the period 1990-
2017, except for the United States where the data covers the period 1989  – 2017. Data sources 
for wages and inflation are the OECD and the FRED databases (for US), annual data. The reason 
for  this  selection  is  the  availability  of  long-time  data  series  on  wages  at  OECD  (they  are  only 
available  since  1990),  while  for  US  the  FRED  database  allows  us  to  start  from  a  known  peak 
year,  which  was  1989.  We  used  the  following  date:  the  average  annual  wage  in  2017  constant 
prices at 2017 USD PPPs, exchange rate (national currency units/US dollar) and inflation (CPI) – 
annual  growth  rate,  from  the  OECD  database,  and  the  real  median  household  income  in  the 
United  States,  2017  CPI-U-RS  adjusted  dollars,  from  the  FRED  database.  We  transformed  the 
average annual wage into local currency for ensuring comparability with the inflation rate, which 
reflects changes in local prices. 
     Data  sources  for  the  inflation  target  of  central  banks  are  from  the  respective  central  banks’ 
websites. If a central bank targets a corridor rather than a level of the inflation rate, then the mid-
point of the target band is considered. 
    The  year  T0  is  the  peak  year.  We  define  a  wage  adjustment  episode  the  adjustment  in  real 
wages that follows after the peak year. For each wage adjustment episode in a country, the data 
sample starts at year T0 (the peak year) and it ends when a new peak is detected (at year T0 new – 
1). We apply this only if the cumulative real wage gap has been closed before reaching the new 
peak. If the cumulative wage gap has not been closed, then we continue to consider the new peak 
as  part  of  the  same  adjustment  episode.  A  wage  adjustment  episode  within  a  larger  wage 
adjustment  episode  is  not  considered.  This  approach  prevents  data  overlapping  and  it  secures 
research consistency and integrity.   
     In the analysed period, there were three historical episodes of wage adjustments. Data shows 
that the cumulative real  wage gap was closed in  all countries which experienced the first wage 
adjustment  episode,  with  the  exception  of  two  countries  (Japan  and  Korea).  In  the  case  of  the 
second wage adjustment episode, the cumulative real wage gap has not yet been closed, with the 
exception of other two countries (Mexico and Latvia). These latter two countries entered a new 
wage adjustment episode, the third one.  
     For simplicity reasons, the wage adjustment episodes are numbered with reference to the time 
periods  and  not  to  the  country-specific  episodes.  We  considered  as  the  first  wage  adjustment 
5 
 episode any episode which started in the last decade of last century (1990-1999) and the second 
wage adjustment episode any episode which started after the year 2000. For example, Canada did 
not have a wage adjustment during the first historical period, but it experienced one during the 
second period. We refer to the latter as the second episode of wage adjustment in Canada.  
     Peak years are country-specific; hence they are not the same in all countries. This means that 
the  first  wage  adjustment  episode,  including  the  peak  years,  may  have  lasted,  for  example,  7 
years in Italy, 8 years in Germany and France, 9 years in US, 20 years in Korea or 28 years (and 
counting) in Japan. 
     Of  the  35  countries  analysed,  21  countries  experienced  the  first  historical  episode  of  wage 
adjustments,  33  countries  experienced  the  second  historical  episode  of  wage  adjustments  and 
only 2 countries experienced the third historical episode of wage adjustments.  
     This is why the total number of observations is much higher for the second wage adjustment 
episode,  compared  against  the  first  wage  adjustment  episode.  In  the  case  of  the  third  wage 
adjustment episode, the total number of observations is much lower. 
      And now we move to the juicy part. We present the graphical representation of our results for 
all  OECD  countries  which  experienced  wage  adjustments  (21  countries  for  the  first  wage 
adjustment episode and 33 countries for the second wage adjustment episode). 
The  results  are  statistically  significant  and  with  the  expected  sign  for  the  first  two  adjustment 
episodes.  For  the  third  adjustment  episode,  the  sign  of  the  relationship  is  as  predicted,  but  the 
number of observations is too limited to have statistical significance.  
     The theoretical model is confirmed: the cumulative wage gap explains a significant part 
of the deviation of inflation from its target: more than one third of the inflation gap in the 
first  wage  adjustment  episode  and  more  than  one  fifth  of  it  in  the  second  adjustment 
episode (which has not been closed yet). We also present graphical representations for selected 
countries which have statistically significant coefficients.  
     For the first wage adjustment episode the cumulative wage gap explains more than 60% 
of the inflation gap in Iceland, about two thirds of the inflation gap in the US and Ireland, 
more  than  half  the  inflation  gap in  Finland  and Switzerland,  close  to  half  of  the  inflation 
gap  in  Netherlands.  It  even  explains  almost  one  quarter  of  the  inflation  gap  in  Korea, 
despite the fact that this country has not closed the first wage adjustment episode yet.  
     For the second wage adjustment episode, the cumulative wage gap, which in most cases 
has not been closed yet, explains more than 60% of the inflation gap in Slovenia and Slovak 
Republic, between 40% and 60% of the inflation gap in Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, 
and  between  20%  and  40%  of  the  inflation  gap  in  Australia,  Canada,  Denmark,  France, 
Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zeeland, Switzerland and United States. 
     We  checked  the  robustness  of  our  results  separately,  in  the  standard  method,  as  well  as  the 
log-normalized method. 
      The results confirm the strong relation between cumulative real wage gap and inflation gap in 
the  OECD  countries.  Cumulative  real  wage  gap  explains  a  large  share  of  the  inflation  gap,  in 
particular  in  the  countries  which  experienced  severe  economic  recessions  and  subsequent 
material wage adjustments.  
    When  aggregated  for  all  OECD  countries,  having  a  large  number  of  observations  (197 
for the first wage adjustment and 525 for the second one), the estimated slopes of the post-
crisis  Phillips  Curve  are  statistically  significant  at  the  5%  level,  in  case  of  the  first  wage 
adjustment  episode,  and  at  the  1%  level,  in  case  of  the  second  wage  adjustment  episode. 
The coefficients’ sign is positive, in line with the theoretical assumptions.

The  individual  results  also  confirm  the  strong  and  positive  relation  between  cumulative 
real  wage  gap  and  inflation  gap.  In  the  case  of  the  first  wage  adjustment  episode,  out  of  21 
countries, 8 of them have positive and statistically significant coefficients; other 7 countries have 
positive  but  not  statistically  significant  coefficients,  while  the  remaining  6  countries  have 
negative but not statistically significant coefficients.  In the case of the second wage adjustment 
episode,  out  of  33  countries,  16  of  them  have  positive  and  statistically  significant  coefficients; 
other 9 countries have positive but not statistically significant coefficients, while the remaining 8 
countries have negative coefficients, out of which only 2 are statistically significant. Regarding 
the  third  wage  adjustment  episode,  out  of  2  countries,  one  has  positive  and  statistically 
significant slopes and one has positive but not statistically significant slopes.  
     The minority negative or not statistically significant coefficients could be attributed to the low 
number  of  observations,  as  well  as  to  various  specific  factors  that  temporarily  interrupted  the 
positive and strong relation between cumulative real wage gap and inflation gap.  
      The estimated coefficients of cumulative real wage gap using the log-normalized data point 
to  robust  results  and  are  more  meaningful  for  policy  makers.  Results  show  that  an 
increase/decrease  of  cumulative  real  wage  gap  by  10%  led  inflation  gap  to  rise/deepen  by 
0.561% during the first wage adjustment episode, by 0.846% during the second wage adjustment 
episode and by 0.454% during the third wage adjustment episode. 
     We  deepen  the  robustness  check  analysis  and  test  if  the  inflation  gap  accelerates  after  the 
cumulative real wage gap closes. In that respect, we estimated the slope of the post-crisis Phillips 
Curve  before  and  after  the  cumulative  real  wage  gap  was  closed.  The  results  in  the  standard 
method, as well as the log-normalized method are presented attached.  
    The  log-normalized  results  show  that  a  fall  of  the  cumulative  real  wage  gap  by  10% 
corresponds to a decline of the inflation gap by 0.9%. On the other hand, a 10% increase of the 
cumulative real wage gap after closes leads to an increased inflation gap by 2.2%. 
     This  confirms  the  theoretical  prediction  that  there  a  break  in  the  slope  of  the  curve,  as  the 
coefficients are higher after the cumulative wage gap closes than before this happens.  
      Bottom-line, inflation depends on the cumulative wage gap: it does not increase close to 
or above its target level  until  the cumulative real  wage gap is  closed. For Phillips Curve to 
work, the loss of welfare from a negative cumulative real wage gap has to be fully compensated 
first – as a stock measure, not as a flow. The policy implication from our finding is that countries 
which  closed  their  cumulative  real  wage  gap  should  be  much  more  prudent  in  further  wage 
increases – because they will be seen in inflation much faster and larger than in the recent past. 
For  countries  which  have  not  closed  their  cumulative  real  wage  gap  the  implication  is  that 
inflation will remain subdued until they close their cumulative wage gap.  
     Monetary policy cannot work in isolation. Its efficiency is influenced by the fiscal policy, 
by the wage policy in both the public and the private sector. Monetary policy is not a new-born. 
It matters that we did not only last summer, but quite some time ago. 
My  two  daughters,  now  10  and  6  years  of  age,  are  still  fascinated  by  the  Disney’s 
animation  “Frozen”.  In  that  movie,  Princess  Elsa  convincingly  sings  that  “Past  is  in  the  past”. 
However, fairytales do not apply in real life. The past still influences our current consumption 
choices, and therefore inflation and monetary policy decisions.  
Moreover,  monetary  policy  is  less  effective  if  it  is  done  from  an  ivory  tower. 
Theoretical models, as captivating intellectual efforts as they are, need a reality check from time 
to  time.  The  signs  are  here  for  us  all  to  see.  In  another  fascinating  Disney  movie,  “Tangled”, 
princess Rapunzel follow the signs she spots in the sky to beat its fears and escape from its ivory 
tower. I think we should do the same. Outside central banks, the greatest danger is populism.

The fact  that in  so many developed countries the  cumulated  wage  gap has not  been closed not 
only subdues inflation, but it also fuels dissatisfaction of voters giving rise to populism. Inside 
central banks, the greatest danger is dogmatism. We need to fight both with common sense, 
with  more  data-dependent  policies,  and  with  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  factors 
influencing consumer choices and society as a whole.
