Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices 
and Monetary Policy 
Speech at a Meeting Held by the Naigai Josei Chosa Kai 
(Research Institute of Japan) in Tokyo 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
It  is  my  pleasure  to  have  the  opportunity  to  address  you  today  at  the  Naigai  Josei  Chosa 
Kai. 
 At the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held at the end of last month, the Bank updated its 
projections for Japan's economic activity and prices through fiscal 2021 and released them 
in the April 2019 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report). In addition, 
with  a  view  to  making  clearer  its  policy  stance  to  persistently  continue  with  powerful 
monetary  easing,  the  Bank  decided  to  take  some  additional  monetary  policy  measures. 
Today, I would like to talk about the Bank's outlook for Japan's economic activity and prices 
based on the Outlook Report, as well as its current thinking behind the conduct of monetary 
policy, including the decision at the recent MPM. 
 I. Economic Developments 
Developments in Overseas Economies 
Let  me  start  by  talking  about  developments  in  overseas  economies.  Overseas  economies 
have  been  growing  moderately  on  the  whole,  but  slowdowns  have  been  observed  recently 
(Chart 1). Unlike the synchronous growth of the global economy seen through the first half 
of last year, differences in growth rates among regions and industries have become evident. 
While  the  U.S.  economy  has  continued  to  expand  firmly,  relatively  weak  developments 
increasingly  have  been  observed  in  the  Chinese  economy  because  economic  activity  has 
been  hampered  by  the  trade  friction  between  the  United  States  and  China  as  well  as 
adjustments  in  the  IT  sector,  in  addition  to  the  impact  of  authorities'  measures  to  push 
forward with deleveraging. As for Europe, production has declined since the second half of 
last  year,  mainly  in  Germany,  reflecting  the  tightening  of  gas  emission  regulations  on 
automobiles within the European Union (EU), and weaker exports to Turkey and China also 
have  been  exerting  downward  pressure  on  the  European  economy  recently.  Under  these 
circumstances, in the latest forecasts released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last 
month, the global economic growth rate for 2019 is projected to be 3.3 percent, which was 
further revised somewhat downward from the previous forecasts released in January. Thus, 
the growth rate for this year is likely to fall slightly below the long-term average since 1980 
of 3.5 percent. 
 1 
Current Situation of Japan's Economic Activity 
With  the  global  economy  decelerating,  Japan's  exports  and  production  have  shown  some 
weakness  recently  (Chart  2).  Exports  have  decreased  since  the  turn  of  the  year,  mainly  in 
terms  of  capital  goods  and  IT-related  goods  to  China,  and  this  has  led  to  the  weakness  in 
production  and  deterioration  in  business  sentiment  in  the  manufacturing  sector.  However, 
weakness in overseas economies so far does not appear to have spread clearly to domestic 
demand.  Business  fixed  investment  has  continued  on  an  increasing  trend,  with  corporate 
profits staying at favorable levels on the whole (Chart 3). According to our March Tankan 
(Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan), business fixed investment plans for 
fiscal  2019  showed  relatively  high  growth  for  this  time  of  the  year,  exceeding  the  past 
average.  Private consumption also  has  been increasing  moderately  against  the  background 
of steady improvement in the employment and income situation. Meanwhile, demand from 
foreign visitors, which temporarily declined in the second half of last year due to the effects 
of  the  successive  natural  disasters,  has  recovered  clearly  again.  Thus,  in  Japan,  a  virtuous 
cycle  from  income  to  spending  has  been  maintained  in  both  the  corporate  and  household 
sectors, although some weakness has been observed in exports and production. On this basis, 
the Bank judges that Japan's economy has been on a moderate expanding trend. 
 As  seen  in  the  current  economic  phase,  a  situation  where  the  slowdown  in  overseas 
economies  pushes  down  Japan's  economy  also  was  observed  from  mid-2015  through  the 
first half of 2016. Many people remember this as the so-called China shock, and not a few 
have pointed out its similarity with the current phase. However, looking more closely, there 
also seem to be some differences between then and now (Chart 4). First is the degree of the 
declines  in  exports  and  production.  Unlike  at  the  time  of  the  China  shock,  exports  and 
production fell significantly in the current phase. The fact that the assessment of the Indexes 
of Business Conditions released by the Cabinet Office this week turned to "worsening" for 
the  first  time  since  January  2013  is  largely  attributable  to  the  recent  declines  in 
production-related  indicators.  Of  course,  on  this  point,  it  is  necessary  to  take  into 
consideration that these, to some extent, are reactionary declines to significant increases  in 
exports and production in the past few years. In fact, although exports and production have 
decreased,  their  levels  have  remained  higher  than  those  during  the  China  shock.  Second, 
developments  in  financial  and  commodity  markets at  home and  abroad  differ  between  the 
 2 
two  phases.  Crude  oil  prices  fell  substantially  to  just  below  30  dollars  per  barrel  through 
February  2016;  in  the  foreign  exchange  market,  the  yen  rapidly  appreciated  against  the 
dollar after the turn of 2016, from the range of 120-130 yen to below 100 yen. On the other 
hand,  in  the  current  phase,  although  crude  oil  prices  and  financial  markets  at  home  and 
abroad temporarily became unstable from last autumn through the year-end and the start of 
this  year,  they  both  subsequently  have  regained  stability.  We  are  at  least not  in a  situation 
where  developments  in  financial  markets  worsen  firms'  and  households'  sentiment  and 
thereby push down economic activity. Third,  as I mentioned earlier, domestic demand and 
business sentiment of the nonmanufacturing sector have been firm in the current phase  on 
the  back  of  favorable  corporate  profits  and  improvement  in  the  employment  and  income 
situation.  Under  such  circumstances,  the  output  gap,  which  represents  the  utilization  of 
capital and labor, exceeded the long-term average of 0 percent in the second half of 2016, 
and  since  then  has  remained  clearly  positive.  Thus,  it  can  be  assessed  positively  that  the 
robustness  of  Japan's  economy  against  external  shocks  has  been  increasing  steadily  amid 
the economic expansion that is said to be the longest in the post-war era. 
 Outlook for Economic Activity 
Next, I will talk about the outlook for Japan's economy.  As shown in the Outlook Report, 
the  Bank  projects  that  Japan's  economy  is  likely  to  continue  on  an  expanding  trend 
throughout the projection period -- that is, through fiscal 2021 -- despite being affected by 
the slowdown in overseas economies for the time being (Chart 5). In terms of the median of 
the Policy Board members' forecasts, the real GDP growth rate is projected to be 0.8 percent 
for fiscal 2019, 0.9 percent for fiscal 2020, and 1.2 percent for fiscal 2021. 
 There are two important points regarding this outlook for economic activity (Chart 6). First 
is  future  developments  in  overseas  economies.  Although  slowdowns  have  been  observed 
recently, the Bank does not consider that overseas economies will continue to deteriorate all 
the  way.  The  U.S.  economy  --  the  growth  engine  of  the  global  economy  --  is  expected  to 
maintain its expansion, mainly supported by expansionary fiscal policy. As for the Chinese 
economy,  the  effects  of  stimulus  measures  already  have  materialized  in  part,  and  such 
moves  are  likely  to  become  more  widespread.  The  European  economy  is  projected  to 
gradually move out of its deceleration phase as the effects of temporary factors such as the 
 3 
tightening  of  gas  emission  regulations  on  automobiles  are  likely  to  dissipate.  Taking 
account  of  these  developments,  overseas  economies  are  expected  to  start  picking  up, 
although slowdowns are likely to continue for the time being. What matters is the timing of 
the pick-up. On this point, the IMF forecasts that the global economic growth rate will start 
rising again in the second half of this year. According to our interviews of firms, not a few 
hold the view that global demand for IT-related goods will hit bottom in the second half of 
this  year.  As  overseas  economies  pick  up,  Japan's  exports  are  projected  to  return  to  their 
moderate increasing trend without much delay. 
 Of  course,  there  are  various  uncertainties  regarding  this  outlook.  For  example,  Chinese 
authorities have been implementing stimulus measures that focus on such factors as tax cuts 
this time around while taking account of the balance between stimulating economic activity 
and  deleveraging,  based  on  the  recognition  that  large-scale  infrastructure  investment  after 
the  global  financial  crisis  subsequently  led  to  the  problems  of  excess  production  capacity 
and  excess  debt.  Thus,  whether  the  recent  measures  will  have  immediate  effects  as  in  the 
past  may  largely  affect  the  timing  of  a  pick-up  in  overseas  economies  going  forward. 
Developments  in  demand  for  IT-related  goods  such  as  semiconductors  remain  highly 
uncertain,  and  there  is  a  possibility  that  inventory  adjustments  on  a  global  basis  will  take 
longer  than  expected.  The  final  outcomes  of  such  issues  as  the  trade  friction  between  the 
United  States  and  China and  negotiations  on  the  United  Kingdom's  exit  from  the  EU  also 
remain unclear. Although there is no need to focus particularly on risk factors and become 
excessively  cautious,  the  Bank  considers  it  important  to  constantly  examine  risks  to  the 
outlook without preconception. 
 The  second  important  point  in  forecasting  future  developments  is  the  sustainability  of 
domestic demand. In order for Japan's economy to continue expanding moderately without 
interruption,  it  is  necessary  to  maintain  firm  domestic  demand  until  overseas  economies 
pick up. On this point,  private consumption is expected to continue increasing  moderately 
for  the  time  being  as  the employment  and  income situation  continues  to improve  steadily. 
The  fact  that  public  investment  is  expected  to  increase,  mainly  led  by  infrastructure 
investment reflecting policy measures for national resilience, also is likely to contribute to 
underpinning  economic  activity  going  forward.  What  holds  the  key  is  developments  in 
 4 
business  fixed  investment.  So  far,  the  impact  of  the  slowdown  in  overseas  economies 
cannot be observed clearly in business fixed investment plans for this fiscal year, and in the 
nonmanufacturing  sector  where  labor  shortage  has  continued,  many  firms  seem  to  have 
more  active  investment  plans  than  last  year,  mainly  regarding  labor-saving  investment. 
However, business fixed investment plans at this time of the year have a strong tendency to 
be  based  on  rough  estimates,  and  attention  should  be  paid  to  the  possibility  that  firms' 
investment stance will become cautious in mainly the manufacturing sector, if a pick-up in 
overseas economies  takes longer than expected going  forward. As  I mentioned earlier, the 
robustness  of  Japan's  economy  has  increased,  mainly  on  the  back  of  favorable  corporate 
profits.  Nevertheless,  the  Bank  will  closely  monitor  future  developments  as  there  is  a 
possibility 
that  firms'  and  households'  sentiment  will  be  affected  depending  on 
developments in overseas economies and financial markets. 
 II. Price Developments 
Current Situation of Prices 
Next, I will talk about price developments. The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer 
price  index  (CPI)  has  continued  to  show  relatively  weak  developments  compared  to  the 
economic  expansion  and  the  labor  market  tightening  (Chart  7).  However,  the  basic 
mechanism  has  been  operating  in  which  a  positive  output  gap  --  a  rise  in  the  level  of 
economic activity -- results in moderate increases in wages and prices. For example, at this 
year's annual spring labor-management wage  negotiations, the rate of increase in base pay 
started out lower than last year in early spring, mainly for large firms, but thereafter the rate 
of increase for small and medium-sized firms turned out to be relatively high, due to such 
factors as acute labor shortage. Eventually, the rate of increase in base pay as a whole was at 
about  the  same  level  as  last  year.  The  year-on-year  rate  of  increase  in  hourly  wages  of 
part-time employees also has continued to mark relatively high growth in the range of 2-3 
percent. 
 Such developments, together with a rise in prices of raw materials, will lead to an increase 
in costs for firms. Thus, firms have been proceeding with reflecting these rises in prices of 
their products and services, albeit slowly (Chart 8). Looking at the diffusion index (DI) for 
output  prices  in  the  Tankan,  the  situation  has  continued  for  over  a  year  in  which  the 
 5 
proportion of enterprises answering that the output prices have risen exceeds the proportion 
of those answering that such prices have fallen. This has occurred for the first time in about 
30 years since the bubble period. Prices of services traded in the corporate sector also have 
risen  steadily,  mainly  against  the  background  of  an  increase  in  distribution  costs 
accompanying  labor  shortage.  From  consumers'  perspective,  moves  to  raise  retail  prices 
have been spreading recently, mainly in terms of food products. Of course, a rise in prices 
of  food products and  daily necessities is not favorable for households, if focusing only on 
the  rise.  What  is  important  is  that  the  employment  and  income  situation  improves  to  an 
extent that households can accept such price rises. The Bank's monetary policy also aims at 
creating a virtuous cycle in which the inflation rate rises moderately in line with increases in 
corporate  profits  and  wages.  With  a  view  to  further  pushing  forward  with  such  a  virtuous 
cycle, the Bank strongly hopes that positive efforts by both labor and management toward 
raising wages will become more widespread. 
 Outlook for Prices 
Let me now move on to the outlook for prices. In the latest Outlook Report, the medians of 
the Policy Board members' forecasts of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI excluding 
fresh  food  are  1.1  percent  for  fiscal  2019,  1.4  percent  for  fiscal  2020,  and  1.6  percent  for 
fiscal 2021, which is the end of the projection period (Chart 9). 
 As this shows, the pace of increase in the CPI in Japan is likely to remain moderate. While 
there are various reasons for this, one of them is that the mindset and behavior based on the 
assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have been deeply entrenched, due 
mainly  to  the  experience  of  prolonged  low  growth  and  deflation,  and  changing  this  is 
expected to take time. This past experience and people's cautious mindset based on it lead to 
a situation where prices in Japan will not rise easily, due mainly to two channels. The first is 
the  possibility  that  firms'  stance  will  not  shift  as  much  as  theoretically  expected  toward 
further  raising  wages  and  prices,  even  when  the  output  gap  improves.  Both  labor  and 
management  in  Japan  still  have  a  persistent  tendency  to  place  priority  on  the  stability  of 
employment  over  wage  increases,  due  mainly  to  the  experience  of  severe  employment 
adjustments  under  deflation.  One  example  of  this  situation  is  the  fact  that  the  pace  of 
increase in wages has been sluggish compared to the degree of labor shortage. The second 
 6 
channel  is  that  it  is  likely  to  take  time  for  inflation  expectations  to  rise.  Per  orthodox 
thinking, a mutual feedback between actual prices and inflation expectations is assumed to 
operate. That is, if actual prices increase, people's inflation expectations also will rise, and if 
inflation  expectations  rise,  actual  prices also  will increase.  If  firms  and  households  expect 
that  wages  and  prices  will  not  increase  easily,  this  feedback  will  not  operate  smoothly.  In 
this context, recent studies point out that people's inflation expectations tend to depend not 
only on developments in actual prices, but also individuals' experiences over a long period. 
Thus,  there  also  is  a  possibility  that  average  inflation  expectations  will  not  rise  readily  as 
the ratio of the generation that has spent much of their life under deflation increases. 
 However, there is no need to be too pessimistic about the current situation. It is a significant 
change in Japan's economy that the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh 
food  has  remained  at  a  level  close  to  1  percent  for  more  than  one  year,  owing  to  an 
improvement  in  the  output  gap.  The  behavior  and mindset  under  deflation  also  have  been 
changing  gradually,  as  evidenced  by  the  fact  that  base  pay  increases  have  been  conducted 
for  six  consecutive  years  (Chart  10).  Under  such  circumstances,  although  inflation 
expectations  have  remained  more  or  less  unchanged  on  the  whole,  those  of  mainly 
households recently have risen somewhat. As people have gained the collective experience 
of increases in wages and prices in the past few years, it is likely to contribute to pushing up 
inflation expectations going forward. In this way, the momentum toward achieving the price 
stability target has been maintained, whereby a positive output gap results in an increase in 
actual  prices,  leading  to  a  rise  in  inflation  expectations.  The  Bank  projects  that  the 
year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI  is  likely  to  increase  gradually  toward  2  percent, 
although this will still take time. 
 III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy 
Now,  I  would  like  to  explain  the  Bank's  conduct  of  monetary  policy.  The  Bank  currently 
adopts the policy framework of "Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with 
Yield  Curve  Control."  Under  the  framework,  it  sets  the  short-term  policy  interest  rate  at 
minus 0.1 percent and the target level of 10-year JGB yields at around zero percent, and has 
conducted purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) in the market so that the yield 
curve would be formed in line with this guideline (Chart 11). By conducting this operation, 
 7 
short-  and  long-term  interest  rates  in  financial  markets  have  been  stable  at  low  levels  and 
lending rates for firms as well as issuance rates for corporate bonds also have remained at 
extremely low levels. The Bank aims at achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at 
the earliest possible time through powerful monetary easing centered on yield curve control. 
Meanwhile,  at  the  MPM  held  at  the  end  of  last  month,  Policy  Board  members  shared  the 
recognition that there are high uncertainties regarding the outlook for economic activity and 
prices in Japan, including developments in overseas economies, and that it is likely to still 
take time to achieve the price stability target. 
 Based  on  this  recognition,  the  Bank  judged  it  important  to  make  it  clearer  that  its  policy 
stance to persistently continue with the current powerful monetary easing toward achieving 
the price stability target has not changed (Chart 12). Thus, it decided at the April MPM  to 
clarify  forward  guidance  for  policy  rates  introduced  in  July  2018.  Forward  guidance  is  a 
measure that makes clear the stance on future policy rates in advance in order to strengthen 
market  confidence  and  expectations  regarding  monetary  policy.  Specifically,  a  part  of  the 
existing  guidance  was  revised,  thereby  making  clear  that  the  Bank  would  "maintain  the 
current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of 
time,  at  least  through  around  spring  2020,  taking  into  account  uncertainties  regarding 
economic activity and prices including developments in overseas economies and the effects 
of the scheduled consumption tax hike." The point of this revision is that a specific period 
of  "at  least  through  around  spring  2020"  was  added  to  clarify  the  meaning  of  "for  an 
extended  period  of  time,"  during  which  the  Bank  intends  to  maintain  the  current  interest 
rate  levels.  This  takes  into  consideration  that  (1)  pick-ups  in  overseas  economies  and  the 
global cycle for IT-related goods are expected to be seen in the second half of this year or 
onward  and  (2)  it  is  projected  to  take  some  time  to  examine  the  effects  of  the  scheduled 
consumption  tax  hike  after  its  implementation.  On  this  basis,  I  would  like  to  reemphasize 
that  the  current  forward  guidance  is  a  framework  in  which  the  Bank  makes  judgments 
depending on economic and price developments by using data and information available at 
the  time,  as  it  says  that  the  Bank  will  make  judgments,  taking  into  account  uncertainties 
regarding  economic  activity  and  prices.  While  economic  activity  and  prices  are  likely  to 
remain  in  a  state  where  the  current  extremely  low  levels  of  short-  and  long-term  interest 
rates  would  be  appropriate,  at  least  through  around  spring  2020,  the  Bank  considers  that 
 8 
there  is a  fair  possibility  that the  current  low interest  rates  will  be maintained  beyond  this 
period depending on future developments. 
 In addition, the Bank also decided at the MPM held at the end of last month to implement 
various measures contributing to the continuation of the current powerful monetary easing. 
Specifically,  it  decided  on  such  measures  as  expanding  the  range  of  eligible  collateral  for 
such  purposes  as  the  Bank's  lending  to  financial  institutions,  and  relaxing  the  terms  and 
conditions  for  the  facility  of  temporarily  lending  Japanese  government  securities  (JGSs) 
held by the Bank. In addition, the Bank decided to consider the introduction of a facility for 
lending exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that it holds to market participants. While I will not 
explain  these  measures  in  detail  today,  they  all  will  provide  support  for  continuing  with 
powerful  monetary  easing  through  the  Bank's  smooth  fund-provisioning  and  securing  of 
market  functioning.  In  combination  with  the  clarification  of  forward  guidance,  these 
measures  likely  will  strengthen  public  confidence  in  continuing  with  powerful  monetary 
easing, thereby contributing to further ensuring the achievement of the price stability target 
and leading to stability in financial markets. 
 Given  economic  developments  in  Japan,  where  prices  and  inflation  expectations  have  not 
risen easily, the Bank considers it necessary to maintain a positive output gap for as long as 
possible by keeping interest rates at sufficiently low levels for a prolonged time, in order to 
achieve  the  price  stability  target.  Some  measures  that  I  outlined  earlier  also  are  based  on 
such  thinking.  In  this  way,  central  banks  always  consider  the  most  appropriate  monetary 
policies  for  their  respective  situations,  with  a  view  to  achieving  their  objective  of  price 
stability. This does not only apply to Japan. For instance, the U.S. Federal Reserve has been 
proceeding  with  monetary  policy  normalization  for  the  past  few  years,  such  as  through 
incrementally  raising  its  policy  interest  rate.  After  the  turn  of  the  year,  however,  it 
temporarily stopped raising the policy interest rate due to such factors as the slowdown in 
the global economy, even though interest rate levels still have been quite low compared to 
the  time  before the  global  financial  crisis.  In  addition,  central  banks abroad, including  the 
Federal Reserve, recently have worked on reviewing their monetary policies after the global 
financial crisis and discussing new monetary policy frameworks as well as specific tools. In 
my understanding, the background to such moves is that (1) the real interest rate neutral to 
 9 
economic  activity,  or  the  natural  rate  of  interest,  has  been  on  a  declining  trend  in  many 
advanced  economies  in  recent  years,  mainly  reflecting  a  decrease  in  the  potential  growth 
rate  and  a  constant  excess  of  funds,  and  (2)  difficulties  in  enhancing  the  effectiveness  of 
monetary  policy  under  such  circumstances  have  been  taken  into  consideration.  Of  course, 
Japan and economies such as the United States cannot be treated in the same way. However, 
many central banks currently face a common fundamental challenge of how to  achieve the 
price  stability  target  while  securing  stability  in  economic  and  financial  conditions,  in  a 
situation  where  room  for  monetary  policy  responses  has  been  narrowing  compared  to  the 
past  due  to  low  growth  and  low  inflation.  While  continuously  keeping  this  challenge  in 
mind,  the  Bank  deems  it  necessary  to  follow  developments  in  discussions  abroad  as 
appropriate. 
 Conclusion 
So far, I have explained economic and price developments in Japan and the Bank's thinking 
behind the conduct of monetary policy based on such developments. I would like to close 
my speech today by adding a few words. 
 More  than two  weeks  have  passed  since  the  Heisei  era  drew to a close  and the  Reiwa era 
has started. While monetary policy is not classified in terms of the imperial era, I think that 
the  Heisei  era  can  be  characterized  by  a  continuous  battle  against  deflation  when  looking 
back  from  the  perspective  of  a  central  bank.  In  the  situation  of  a  prolonged  economic 
downturn  after  the  so-called  bubble  burst,  it  became  difficult  to  further  reduce  short-term 
interest  rates  in  order  to  stimulate  the  economy  after  around  1998  --  about  a  decade 
following  the  start  of  the  Heisei  era.  Incidents  such  as  the  global  financial  crisis  and  the 
Great  East  Japan  Earthquake  also  were  tough  challenges  for  Japan's  economy,  which  was 
seeking to move out of deflation. In order to overcome the zero lower bound on short-term 
interest  rates  amid  such  challenges,  the  Bank  has  worked  on  conducting  unconventional 
monetary  policies  ahead  of  many  other  economies,  such  as  introducing  forward  guidance 
and  purchasing  a  variety  of  assets.  Six  years  ago,  the  Bank  introduced  QQE,  which  is  a 
more powerful measure than before, and has persistently continued with powerful monetary 
easing.  Under  such  circumstances,  Japan's  economy  has  improved  significantly  over  the 
past  few  years  and  successfully  reached  the end  of  the  Heisei era in  a  situation  where the 
 10 
economy was no longer in deflation in the sense of a sustained decline in prices. 
 While  the  imperial  era  has  changed,  the  Bank's  mandate  of  aiming  at  achieving  price 
stability,  thereby  contributing  to  the  sound  development  of  the  national  economy,  has  not. 
Going  forward,  the  Bank  will  continue  to  make  its  utmost  efforts  as  the  central  bank  of 
Japan with a view to fulfilling this mandate while responding appropriately to the constantly 
changing developments in economic activity and prices. 
 Thank you very much for your attention.
