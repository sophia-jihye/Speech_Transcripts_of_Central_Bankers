Should the Bank of Japan Issue a Digital Currency? 
Speech at a Reuters Newsmaker Event in Tokyo 
 Masayoshi Amamiya 
Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
  I. Introduction 
It is a great honor and pleasure for me to be able to speak to you today. 
 In  recent  years,  the  environment  surrounding  Japan's  payment  and  settlement  systems  has 
gone  through  various  changes.  On  the  demand  side,  consumers  seek  more  convenient 
payment services, such as those available during the nighttime and on holidays or low-cost 
international  remittance  services.  Diversified  lifestyles  and  the  spread  of  e-commerce 
businesses have contributed to this. On the supply side, new devices -- such as smartphones 
and IC cards -- enabling the public to access payment services have continued to expand. In 
addition  to  traditional  financial  institutions,  non-bank  firms  with  strong  capabilities  in 
information  technologies,  or  so-called  FinTech  firms,  have  started  to  provide  cashless 
payments services. 
 As central banks have a responsibility to improve the safety and efficiency of payment and 
settlement systems, their future landscape in the digital age is an extremely important topic 
for  us.  In  fact,  whether  central  banks  should  issue  digital  currencies  as  a  payment 
instrument substituting for cash (banknotes and coins) has become an important issue. 
 Digital  currencies  issued  by  central  banks  are  called  "central  bank  digital  currencies" 
(CBDCs). The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) conducted an interesting survey on 
central bank initiatives for CBDC (Figure 1). Among the 63 respondent central banks, about 
70 percent are engaged in CBDC work, most of which is in the form of research/study or 
experiments/proof-of-concept.  Central  banks  that  have  actually  been  developing  CBDCs 
and are seriously considering its issuance are in the minority; they are limited only to those 
of countries, such as Sweden where the circulation of banknotes is rapidly  decreasing and 
emerging  and  developing  countries  where  the  infrastructure  supporting  banknotes  has  not 
yet fully developed. Except for these cases, many central banks see themselves as unlikely 
to issue CBDCs in the short or medium term.   
 Many central banks therefore take the position that they have no plan to issue CBDCs in the 
near future but will continue research into CBDCs, which is the position the Bank of Japan 
1 
 also takes. But why do central banks take this seemingly contradictory position? The main 
aim of this speech is to explain the background to this.   
 First  allow  me  to  outline  Japan's  current  status  regarding  retail  payments  --  that  is, 
developments  in  person-to-person  (P2P)  money  transfers  and  person-to-merchant  (P2M) 
payments -- and then talk about the possible forms of CBDC and its expected roles. I will 
then  discuss  the  implications  of  the  research  on  CBDC  for  the  future  payment  and 
settlement systems as a whole, including private digital currency.   
 II. Cash and Cashless Payments in Japan 
Let's  start  by  looking  at  survey  results  and  statistics  to  discover  current  trends  in  retail 
payments and the degree of progress toward a cashless society in Japan.   
 Payment Instruments for Individuals 
According to the results of a recent survey on individuals' payment instruments, the ratio of 
cash  payments  to  cashless  payments  in  private  consumption  expenditure  is  almost  one  to 
one (Figure 2). This figure displays the survey results of the share of payment instruments. 
In the survey, transfers between bank accounts are included as cashless payments. Thus, it 
should be noted that the ratio of cashless payments is at a higher level compared with that 
excluding  transfers  between  bank  accounts,  which  is  often  the  case  in  other  surveys. 
Looking at the share of payment instruments, the share of credit cards is high, at about 30 
percent,  and  that  of  prepaid  electronic  money  issued  by  firms  such  as  transport  and 
distribution firms is about 5 percent. The use of FinTech payment services, or "XYZ pay," 
that use mobile devices such as smartphones is still very limited, accounting for less than 1 
percent. 
 At what pace will the share of cashless payments increase? It is difficult to project the pace 
but  developments  in  the  amount  of  cash  in  circulation  are  useful  as  reference  information 
(Figure 3). The year-on-year rate of change in the amount of cash in circulation  for 1  yen 
and  5  yen  coins  for  2018  declined  very  moderately.  Meanwhile,  the  rate  for  the  100  yen 
coin was in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent, increasing at around the same rate as the nominal 
GDP  growth  rate  for  2018.  The  rates  for  the  500  yen  coin  and  1,000  yen  banknote  were 
2 
 over 2 percent. Those for 10,000 yen and 5,000 yen banknotes  were even higher, being in 
the range of 3 to 4 percent.   
 This  increase  in  the  amount  of  high  denomination  banknotes  in  circulation,  including 
10,000 yen banknotes, reflects the increasing demand for cash as a store of value -- that is, 
savings held in the form of cash under the mattress. The lower interest rate environment has 
lowered opportunity cost of holding cash. On the contrary, not many people hold 1,000 yen 
banknotes or 500 yen coins, or even 100 yen coins, under the mattress. I think the increase 
in circulation of these banknotes and coins indicates the possibility of their continued use as 
a means of payment rather than as a store of value. 
 Based  on  these  facts,  cashless  payments  seem  to  be  expanding  in  small-value  payments 
where the change piles up, but cash still continues to be widely used as a means of payment. 
The  year  2018  saw  a  growing  social  interest  in  cashless  payments;  however,  despite  the 
general  impression  gained  from  the  media,  the  pace  of  transition  from  cash  to  cashless 
payments  seems  to  have  been  moderate.  The  news  that  there  were  long  queues  at  bank 
ATMs  before  the  10-day  holiday  from  late  April  to  early  May  2019  indicates  that  cash  is 
still an important payment instrument for many consumers. 
 Moderate Transition to Cashless Payments 
Why the moderate transition to cashless payments in Japan? It is considered that the causes 
lie in both the demand and supply of cash payments.   
 The demand for cash payments is thought to be related to people's perception of cash: less 
concern  about  wasting  money  than  when  using  cashless  payment  instruments;  a  safe 
environment where cash is rarely stolen and is even often returned when people lose their 
pocketbooks or purses; and public confidence in the high anti-counterfeit security levels of 
Japanese  banknotes,  resulting  in  counterfeit  banknotes  having  a  very  low  circulation.  The 
prolonged low interest rate environment may also have pushed up the demand for cash.   
 As  for  the  supply  of  cash  payments,  cash  payment  networks  supported  by  financial 
institutions' bricks and mortar branches and ATMs are important (Figure 4). The denser the 
3 
 networks, the more convenient cash withdrawal from the bank account and cash deposit to 
the account. For this reason, the greater the number of branches of financial institutions per 
habitable  area,  the  higher  the  ratio  of  cash  in  circulation  to  nominal  GDP  tends  to  be. 
Japan's  high  ratio  of  cash  in  circulation  to  nominal  GDP  is  considered  to  be  due  to  the 
established  convenient  and  inexpensive  cash  supply  chain,  as  exemplified  in  the 
concentration of financial institutions' branches and ATMs within a small national territory.   
 These structural factors in the demand and supply of cash payments are considered to have 
slowed  down  the  transition  to  the  cashless  payments.  Nonetheless,  if  the  number  of  new 
cashless payments users and  merchants increases up to a certain scale, the use of cashless 
payments  could  then  expand  sharply.  Let's  take  a  look  at  the  case  of  South  Korea.  In  the 
wake  of  the  Asian  currency  crisis  in  the  late  1990s,  South  Korea's  government  promoted 
cashless  payments  as  a  part  of  economic  policy  package.  It  introduced  a  system  of  a 
deduction  of  20  percent  of  annual  credit  card  payments  from  taxable  income,  and  obliged 
merchants  to  accept  credit  cards.  These  measures  turned  the  tide,  and  the  move  toward  a 
cashless society accelerated.   
 In  Japan  as  well,  the  government  plans  to  introduce  loyalty  rewards  for  using  cashless 
payment  instruments  with  the  scheduled  consumption  tax  hike  in  October  2019.  These 
measures may provide a boost toward the cashless society in Japan.   
 III. Central Bank Digital Currency and Private Digital Currency 
The phenomenon of the demand for cash being surprisingly persistent and the ratio of cash 
in circulation to nominal GDP continuing to increase has been observed not only in Japan 
but  in  many  countries.1  Nonetheless,  cashless  payments  will  likely  increase  in  numerous 
countries in the long run. Against this background, there has been a growing interest in the 
digitization of currencies issued by central banks, or central bank money.

 1. Issuance Forms of Central Bank Digital Currency 
There are two main variants of CBDC. One variant is electronic central bank money, which 
offers  access  to  a  limited group  of  users  such  as  banks,  among  whom  it  is  used  for  funds 
settlement.  This  variant,  called  "wholesale  CBDC,"  adopts  new  information  technologies 
such as distributed ledger technology (DLT)  in settlements using central bank deposits, or 
central  bank  liabilities  which  have  been  digitized.  The  other  variant  is  electronic  central 
bank money which is assumed to be widely accessible, including for individuals and firms. 
This variant is called "general purpose CBDC." From now on, I will use the term CBDC to 
refer to the general purpose variant. 
 A  general  purpose  CBDC  is  a  substitute  for  cash  (banknotes  and  coins),  and  two  issuing 
forms are possible (Figure 5). One is an "account-based" CBDC, in which individuals and 
firms open an account at a central bank and use it to make transfers between accounts. This 
scheme is fundamentally the same as transfers between accounts held at private banks. The 
difference lies in whether the accounts are held at the central bank or at private banks. The 
other form is a "token-based" CBDC, also referred to as a "value-based" CBDC, in which 
users deposit CBDC to their smartphone applications or IC cards and transfer value to other 
users when making payments. This scheme is similar to prepaid electronic money issued by 
transport and distribution firms and FinTech firms. The difference is whether the issuer is a 
private firm or the central bank. 
 2. Expected Roles for Central Bank Digital Currency 
CBDCs  are  expected  to  play  various  roles  (Figure  6).  For  instance,  in  terms  of  monetary 
policy,  academia,  in  principle,  argues  that  CBDCs  should  bear  interest  --  even  negative 
interest  rates  in  some  cases  --  as  that  could  increase  the  effectiveness  of  monetary  policy. 
This argument is based on the premise that the level of interest rates applied to CBDC could 
work  as  the  effective  lower  bound  of  interest  rates  for  wide-ranging  financial  assets. 
However, in order to overcome the zero lower bound of nominal interest rates, cash needs 
to be completely eliminated. This is because even if a central bank applies negative interest 
rates to CBDC, as long as cash which yields zero interest remains, there will be a shift of 
funds  toward  cash.  Abolishing  cash,  used  by  many  people,  would  only  make  payment 
infrastructures less convenient. There is no central bank that wishes to do this.

 Resolving the Crowding of Cashless Payment Instruments 
We often hear the opinion that the rationale for issuing CBDC is to resolve the crowding of 
cashless  payment  instruments  and  to  unify  all  payment  instruments.  Because  of  the  large 
number of cashless payment instruments currently available, consumers are often at a loss 
as  to  which  one  to  use.  In  this  regard,  Professor  Sheena  Iyengar  of  Columbia  University 
conducted  an  interesting  experiment  on  the  provision  of  choice.  She  carried  out  a  social 
experiment  where  consumers  shopping  at  a  grocery  store  encountered  a  tasting  booth  for 
jam  that  offered  either  6  or  24  different  flavors.  The  results  showed  that  more  consumers 
stopped at the tasting booth displaying 24 flavors, but when it came to purchasing behavior, 
consumers  who  were exposed  to  6  flavors  were  more  likely  to  purchase  the  product.  This 
implies that extensive options can attract people's interest, yet when they  are too extensive 
they tend to reduce people's motivation to make a choice. Many might perhaps feel that this 
notion is reflected in current developments in cashless payments in Japan.   
 If central banks issue CBDCs and many consumers begin to use them, there is certainly the 
possibility  that  this  would  lead  to  a  resolution  of  the  crowding  of  cashless  payment 
instruments.  In  fact,  looking  back  at  the  history  of  currency  globally,  the  issuance  of 
banknotes has become limited to central banks as the issue of banknotes by multiple private 
banks in the past led to their uncontrollable increase, causing economic turmoil.   
 That said, it is not appropriate to identify the current retail payments market with the past 
where the uncontrollable increase in the issue of banknotes by multiple institutions caused 
turmoil.  The  retail  payments  market  is  now  in  a  phase  where  FinTech  firms  and  financial 
institutions  are  competing  with  each  other  in  payments  innovation.  The  Bank  of  Japan 
judges  that  it  is  important  for  now  to  promote  innovation  in  the  private  sector,  as  it  has 
strong  information  technology  capabilities.  If  the  current  crowding  of  cashless  payment 
instruments is maintained forever, it would reduce consumers' economic welfare, but such a 
situation will likely be resolved eventually in the process of competition.   
 Maintaining the Competitive Environment in the Retail Payments Market 
On  the  other  hand,  leaving  the  competition  up  to  the  market  may  not  lead  to  desirable 
outcomes  in  the  long  term;  it  could  possibly  result  in  "market  failure."  The  payment  and 
6 
 settlement  systems  have  "network  externalities"  where  the  wider  a  network  is,  the  more 
benefit the participants in the network can enjoy. For this reason, if the number of users and 
merchants  in  the  network  exceeds  a  certain  scale  --  "a  critical  mass"  --  the  scale  of  the 
payment platform would expand greatly, leading to an oligopoly or monopoly in the retail 
payments market. If specific businesses gain strong control over the retail payments market, 
it  could  distort  the  pricing  mechanism,  decrease  incentives  for  innovation,  or  increase 
systemic risk when problems arise.   
 At  present,  the Japanese  retail  payments  market  is  not  facing  any  oligopoly  or  monopoly. 
However,  a  decline  in  competition  in  the  retail  payments  market  is  now  an  issue  in  some 
countries like Sweden, where cash circulation is rapidly declining and society is becoming 
increasingly  cashless.  Some  argue  that  the  issuance  of  CBDC  would  contribute  to 
maintaining the competitive environment in the retail payments market.2  It is believed that 
if  a  central  bank  builds  cashless  payment  platforms,  this  would  maintain  the  pressure  on 
private sector firms to compete with each other. However, my take is that issuing CBDC is 
not the best option to promote competition in the retail payments market. The first possible 
prescription should be a government policy on competition, such as splitting up monopoly 
firms  and  strengthening  regulations  to  resolve  distortions  in  competition.  Therefore,  I 
believe it is not really appropriate to issue CBDC for the purpose of promoting competition 
in the retail payments market.   
 Fundamental Functions of Currency and a Two-Tiered System 
To explore the rationale for issuing CBDC, we can simply get back to the fundamental roles 
of currency. Payment instruments that are safe, reliable, inexpensive, and available to all are 
essential  to  support  economic  activities.  I  think  most  people  would  agree  that  the  central 
bank should continue to be responsible for supplying these instruments in the digital age as 
well. The rationale for issuing CBDC may basically rest on this. 
 CBDC  functions  not  only  as  a  means  of  payment  but  also  as  a  store  of  value.  In  normal 
times, people may not be aware of the difference between central bank money and private

 money  (i.e., money  issued  by  the  private  sector); however,  this  is  not the  case  in  times  of 
financial crisis or natural disaster. When people are anxious, the precautionary demand for 
central  bank  money  free  of  credit  risk  tends  to  increase.  When  the  Great  East  Japan 
Earthquake hit Japan, there was a significant increase in cash withdrawal in disaster areas.3 
Also, when the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy led to a financial crisis in Iceland, demand for 
cash  soared  so  high  that  the  Central  Bank  of  Iceland's  inventory  of  banknotes  was  nearly 
exhausted.4  These  facts  show  that  it  is  reasonable  to  say  that  a  framework  should  be  in 
place to supply highly credible central bank money that is suitable for the digital age.   
 Nevertheless, issuing CBDC in normal times with the purpose of preparing for crisis could 
pose a new challenge. For example, if CBDC starts to substitute for bank deposits, it could 
squeeze banks' credit intermediation and affect the real economy. There is also the view that 
CBDC, which functions as a safe haven in times of stress, would rather amplify the stress. 
Since all it takes is a few clicks on a computer or smartphone, a shift from bank deposits to 
CBDC would occur in a much more drastic way in the digital age than with traditional bank 
runs, and thus could exacerbate a financial crisis. This is called a "digital bank run." 
 As we look deeper into these issues, we end up facing the issue of how we should treat the 
"two-tiered  system,"  established  in  most  modern  states.  Under  the  two-tiered  system,  a 
central bank exclusively supplies the public with central bank money consisting of cash and 
central bank deposits,  and private banks provide deposits through credit creation based on 
the  central  bank  money.  The  two-tiered  system  has  various  advantages  regarding 
information processing and resource allocation. While the credibility of currency is ensured 
by  central  bank  money,  financial  resources  are  efficiently  allocated  through  private-led 
initiatives.  Private  sector  innovations  are  greatly  utilized  in  the  area  of  payment  services. 
For  example,  new  cashless  payment  instruments  offered  by  FinTech  firms  provide  better 
user interface using smartphones and make payment using deposits very handy.

  No  matter  how  safe  and  reliable  CBDC  is  as  a  payment  instrument,  the  benefits  derived 
from the two-tiered system would be lost if private money were to be replaced by CBDC on 
a considerable scale. When considering the design of payment and settlement systems, it is 
necessary to examine ways to improve the overall functions and credibility of the systems. 
In doing so, central bank money and private money should not be considered independently. 
We  need  to  take  into  account  the interrelations  between the  two.  Next,  I  will  discuss  how 
the  functions  of  private  digital  currencies  can  be  improved  to  achieve  a  level  close  to  the 
expected  functions  of  CBDC  in  terms  of  creditworthiness,  general  acceptability,  and 
settlement finality (Figure 7).   
 3. Improving the Functions of Private Digital Currency 
Creditworthiness of Private Digital Currency 
As I have mentioned earlier, in the digital age, it is important to prepare ourselves for crises 
with  safe  assets,  and  CBDC  is  an  important  possibility.  However,  it  is  also  important  to 
design a framework that improves the creditworthiness of private money, regardless of the 
issuance  of  CBDC.  If  the  credit  risk  of  private  money  could  be  minimized  and  the  credit 
gap between private money and central bank money could be narrowed, the issue of a shift 
from bank deposits to CBDC could, in theory, be alleviated.   
 In Japan, among the various types of private money, a framework of protection provided by 
deposit insurance for bank deposits was put firmly in place after the crisis of the late 1990s. 
As  for  electronic  money  issued  by  transport  and  distribution  firms  and  FinTech  firms, 
consumer  protection  is  provided  by  securing  assets.  For  example,  firms  issuing  electronic 
money  which  is  convertible  to  cash  are  required  by  law  to  secure  funds  equivalent  to  or 
more than the amount received from users, by making a security deposit or by other means.   
 As for developments overseas, in China, BigTech firms, including Alipay and WeChat Pay, 
that  provide  payment  services  are  required  to  deposit  funds  equivalent  to  the  amount 
received from their users in accounts at the People's Bank of China. This could be seen as 
an example of a scheme where BigTech firms issue private digital currencies based on the 
credibility of a central bank. In terms of functionality, it is very much the same as narrow 
9 
 banking, where the central bank requires full reserves, and is almost equivalent to CBDC in 
terms of creditworthiness. 
 To  ensure  the  stability  of  the  retail  payment  system  as  a  whole,  it  is  essential  to  design  a 
framework that secures the creditworthiness of private digital currencies. The social impact 
would increase as the scale of the cashless payment platforms operated by the private sector 
grows.  With  regard  to  payment  instruments  and  services,  the  authorities  would  therefore 
need  to  put  an  adequate  risk-based  regulatory  framework  in  place.  As  for  firms  operating 
payment platforms, they would be required to take responsible action, including adoption of 
sophisticated  risk  management  procedures  and  stringent  responses 
to  regulatory 
requirements.   
 General Acceptability of Money 
Even  if  the  creditworthiness  of  private  digital  currencies  improves,  it  does  not  mean  that 
they  will  be  widely  accepted  as  money.  For  instance,  merchants  participating  in  different 
payment  platforms  operated  by  FinTech  firms  do  not  necessarily  overlap. This  means  that 
electronic  money  issued  by  a  FinTech  firm  cannot  be  used  in  transactions  with  merchants 
participating  in  payment  platforms  operated  by  different  FinTech  firms.  Moreover,  users 
cannot  conduct  P2P  money  transfers  across  different  payment  platforms.  Thus,  electronic 
money  issued  by  FinTech  firms  is  at  present  considerably  inferior  to  cash  in  terms  of 
general acceptability.             
 Overseas,  there  are  cases  where  interoperability  among  payment  service  providers  is 
ensured. For example, in Hong Kong, major banks and nonbank payment service providers 
(store  value  facilities)  such  as  Alipay  and  WeChat  Pay  have  joined  the  Faster  Payment 
System -- a real-time funds transfer system which operates on a 24/7 basis  -- launched by 
the  Hong  Kong  Monetary  Authority  in  2018.  This  has  enabled  users  of  these  service 
providers to conduct P2P money transfers. Users can even transfer funds to bank accounts 
using  electronic  money  issued  by  these  nonbank  payment  service  providers.  To  the extent 
that interoperability is ensured, the general acceptability of electronic money issued by the 
private sector will likely increase.     
 10 
 With  regard  to  interoperability  among  private  digital  currencies,  whether  a  central  bank 
should  allow  new  nonbank  payment  service  providers,  such  as  FinTech  firms,  to  open 
current accounts at the central bank may be an issue for discussion. If the interoperability of 
private money is enhanced through safe and efficient settlement using  central bank current 
accounts, private digital currencies could resemble CBDC in terms of general acceptability. 
However, central banks need to examine the notion of allowing nonbanks to access current 
accounts comprehensively from various aspects, including the potential impact on financial 
systems  in  addition  to  interoperability.  Needless  to  say,  nonbanks  seeking  access  to 
payment  and  settlement  systems  via  central  bank  current  accounts  would  be  required  to 
meet strict standards in many areas, such as financial soundness, information security, and 
risk  management.  Overseas,  nonbank  payment  service  providers  are  now  allowed  to  open 
current  accounts  at  central  banks  in  countries  such  as  the  United  Kingdom  and  Australia. 
This is also currently under consideration in Switzerland and Singapore. 
 Settlement Finality 
Now,  I  would  like  to  touch  upon  the  issue  of  "settlement  finality."  Finality  means  that 
settlement of an obligation is irrevocable. Central bank money  is not only credit risk  free, 
but also provides immediate finality. Banknotes can be used to settle obligations 24 hours a 
day, 365 days a year with finality.   
 In Japan, the launch of the Zengin More Time System in October 2018 has enabled users to 
send funds on a real-time basis 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for transfers of less than 100 
million yen per transaction (hereinafter referred to as "retail transfers"). It should be noted, 
however,  that  transactions  between  financial  institutions,  accompanying  these  retail 
transfers between users, are settled on a deferred net settlement (DNS) basis. Under a DNS 
system,  payment  instructions  received  from  financial  institutions  are  pooled  until  a 
designated time, and then the gross values of incoming and outgoing funds are netted out. 
Only the net amount is settled. While  the efficient use of liquidity provided by DNS is an 
advantage,  it  accumulates  unsettled  positions  up  to  the  designated  time,  which  means  that 
settlement is not final until this net position is settled. In this way, DNS harbors a systemic 
risk;  if  even  one  of  the  participating  financial  institutions  fails  to  meet  its  obligations,  it 
could potentially start a chain reaction affecting all other institutions.   
11 
  If the number of retail transfers via deposit accounts at financial institutions increases with 
the  progress  toward  a  cashless  society,  it  could  bring  an  increase  in  intraday  unsettled 
positions,  thereby  accumulating  risks  in  payment  and  settlement  systems  as  a  whole.  To 
address this concern, one option is to reduce dependence on settlement via deposit accounts 
at  financial  institutions  by  issuing  a  CBDC  which  provides  immediate  settlement  finality. 
However,  there  are  also  other  options;  settlement  methods  of  retail  transfers  between 
financial  institutions  could  be  changed  from  DNS  to  real-time  gross  settlements  (RTGS). 
RTGS  offers  a  simple  way  of  settling  funds  where  the  central  bank  immediately  executes 
payment instructions received from  financial institutions. Under an RTGS system, as each 
payment is settled with finality in real time  one after another, systemic risk can, to a large 
extent,  be  contained.  To  settle  RTGS  transactions  24  hours  a  day,  365  days  a  year,  the 
central bank's system also needs to operate throughout the day.   
 Meanwhile, new RTGS platforms, which enable retail transfers 24 hours a day, 365 days a 
year,  have  already  been  launched in  places  such  as  Australia,  Hong  Kong,  and  Europe.  In 
these platforms, settlement finality is ensured, as with CBDC. I think that it is important for 
each  jurisdiction  to  consider  the  most  desirable  way  to  settle  retail  transfers  through 
cost-benefit analysis, while taking into account developments in payments and settlements 
in each country.         
 IV. Concluding Remarks 
Today, I have had the pleasure of sharing with you my understanding on retail payments in 
the digital age, focusing on the relationship between central bank money and private money. 
 Now,  I  would  like  to  give  you  my  own  answer  to  the  question  I  posed  at  the  beginning: 
"Why are many central banks, including the Bank of Japan, committed to researching and 
studying  into  CBDCs  even  though  they  have  no  plan  to  issue  them  in  the  near  future?"  I 
have two reasons. First, since technological innovation evolves rapidly, the retail payments 
market structure could suddenly change dramatically, pushing us toward a cashless society. 
In some cases, the need for CBDC issuance may suddenly increase. To be able to  adapt to 
such  a  situation,  central  banks  need  to  deepen  their  understanding  on  the  latest 
12 
 developments  in  information  technologies  and  their  applicability  to  CBDC.  Second,  as  I 
have discussed in the latter half of my speech, through research into CBDC -- or through the 
CBDC  lens  --  central  banks  examine  more  fundamental  questions  such  as:  "What  are  the 
required  functions  of  money?"; "What  ways  do  we  have  of  improving  the complementary 
relationship between central bank money and private money?"; or "What ways  do we have 
of enhancing the functionality of private digital currency?" This process can offer clues for 
ways in which payment and settlement systems as a whole can be improved. 
 The Bank will continue to examine CBDC with these two aspects in mind. In this respect, 
allow me to introduce two of our recent initiatives. On the technological front, the Bank is 
continuing  research  into  distributed  ledger  technology  --  DLT.  Project  Stella,  a  joint 
research  project  with  the  European  Central  Bank  is  part  of  these  initiatives.5  This  project 
has  resulted  in  three  reports  so  far,  exploring,  for  example,  the  applicability  of  DLT  to 
payments using central bank deposits -- that is, wholesale CBDC. 
 On the legal front, the Bank's Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies set up a study 
group on legal issues regarding CBDC in November 2018. It identifies potential legal issues 
that  would  arise  if  the  Bank  were  to  issue  CBDC  in  response  to  rapid  developments  in 
technology and their possible interpretations. The report will be released in due course.   
 The  Bank  will  continue  to  work  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  safety  of  payment  and 
settlement systems. It will examine, from various perspectives, the desirable nature of these 
systems, including the issue of CBDC. And this brings me to the end of my speech. 
 Thank you very much for your attention.

Figure 6
Expected Roles for CBDC 
 Effectiveness on monetary policy
 The level of interest rates applied to CBDC could work as the effective lower bound of
interest rates for wide-ranging financial assets?
 Resolving the crowding of cashless payment instruments
 Will issuing CBDC promote the unification of all cashless payment instruments?
 The crowding of cashless payment instruments will likely be resolved in the process of
competition.
 Maintaining the competitive environment in the retail payments market
 Will issuing CBDC maintain the pressure on private sector firms to compete with each
other?
 The role of a government policy on competition.
 Fundamental functions of currency and a two-tiered system
 Central banks should continue to supply payment instruments that are safe, reliable,
inexpensive, and available to all in the digital age as well.
 Under the two-tiered system, overall functions of payment and settlement systems
should be examined, while taking into account the interrelations between central bank
money and private money.

Figure 7
Improving the Functions of Private Digital Currency
 Creditworthiness of private digital currency
 It is important to minimize the credit risk of private digital currencies and narrow the
credit gap between private money and central bank money for the stability of financial
system and payment and settlement systems.
General acceptability of money
 Ensuring interoperability among payment service providers can increase the general
acceptability of private digital currencies.
 Overseas,
there are cases where nonbank payment service providers and banks
participate in the same payment and settlement platforms.
 Settlement finality
 Settlement finality is ensured in RTGS platforms that enable retail transfers on a 24/7
basis as with CBDC.
 Overseas, such RTGS platforms have already been launched in some places.
