Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy 
Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Kagoshima 
Masayoshi Amamiya 
Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
  Introduction 
It  is  my  pleasure  to  have  the  opportunity  today  to  exchange  views  with  administrative, 
financial,  and  business  leaders  in  Kagoshima  Prefecture.  I  would  like  to  take  this 
opportunity  to  express  my  sincere  gratitude  for  your  cooperation  with the activities  of  the 
Bank of Japan's Kagoshima Branch. 
 At the outset, I would like to offer my heartfelt sympathies to those who are suffering from 
the heavy rain since end-June. I understand that the disastrous damage is still evident in the 
region and sincerely hope for a swift and full recovery. 
 At  the  Monetary  Policy  Meeting  (MPM)  held  two  days  ago,  the  Bank  updated  its 
projections for Japan's economic activity and prices through fiscal 2021 and released them 
in  its  quarterly  report,  the  July  2019  Outlook  for  Economic  Activity  and  Prices  (Outlook 
Report).  Today,  I  would  like  to  explain  the  Bank's  view  on  developments  in  economic 
activity and prices as well as the recent conduct of monetary policy, while outlining the July 
Outlook Report. 
 I. Financial and Economic Developments 
Since this  May,  when  the  Reiwa  era  started,  protectionist  moves  including  the  U.S.-China 
trade  friction  have  intensified,  and  uncertainties  over  the  outlook  for  the  global  economy 
have  heightened.  In  this  situation,  financial  markets  in  each  economy  have  continued  to 
show large fluctuations. Let me first talk about the current situation for overseas economies. 
 Although  overseas  economies  have  been  growing  moderately  on  the  whole,  slowdowns 
have continued to be observed (Chart 1). The pace of increase in the world trade volume has 
been decelerating, mainly due to the U.S.-China trade friction and a slowdown in IT-related 
goods, and the diffusion indexes (DIs) for the business sentiment of manufacturing firms on 
a  global  basis  fell  below  50  in  May,  which  is  the  borderline  between  improvement  and 
deterioration of business conditions perceived by firms. Looking at developments in major 
regions, the U.S. economy has continued to  expand moderately, supported primarily by an 
increase  in  private  consumption.  On  the  other  hand,  China's  GDP  growth  rate  for  the 
April-June quarter of 2019 registered the record low figure of 6.2 percent since 1992, from 
 1 
when  the  data  are  available,  mainly  against  the  background  of  weakness  in  the 
manufacturing  sector.  The  growth  pace  of  the  European  economy,  in  particular  Germany, 
also  has  been  decelerating.  Meanwhile,  in  global  financial  markets,  stock  prices  in  many 
economies declined through early June due to uncertainties over the global economy. 
 Under these circumstances, major central banks have been shifting their policy stance from 
monetary  tightening  through  end-2018,  such  as  raising  policy  rates,  to  monetary  easing. 
Last  week,  the  European  Central  Bank  (ECB)  revised  its  forward  guidance,  which  is  its 
thinking about the future course of its policy rates, to a more accommodative one. The ECB 
also  announced that  it  would  start to  consider additional easing  measures.  In  addition,  the 
Federal Reserve reduced its policy rate by 0.25 percent yesterday for the first time in about 
10 and a half  years. However, as I mentioned, the U.S. economy has continued to expand 
moderately.  Federal  Reserve  Chair  Powell  explained  that  the policy  rate  cut this  time  was 
intended  to  insure  against  downside  risks  from  weak  global  growth  and  trade  policy 
uncertainty. 
 Although Japan's economy, mainly the export sector, has been affected by the slowdown in 
the global economy, domestic demand such as business fixed investment has remained firm. 
Thus,  the  Bank  judges  that  the  economy  has  been  on  a  moderate  expanding  trend,  with  a 
virtuous  cycle  from  income  to  spending  operating.  This  also  can  be  confirmed  by  an 
indicator called the output gap, which represents the balance between demand and supply in 
the economy as a whole (Chart 2). A positive output gap shows excess demand, whereas a 
negative  output  gap  indicates  excess  supply.  The  gap  became  positive  around  2017  and 
thereafter  widened  within  positive  territory  on  the  back  of  the  economic expansion.  It  has 
remained substantially positive recently. 
 Let me elaborate more on this by demand component (Chart 3). Exports have shown some 
weakness,  reflecting  a  decline  mainly  in  those  of  capital  goods  and  IT-related  goods  for 
China,  as  well  as  the  NIEs  and  the  ASEAN  economies,  due  to  the  slowdown  in  overseas 
economies.  Looking  at  the  business  conditions  DI  in  the  June  2019  Tankan  (Short-Term 
Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan), the manufacturing sector -- which is susceptible 
to  developments  in  overseas  economies  --  has  declined  somewhat  significantly  for  two 
 2 
consecutive quarters. 
 On  the  other  hand,  domestic  demand  has  remained  firm,  as  evidenced  by  the  business 
conditions DI for the nonmanufacturing sector staying at a favorable level. With corporate 
profits staying at high levels on the whole, business fixed investment has continued on an 
increasing trend (Chart 4). For each Tankan survey, the business fixed investment plans tend 
to  show  certain  revision  patterns.  Looking  at  the  June  Tankan,  the  plans  for  fiscal  2019 
indicate that business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing firmly, exceeding 
the  past  averages  in  the  June  surveys.  Business  fixed  investment  seems  to  have  been 
supported  by  investment  in  a  wide  range  of  areas,  such  as  that  (1)  intended  for  domestic 
capacity expansion, (2) aiming at saving labor in order to deal with labor shortage, and (3) 
in  research  and  development  for  growth  areas.  Investment  has  been  robust  in  the 
nonmanufacturing  sector  as  well;  for  example,  there  has  been  a  rise  in  construction  of 
distribution  facilities,  reflecting  an  expansion  in  e-commerce,  and  of  accommodation 
facilities targeted for inbound demand. Private consumption has increased moderately, with 
the  employment  and  income  situation  continuing  to  improve  steadily.  It  is  said  that  an 
increase  in  demand  prior  to  the  scheduled  consumption  tax  hike  has  been  seen  in  part, 
including  sales  of  automobiles  and  household  electrical  appliances,  but  it  seems  only 
marginal  compared  with  that  of  the  previous  hike.  Looking  at  consumption-related 
indicators, inbound demand from foreign visitors has increased significantly for the past six 
years, by about four times. Foreign visitors to Kagoshima Prefecture also have surged since 
some additional international flights started operations at Kagoshima Airport. As there are a 
plenty of attractive areas in Japan, including this prefecture,  there likely has been a steady 
rise in foreign visitors to a wider range of areas. 
 With  regard  to  the  outlook,  as  described  in  the  Bank's  July  2019  Outlook  Report,  Japan's 
economy is likely to continue on an expanding trend throughout the projection period -- that 
is, through fiscal 2021 -- despite being affected by the slowdown in overseas economies for 
the  time  being  (Chart  5).  Specifically,  the  real  GDP  growth  rates  are  projected  to  be  0.7 
percent  for  fiscal  2019,  0.9  percent  for  fiscal  2020,  and  1.1  percent  for  fiscal  2021.  The 
Bank estimates that the economic growth rate that can be achieved in the long term, or the 
so-called  potential  growth  rate,  is  nearly  1  percent.  Thus,  Japan's  economy  is  expected  to 
 3 
continue growing at a pace consistent with its potential. 
 There  are  two  important  points  in  making  an  assessment  of  this  outlook.  The  first  is  how 
overseas economies will pick up. The second point is the sustainability of domestic demand 
in  the  meantime.  In  what  follows,  I  would  like  to  explain  these  points,  starting  with  the 
sustainability of domestic demand. 
 With regard to private consumption, it is likely to continue on a moderate increasing trend 
as the employment and income situation continues to improve. Although the effects of the 
scheduled consumption tax hike warrant attention, they are projected to be smaller this time 
compared  to  those  of  the  previous  hike  in  2014,  partly  due  to  a  smaller  burden  for 
households from the tax hike and various measures introduced by the government to smooth 
out demand prior to and after the hike. In addition, public investment is likely to increase, 
mainly led by that in infrastructure due to  policy measures for national resilience, and this 
will  contribute  to  underpinning  economic  activity.  Moreover,  business  fixed  investment  is 
the  key  to  sustainability  of  domestic  demand.  As  I  explained,  it  is  expected  to  continue 
increasing firmly in fiscal 2019. This is mainly supported by high levels of corporate profits, 
accommodative financial conditions, and steady demand for medium- to long-term strategic 
investment and for investment by the nonmanufacturing sector, both of which are relatively 
unsusceptible  to  changes  in  overseas  demand  and  the  business  cycle.  Going  forward, 
business  fixed  investment  is  expected  to  increase  moderately.  Thus,  the  Bank  recognizes 
that  Japan's  economy  has  become  more  resilient.  However,  there  is  a  possibility  that 
business  and  household  sentiment  will  be  affected  depending  on  future  developments  in 
overseas economies and the markets. It is necessary to pay attention to the possibility that 
firms'  investment  stance  will  become  cautious  mainly  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  if 
uncertainties  concerning  overseas  economies  in  particular  heighten  further  going  forward. 
This leads to the next point of developments in overseas economies. 
 Overseas  economies  are  expected  to  grow  moderately  on  the  whole;  although  slowdowns 
are likely to continue for the time being, these economies are projected to pick up thereafter 
on  the  back  of  the  effects  of  stimulus  measures  in  China  and  the  progress  in  global 
adjustments in  IT-related goods,  underpinned by  accommodative  financial  conditions. The 
 4 
baseline  scenario  that  overseas  economies  will  pick  up  is  basically  unchanged.  A  similar 
outlook  is  presented  in  the  World  Economic  Outlook  (WEO)  Update  released  by  the 
International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  in  July  (Chart  6).  According  to  its  outlook,  global 
growth is projected to decelerate to 3.2 percent in 2019 but pick up to 3.5 percent -- about 
the  same  level  as  the  past  average  --  in  2020.  By  region,  it  is  projected  that  the  U.S. 
economy  will  continue  to  expand  moderately  and  that  the  Chinese  economy  will  broadly 
follow  a  stable  growth  path  with  authorities  conducting  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  in  a 
timely manner,  despite being affected to some extent by the trade friction  with the United 
States and deleveraging policy measures. In addition, the European economy is projected to 
gradually  move  out  of  its  deceleration  phase,  reflecting  progress  in  adjustments  in  the 
manufacturing sector, where relatively weak developments have been observed. That said, 
the  downside  risks  concerning  overseas  economies  have  remained  significant,  and 
uncertainties  regarding  the  effects  of  protectionist  moves  in  particular  have  been 
heightening. Although the United States and China are still in negotiations to solve the trade 
issues, future developments in U.S. trade policy against China, as well as other economies, 
continue to warrant attention. Besides this trade friction, uncertainties concerning overseas 
economies  include  (1)  the  timing  of  when  the  effects  of  stimulus  measures  in  China  will 
materialize,  (2)  how  far  the  adjustments  in  IT-related  goods  will  progress,  and  (3)  the 
consequences of negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU). 
It  is  necessary  to  pay  attention  to  the  risk  that,  if  uncertainties  concerning  overseas 
economies heighten further going forward, domestic and foreign economies will be affected 
widely, not only through downward pressure on the trade activity of related economies but 
also deterioration in business sentiment and instability in financial markets. Thus, the Bank 
will  carefully  monitor  whether  overseas  economies  will  pick  up  during  the  time  when 
domestic demand, as I referred to earlier, is maintained firmly. 
 II. Price Developments 
Next, I will explain price developments in Japan (Chart 7). For many years starting from the 
late  1990s,  Japan's  economy  was  in  deflation  in  terms  of  a  sustained  decline  in  the 
consumer  price  index  (CPI).  In  order  to  make  a  breakthrough  in  this  situation,  the  Bank 
introduced quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) in April 2013, embarking on 
unprecedentedly  powerful  monetary  easing.  Since  then,  Japan's  economy  has  improved 
 5 
significantly and the positive annual CPI inflation has taken hold. Thus, the economy is no 
longer in deflation, in the sense of a sustained decline in prices. 
 Turning  to  recent  price  developments,  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI  is  at 
around  0.5  percent  and  has  continued  to  show  relatively  weak  developments  compared  to 
the  economic  expansion  and  tight  labor  market  conditions.  However,  with  the  economy 
continuing  on  an  expanding  trend,  the  basic  mechanism  for  moderate  increases  in  wages 
and  prices  driven  by  a  positive  output  gap  has  continued  to  operate.  At  this  year's  annual 
spring  labor-management  wage  negotiations,  base  pay  increases  were  achieved  for  a  sixth 
consecutive year. The rate of increase as a whole was at about the same level as last year; in 
particular, that for small and medium-sized firms, which are susceptible to labor shortage, 
turned out to be relatively high. 
 In addition to wages, other costs, such as distribution costs, have continued to increase. In 
this situation, firms have passed on cost increases to sales prices and such moves gradually 
have been spreading of late. Thus, prices seem to have become more stable recently. Let me 
introduce  two  examples  (Chart  8).  The  first  is  price  rises  such  as  in  food  products,  daily 
necessities,  and  services.  Looking  at  prices  of  food  products  and  daily  necessities  sold  at 
supermarkets,  the  rates of  increase  have  been accelerating  clearly  since  April.  In  addition, 
the positive annual inflation in prices of dining-out and housework-related services among 
general services has taken hold. The second example is that firms' stance has shifted toward 
further  raising  prices,  regardless  of  the  firm  size.  Looking  at  the  output  prices  DI  of 
industries related to consumption, which has close relations with the CPI, since around 2017, 
the  proportion  of  enterprises  answering  that  the  output  prices  have  risen  has  exceeded the 
proportion  of  those  answering  that  such  prices  have  fallen,  and  the  gap  has  expanded 
gradually. 
 Of course, a rise in overall prices is not favorable for households if focusing only on the rise. 
What is important is that it should accompany improvement in the employment and income 
situation  so  that  households  can  accept  price  rises  (Chart  9).  On  this  point,  employee 
income, which is calculated as wages per employee multiplied by the number of employees, 
has  continued  to increase.  This  is  because  nominal  wages  have  increased  for  the  past  few 
 6 
years and the positive rate of change in the number of employees has taken hold. Thus, the 
likely reason why prices have become more stable recently is that households' tolerance of 
price  rises  has  risen,  albeit  moderately,  with  the  employment  and  income  situation 
improving. 
 Now, I would like to move on to the outlook for prices (Chart 5). In the July 2019 Outlook 
Report,  the  medians  of  the  Policy  Board  members'  forecasts  of  the  year-on-year  rate  of 
change in the CPI excluding fresh food are 1.0 percent for fiscal 2019, 1.3 percent for fiscal 
2020, and 1.6 percent for fiscal 2021. Annual CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually, 
but it is expected to still take time to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent. While 
there are various reasons for this, it seems to be affected largely by the fact that the mindset 
and  behavior  based  on the  assumption  that  wages and  prices  will  not increase  easily  have 
been  deeply  entrenched,  due  mainly  to  the  experience  of  prolonged  low  growth  and 
deflation from the late 1990s. As I mentioned earlier, firms' cautious wage- and price-setting 
stance,  as  well  as  households'  cautiousness  toward  price  rises,  have  shifted  gradually  but 
have  not  yet  clearly  changed.  Firms  have  continued  to  make  efforts  to  absorb  upward 
pressure  of  costs  on  prices  by  increasing  labor-saving  investment  and  streamlining  their 
business  process.  In  addition,  the  progress  in  the  labor  force  participation  by  women  and 
seniors, which is desirable in terms of strengthening the growth potential of the economy as 
a whole, is another reason why it is taking time for prices to rise. 
 Although it is taking time, the inflation rate is expected to increase gradually going forward. 
For the past few years, the situation has taken hold in which the year-on-year rate of change 
in the CPI has  been positive, with the economy continuing on an expanding trend and the 
output  gap  having  been  substantially  positive.  The  output  gap  is  basically  expected  to 
remain  substantially  positive.  Under  these  circumstances,  firms'  moves  to  raise  prices  are 
likely to be more widespread as households' tolerance of price rises increases, reflecting a 
rise in wage growth rates, and  firms' stance shifts toward further raising prices. As people 
gain  the  collective  experience  of  increases  in  wages  and  prices,  the  mindset  and  behavior 
based  on  the  assumption  that  wages  and  prices  will  not  increase  easily  are  expected  to 
weaken gradually. In this situation, inflation expectations -- that is, people's expectations for 
future  price  developments  --  are  projected  to  rise  gradually.  As  these  developments  show, 
 7 
the Bank recognizes that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target has been 
maintained, whereby a positive output gap results in an increase in actual prices, leading to 
a rise in inflation expectations. However, attention should be paid to the possibility that the 
inflation  momentum  would  be  lost  through,  for  example,  shrinkage  of  the  output  gap  or 
fluctuations  in  financial  markets  if  risks  to  economic  activity  were  to  materialize, 
particularly regarding overseas economies, as I explained earlier. 
 III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy 
Next, I would like to explain the Bank's conduct of monetary policy.   
 The Bank has been conducting "QQE with Yield Curve Control" (Chart 10). Specifically, it 
sets the short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the target level of 10-year 
Japanese  government  bond  (JGB)  yields  at  around  zero  percent,  and  has  conducted 
large-scale  JGB  purchases  in  the  market.  Meanwhile,  10-year  yields  in  Japan  temporarily 
dropped to minus 0.195 percent amid the global decline in interest rates, and currently are at 
around  minus  0.15  percent.  In  addition,  the  Bank  has  purchased  assets  such  as 
exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices. 
 Under such powerful monetary easing measures, Japan's financial conditions have remained 
highly  accommodative.  Firms'  funding  costs  have  been  hovering  at  extremely  low  levels 
(Chart  11).  Lending  rates  have  been at around historical low  levels  of  around  0.5  percent, 
and  issuance  rates  for  corporate  bonds  have  been  at  extremely  low  levels  of  close  to  0 
percent.  In  addition,  financial  institutions'  lending  attitudes  have  been  active.  Under  these 
circumstances,  the  year-on-year  rate  of  increase  in  bank  lending  has  continued  to  register 
high growth in the range of 2-3 percent for more than six years, even in a situation where 
there have been excess savings in the household and corporate sectors on the whole. 
 Therefore, highly accommodative financial conditions under the powerful monetary easing 
have  stimulated  firms'  and  households'  spending  activities,  and  thereby  have  significantly 
contributed to the positive output gap. In order to achieve the price stability target, the Bank 
considers it important to maintain the momentum toward achieving the price stability target 
by  persistently  continuing  with  the  powerful  monetary  easing  and  thereby  maintaining  a 
 8 
positive output gap for as long as possible. 
 So  far,  I  have  talked  about  the  Bank's  basic  stance  of  monetary  policy  conduct.  As  I 
mentioned at the beginning, major central banks have been shifting their policy stance from 
monetary  tightening  to  monetary  easing  amid  high  uncertainties  over  the  global  economy. 
In this situation, many have posed questions about the future policy conduct of the Bank of 
Japan.  Therefore,  I  would  like  to  talk  about  the  basic  thinking  behind  the  relationship 
between the policy conduct of central banks abroad and that of the Bank of Japan. There are 
three points. 
 First, the basic principle of the policy conduct for any central bank is to pursue appropriate 
conduct  in  response  to  domestic  economic  and  price  developments,  and  their  policies 
should  not  be  directly  influenced  by  the  policy  stance  of  other  central  banks.  Second, 
however, if factors that lie behind the policy conduct of other central banks affect economic 
and price developments of its own economy, it is of course necessary to take those into full 
account.  The  recent  moves  by  the  Federal  Reserve  and  the  ECB  to  change  their  policy 
stance are due to considerable uncertainties over the global economy. It is also important for 
the Bank of Japan to examine the risks concerning overseas economies and how these will 
affect  Japan's  economic  activity  and  prices.  And  third,  policy  measures  of  major  central 
banks  warrant  close  monitoring  in  terms  of  their  impact  on  domestic  economic  and  price 
developments, as those measures will have certain effects on the global economy and global 
financial  markets.  On  this  point,  the  policy  rate  cut  by  the  Federal  Reserve  this  time  was 
intended  to  prevent  an  actual  slowdown  in  economic  activity  and  inflation  amid 
considerable uncertainties over the global economy.  This policy rate cut will affect Japan's 
economy through various channels such as financial and foreign exchange markets as well 
as  real  economic  activity.  Basically,  if  the  U.S.  economy  becomes  more  resilient,  positive 
effects are likely to be exerted on the global economy and in turn Japan's economy. 
 The Bank of Japan will continue to pursue policy conduct in an appropriate manner without 
preconception,  taking  account  of  developments  in  economic activity  and  prices  as  well  as 
financial  conditions  in  Japan,  while  carefully  examining  various  risks.  The  Bank  is  no 
different from other major central banks, in that it is prepared to take, if necessary, policy 
 9 
responses  in  order  to  prevent  the  risks  from  materializing,  while closely  monitoring  them. 
Based  on  this  thinking,  the  Bank  specified  in  the  statement  released  after  the  MPM  two 
days  ago  that  "the  Bank  will  not  hesitate  to  take  additional  easing  measures  if  there  is  a 
greater  possibility  that  the  momentum  toward  achieving  the  price  stability  target  will  be 
lost."  As  has  been  made  clear  already,  there  are  various  possible  measures  for  additional 
easing such as cutting the short-term policy interest rate, lowering the target level of 10-year 
JGB yields, expanding asset purchases, and accelerating the expansion of the monetary base. 
Combinations or applications of various measures also are possible. The Bank will take the 
most  appropriate  policy  responses  depending  on  the  situation  at  the  time,  while  weighing 
their  benefits  and  costs  and  also  taking  full  account  of  the  viewpoint  of  preventing  the 
materialization of a risk that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will 
be lost. 
 Conclusion 
Lastly, I would like to talk about the economy of Kagoshima Prefecture. 
 In line with developments in Japan's economy as a whole, the prefecture's economic activity 
has been affected by the slowdown in overseas economies, mainly in terms of production, 
but  it  likely  has  continued  to  recover  moderately  led  mainly  by  domestic  demand.  Private 
consumption  has  been  firm,  reflecting  the  improvement  in  the  employment  and  income 
situation; in addition, tourism has remained solid, supported by an increase in both domestic 
and foreign visitors. Under these circumstances, business sentiment has remained favorable, 
and business fixed investment has grown steadily, supported mainly by strategic investment 
and labor-saving investment carried out from a medium- to long-term perspective. 
 On the other hand, some have been worried about the outlook for the prefecture's economy 
from  a  somewhat  medium-  to  long-term  perspective.  The  likely  reason  behind  this  is 
concern  about  a  shrinking  of  its  market  and  shortage  of  human  resources  to  support  its 
economy in the face of issues such as the declining birthrate and aging population and the 
declining population overall. 
  10 
However,  I  believe  that  the  people  of  this  prefecture  can  overcome  these  issues.  This  is 
because  Kagoshima  Prefecture  has  a  history  of  overcoming  various  hardships  and 
successfully transforming itself. During the Edo era, the Satsuma clan faced a fiscal crisis, 
but  it  overcame  this  by  expanding  trade  not  only  within  the  country  but  also  with  foreign 
countries through the Ryukyu Islands. At that time, in addition to developing trading routes 
using, for example, kitamaebune, or northern-bound ships, it focused on expanding trade in 
regional  products  such  as  kokuto  brown  sugar.  These  efforts  became  the  driving  force 
behind Japan's modernization by incorporating cutting-edge technologies such as those for 
steelmaking  and  spinning  from  overseas  and  developing  them  further,  as  seen  in  the 
subsequent  Shuseikan  industrial  complex.  In  addition,  by  exhibiting  Satsuma  ware  and 
earning high praise for it at the Paris Expo in 1867, the clan succeeded in establishing the 
"Satsuma"  brand.  Moreover,  what  supported  this  series  of  transformations  was  the 
development  of  human  resources,  such  as  through  the  traditional  Goju  education  system 
that the clan established and the dispatch of exchange students to the United Kingdom. 
 In  studying  this  history,  I  feel  that  it  has  many  parallels  with  the  transformations  that  are 
required  right  now,  which  the  prefecture  already  has  been  pursuing  in  fact.  Examples 
include  efforts  to  make  inroads  into  markets  outside  the  region,  including  abroad,  while 
refining  the  brand  value  of  agricultural  and  livestock  products  such  as  Kagoshima  Black 
Beef,  which  has  become  the  top  beef  brand  in  Japan.  In  addition,  the  prefecture  has 
strengthened its efforts to attract tourists by taking  advantage of its rich natural resources, 
such  as  Yakushima,  which  is  registered  as  a  World  Natural  Heritage  site,  its  safe  and 
high-quality food, and its abundant hot springs. The prefecture also has made efforts to use 
cutting-edge  digital  technologies,  such  as  the  implementation  of  smart  farming  and 
expansion of cashless payment services. Furthermore, with the involvement of Kagoshima 
University,  collaboration  between the  industries,  academics  and  research  institutions,  and 
the  administration  has  been  strengthened  in  order  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  these 
efforts.  It  is  reassuring  that  these  initiatives  demonstrate  the  enterprising  spirit  etched  into 
the DNA of the people of the prefecture. 
 I sincerely hope that Kagoshima Prefecture, which in the past has turned various hardships 
into  positive  transformations,  finds  a  new  way  forward  and  further  develops  its  economy 
 11 
based on the initiatives that are currently under way.

Notes: 2. In the right chart, figures for the global economy are the "J.P. Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI." Figures for advanced economies as well as emerging and commodity-exporting 
economies are calculated as the weighted averages of the Manufacturing PMI using GDP shares of world total GDP from the IMF as weights. Advanced economies consist of the 
United States, the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Emerging and commodity-exporting economies consist of 17 countries and regions, such as China, South Korea, Taiwan,
Russia, and Brazil.
