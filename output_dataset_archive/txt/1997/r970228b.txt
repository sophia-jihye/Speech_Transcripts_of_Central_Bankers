Mr. Macfarlane discusses the economics of nostalgia   Talk by the Governor of
the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr. I.J. Macfarlane, to The Sydney Institute on 11/2/97.
1.  Introduction
It is a  great  pleasure  to  be  speaking  at  The  Sydney  Institute,  which  has  done  so
much  over  recent  years  to  keep  alive  informed  discussion  of  public  affairs  and  the  arts.  In
keeping with this tradition, I have chosen to speak on a subject with a historical, economic and
political  theme.  I  would  like  to  look  back  at  the  1950s  and  1960s,  and  evaluate  some  of  the
lessons  that  people  take  from  this  period.  The  further  my  professional  life  proceeds,  the  more
value I see in a good knowledge of economic history, even if it is so recent that most of us have
lived and worked through it. As you will gather, my views on history are much closer to George
Santayana’s than to Henry Ford’s.
There can be  no  quibble  with  the  proposition  that  macro-economic  performance
in  the  immediate  post-war  period,  which  for  present  purposes  I  will  refer  to  as  the  1950s  and
1960s, was far superior to any period before or after. This has led a lot of people to use it as a
basis for proposing economic policies for today. They look back at how things were done in the
1950s  and  1960s,  and  say  “if  only  we  did  it  the  same  way  today,  our  macro-economic
performance would be as good as it was then”. This approach has some merit but, if we are to
use it, it is very important that we get our facts straight about what the policies actually were in
the 1950s and 1960s.
There are two propositions of policy relevance that are frequently made about this
period.  The  first  one  is  that  the  macro-economic  success  at  that  time  was  due  to  the  use  of
activist  and  expansionary  fiscal  and  monetary  policies.  The  second  is  that  the  world  economy
was moving along very smoothly in the post-war period, with everything under control, until hit
by  the  external  shock  of  the  OPEC-induced  oil  price  rise  in  late  1973  (and  again  in  1979).  I
would like to analyse these two propositions with particular reference to Australia, but in doing
so  it  will  be  necessary  to  bring  in  a  lot  of  international  economic  and  political  events,
particularly those occurring in the United States.
2.  Macro-economic  performance  in  the  1950s  and  1960s
It is not necessary to spend much time demonstrating how successful this period
was in terms of macro-economic performance because no-one disputes it. Table 1 shows that the
real growth  rate  for  the  world  economy  was  more  than  twice  as  high  in  the  1950-1973  period
than  in  the  previous  80  years.  In  Australia  there  was  also  a  major  improvement,  although  less
than a doubling. Inflation, which had been negligible on average  until  the  Second  World  War,
rose  to  about  4  per  cent  in  the  1950-1973  period,  with  the  average  being  pushed  up  by  the
Korean War period and the early 1970s. At other times it was a good deal lower, and even with
these periods  included,  it  was  moderate  enough  to  permit  economic  expansion  for  most  of  the
period.  Unemployment  remained  low  throughout  the  period,  although  there  was  some  cyclical
movement at times. Overall, macro-economic performance was considerably better in this period
than  in  any  time  before  or  since,  which  has  prompted  economic  historians  such  as  Maddison
(1991) to refer to this period as the “Golden Age”.

There  were  a  number  of  factors  behind  this  impressive  economic  performance,  but  time  and
space  limit  me  to  mentioning  only  the  main  ones.  The  four  most  important,  I  believe,  are  as
follows:
(i) There was a big gap to be made up following the Depression and
the Second World War. The 1950s and 1960s was a period of post-war reconstruction
or “catch-up” for most countries. The largest growth pick-up occurred in the countries
most devastated by the war, such as Germany, Italy, Japan and Austria, and the least
pronounced (although still significant) were in the United States, Canada, Switzerland,
Sweden and Australia.
(ii) Although  populations  and  governments  were  eager  for  economic
growth, there was widespread restraint in economic behaviour. The privations endured
during the Depression and the War meant that as incomes rose, a high proportion was
saved.  Inflationary  expectations  too  had  been  conditioned  by  decades  of  nearly  zero
inflation, which showed up in modest pricing and wage setting behaviour for much of
the  period.  Some  commentators  also  stress  the  political  cohesion  among  western
countries as a result of the ever-present influence of the Cold War.
(iii) International  trade  was  liberalised  and  exports  and  imports  grew
rapidly. This was a sharp contrast with the inter-war period. Maddison says “perhaps
the least controversial assertion one can make about the Golden Age is that it involved
a  remarkable  revival  of  liberalism  in  international  transactions.  Trade  and  payment
barriers  erected  in  the  1930s  and  during  the  War  were  removed.  The  new-style
liberalism was buttressed by effective arrangements  for  regular  consultation  between
Western Countries and for mutual financial assistance” (IMF, OECD and GATT (now
WTO).)
(iv) Governments  conducted  good  macro-economic  policies  with  a
greater  emphasis  on  economic  growth  than  in  previous  decades.  In  a  number  of
countries  the  new-found  commitment  to  growth  and  low  unemployment  was
enshrined in legislation. In others it was less formal,  but  in  nearly  every  country  the
first  decades  after  the  Second  World  War  were  characterised  by  well-balanced  and
successful  macro-economic  policies.  A  more  detailed  examination  of 
these
macro-economic policies, particularly in Australia, is the subject of my next section.
BIS Review   20/1997
3.  The  role  of  macro-economic  policies
- 3 -
There  is  no  doubt  that  the  dominant  principle  behind  macro-economic  policy
changed after the Second World War in line with Keynesian teaching, but the change occurred
more quickly in some countries than others.
The  main  change  was  that  fiscal  policy  was  to  be  used  actively  to  promote
economic growth by deliberately incurring budget  deficits  at  times  of  weak  economic  activity.
Fiscal policy and monetary policy together were termed  demand  management  policy,  and  they
were  to  be  adjusted  to  smooth  the  business  cycle,  to  increase  growth  and  to  achieve  full
employment. In Australia’s case, this approach was enshrined in a document  -  the  1945  White
Paper, “Full Employment in Australia”.
This  approach  to  policy  was  very  successful  in  that  it  achieved  its  aims  of  high
growth rates and low unemployment for several decades, and it did so with generally low rates
of inflation. The achievement was all the greater, given that the 1950s contained a major shock
in the form of the Korean War commodity price boom. This high level of success has led many
people  to  assume  that  policy  must  have  been  operated  with  a  high  degree  of  activism,  i.e.  by
choosing very expansionary settings of policy. But this was not the case. For most of the period
we  are  considering,  demand  management  policy  was  quite  restrained  and,  where  necessary,
restrictive. Certainly its guiding principle was Keynesian, but it was operated in a very balanced
way and was, in any case, subject to an important constraint, which I will come to later.
That  this  was  the  case  should  not  be  a  surprise  to  people  who  remember  the
period. For example, the Fadden “Horror Budget” of 1951/52 and the “Credit Squeeze” of 1961,
which  nearly  cost  the  Menzies  Government  office,  have  gone  into  folklore.  Of  course,  there
were  also  periods  where  policy  was  expansionary,  but  on  average  the  result  was  relatively
balanced. While growth was high, on average, there was also a business cycle operating during
this period, with a couple of reasonably clearly defined recessions and booms.
The fact that policy was well balanced can be shown for fiscal policy by a couple
of graphs.  Unfortunately, comparable data do not go back earlier than 1961/62, so we will have
to  lose  the  1950s  from  our  comparisons.  Diagram  1  shows  the  best  general  measure  of  the
underlying budget deficit. In the 12 years from 1961/62 to 1973/74 the budget was, on average,

in surplus to the extent of ½ per cent of GDP, and the fluctuations around the average were not
very large. In the period since then, the budget has nearly always been in deficit, with an average
deficit  of  nearly  2  per  cent  of  GDP.  You  can  see  the  three  attempts  made  to  bring  it  back
towards  surplus  -  the  first  one  when  Mr. Howard  was  Treasurer,  the  second  one  under  Mr.
Keating as Treasurer, and the third one which is being continued at the moment by Mr. Costello.
In summary, it is the more recent period that could be characterised as activist and expansionary
in  that  there  are  bigger  swings  in  the  budgetary  position  and,  on  average,  it  tends  to  show  a
much bigger deficit.

Another measure of fiscal activism is the size of government expenditure relative
to  the  economy.  It  will  come  as  no  surprise  to  see  that  general  government  outlays  relative  to
GDP were much lower in the 1960s than they  are  now  (Diagram  2);  in  the  earlier  period  they
accounted for about 25 per cent of GDP, but over the last two decades they have averaged 34 per
cent of GDP.
The stance of monetary policy is  more  difficult  to  analyse  because  interest  rates
cannot  be  used  as  the  measure  of  comparison.  This  is  because  before  the  early  1980s  the
financial system was heavily regulated, with the Government imposing interest rate ceilings on
most forms of lending. Tightenings and easings in monetary policy showed up largely  through
credit rationing - the ease or difficulty in obtaining a loan at a given interest rate. This would be
familiar to people who can remember the difficulty of obtaining a housing mortgage at that time.
The best way of judging whether monetary policy was tight or loose in such a system was to see
how  fast  it  allowed  money  and  credit  to  grow.    The  growth  of  the  money  supply  is  shown  in
Diagram  3,  and  again  we  see  relatively  low  and  stable  expansion  during  the  1950s  and  1960s
(except for the Korean War boom), before the turmoil starts in the 1970s (in this case, the very
early 1970s).
I referred earlier to the fact that monetary and fiscal policy had to operate under
an important constraint during the 1950s and 1960s. The constraint to which I am referring is the
gold exchange standard, whereby virtually all OECD countries fixed their exchange rate to the
US dollar, which in turn fixed to gold. In Australia’s case, our exchange rate to the US dollar did
not change between 1949 and 1971. This was in a way the centrepiece of our economic policy.
BIS Review   20/1997

Monetary policy and fiscal policy could not get too expansionary without either inflation or the
balance of payments threatening the exchange rate. This mechanism effectively  meant  that  our
macro-economic policies (and those of most OECD economies) could not get too far out of line
with  the  policies  pursued  by  the  US  Government.  A  recognition  of  this  link  means  that  if  we
wish to fully understand what happened in the 1950s, 1960s and  early  1970s,  we  have  to  look
more  closely  at  the  trends  in  US  economic  policy.  This  also  means  that  we  will  have  to  stop
looking  at  the  1950s,  1960s  and  early  1970s  as  a  whole,  and  instead  divide  it  into  two  quite
different sub-periods.

4.  The  end  of  the  Golden  Age
The  role  of  the  United  States  is  crucial  here.  Despite  its  having  enacted  the
Employment  Act  of  1946,  the  United  States  continued  to  run  reasonably  conservative  demand
management policies through the Truman and Eisenhower years and even in the early part of the
Kennedy Presidency. In this period US economic policy came in for a fair bit of criticism from
economists, particularly outside the United States, for being too cautious. There was some basis
to  this  criticism  in  that  US  policy  makers  did  seem  to  be  less  keen  to  expand  than  their
counterparts in other countries, particularly in Europe.
American  attitudes  changed  in  the  early  1960s,  but  nothing  concrete  occurred
until the Johnson years. The turning point was the tax cuts introduced in 1964 and 1965 which
were described by one of their architects - Arthur Okun - as “The largest stimulative fiscal action
ever undertaken by the federal government in peacetime ... the first  major  stimulative  measure
adopted  in  the  post-war  era  at  a  time  when  the  economy  was  neither  in,  nor  threatened
imminently  by,  recession.  And,  unlike  earlier  tax  reductions,  they  were  taken  in  a  budgetary
situation marked by the twin facts that the federal budget was in deficit and federal expenditures
were rising.” This certainly got the United  States  moving  and  was  soon  followed  by  increased
defence  expenditure  occasioned  by  the  Vietnam  War,  and  other  government  expenditure
associated with the Great Society programs. Some of the proponents of the original tax cuts then
argued for tax increases but, not surprisingly, they found these were harder to put into place than
were the earlier tax cuts.

In  the  second  half  of  the  1960s  and  early  1970s  the  US  economy  grew  very
quickly and inflation began to rise. For a time it was held in check by the Fed’s willingness to
run  a  tight  monetary  policy,  but  with  the  appointment  of  Arthur  Burns  as  Fed  Chairman,
monetary  policy  became  more  accommodating.  President  Nixon  found  that  expansionary
policies  were  popular,  and  continued  in  the  same  vein  as  his  predecessor.  By  1971,  with  the
United States running a large current account deficit, it could no longer hold its commitment to
gold and the US dollar was effectively devalued against gold and against other major currencies.

There  was  now  no  longer  an  anchor  to  the  international  financial  system.  Thus,  the  post-war
period  should  really  be  divided  into  two  sub-periods,  with  the  US  tax  cuts  of  1965  marking  a
convenient dividing line. Thereafter, US policy became expansionary, and it ceased to provide a
constraint on the actions of other countries.
It is instructive  to  see  what  happened  in  a  range  of  countries  during  this  second
period, that is between the turning point in US policy in 1965 and the OPEC shock at the end of
1973.  The  story  is  very  similar  for  all  OECD  countries.  Their  economies  continued  to  grow
strongly,  but  they  were  not  able  to  get  their  unemployment  any  lower  than  the  already  low
starting point (see Table 2).The main effect of these expansionary policies was to push inflation
to  levels  that  were  not  consistent  with  sustainable  economic  growth.  As  a  general  rule,  most
countries’ unemployment rates rose slightly, but their inflation rates doubled (see Table 3). By
1972 and 1973 the world economy was in an inflationary boom. How did Australia fare in this
period?
Our  story  was  very  similar  to  the  general  pattern,  although  the  deterioration  in
inflation  was  more  marked  here.  Our  inflation  rate,  which  had  been  about  4  per  cent  in  the
mid-1960s, reached 10.4 per cent in the year to the September quarter of 1973. That means that
we  had  already  got  our  inflation  rate  into  double  digits  before  OPEC  came  along  to  deliver  a
further  inflationary  impulse  (see  Diagram  4).  Our  problems  were  compounded  by  the
inflationary boom that the world found itself in 1972 and 1973. Commodity prices were rising
rapidly, as  were  our  export  receipts.  With  the  monetary  policy  instruments  then  available,  and
with  the  fixed  exchange  rate,  it  was  not  possible  to  quarantine  the  monetary  effects,  and  the
money supply was soon growing at more than 20 per cent per annum. We did not help ourselves
very  much  either  with  the  way  we  set  wages.  The  National  Wage  Case  of  December  1970
resulted in a 6 per cent increase in awards, and the metals industry award of July 1971 added 9
per cent to award wages through that year (when inflation was 5.1 per cent).

The  point  of  all  this  analysis  is  to  answer  the  second  proposition  that  was
presented in the Introduction. Was the world achieving good macro-economic performance until
hit by the OPEC shocks? The answer is clearly no. In the period after 1965, policies became too
ambitious and too expansionary. In colloquial terms, we all lost the plot. Of course, it is easy for
BIS Review   20/1997
- 8 -
me to say these things now because I have the benefit of hindsight - it was much harder at the
time to see that we were overstretching ourselves.
By 1973, the world economy already had an entrenched inflationary problem, not
just  a  temporary  one  as  in  the  Korean  War  period.  Whether  OPEC  had  come  along  or  not,  it
would still have been necessary to re-examine demand management policies and do  something
about restoring the sort of conditions that existed in the 1945-65 period. History shows that what
we got instead was an oil price shock to add to our already considerable self-imposed troubles,
and so spent the next decade-and-a-half trying to return to some sort of reasonable equilibrium. I
do not want to say anything about that period because that is another story.
5.  Conclusion
The  period  that  is  loosely  described  as  the  1950s  and  1960s  really  covers  the
nearly  three  decades  between  the  end  of  the  Second  World  War  and  the  first  oil  price  shock
known as OPEC I. Macro-economic policies were successful for most of this time in  that  they
avoided  the  deflation  that  had  characterised  the  1930s,  and  yet  did  not  move  too  far  in  the
inflationary direction.
However, a closer examination of the whole period suggests that there were two
quite distinct sub-periods. The first, from 1945 to 1965 or thereabouts, was the true Golden Age
in  that  sustainable  growth  with  low  inflation  was  achieved  against  a  background  of  macro-
economic policies that did not try to be too ambitious in the short run. The second period, from
1965 to 1973, looked promising for a time, but was ultimately a period of policy failure. Macro-
economic policy tried to achieve too much and forgot about the need for sustainability. It ended
up  with  the  world  economy  in  an  inflationary  boom,  which  set  the  scene  for  oil  prices  to  rise
sharply, as had all other commodity prices during the boom. A policy reversal aimed at restoring
the  more  balanced  approach  of  the  1945-65  period  would  have  been  needed  even  without  the
shock of OPEC.
