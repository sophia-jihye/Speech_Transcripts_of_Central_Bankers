Summary  of  an  article  entitled  Risk  Disclosure  by  Financial  Institutions

Introduction
Public  disclosure  by  financial  institutions  has  long  provided  information  about
business performance through the publication of financial statements. In recent years, however, a
number  of  financial  institutions  have  come  to  focus  on  disclosure  of  a  wider  range  of
information, including their management policies. This is partly attributable to the expansion of
derivatives transactions, which has made risk management techniques increasingly important in
the management of financial institutions, and which has thereby encouraged financial institutions
to improve such techniques. Accordingly, individual financial  institutions  have  been  motivated
to  reveal  voluntarily  their  risk  exposures  and  risk  management  methods  in  order  to  win  a
favorable  assessment  from  market  participants.  Disclosure  thus  brings  into  play  a  check
mechanism inherent in financial markets (hereafter referred to as the market check mechanism)
that disciplines management of financial institutions, and thereby helps to enhance the efficiency
and transparency of the markets and to stabilize the financial system.
This  report  examines  the  disclosure  of  information  on  risks  of  financial
institutions, with an overview of  the  current  practices  and  future  issues.  It  is  intended  to  serve
market participants, the beneficiaries of the information disclosed.
