Mr. Brash speaks on monetary policy in New Zealand   Address by the Governor
of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  New  Zealand,  Dr.  Donald  T.  Brash,  before  the  Auckland  Chamber  of
Commerce, in Auckland, on 20/4/98.
I  very  much  appreciate  this  opportunity  to  address  such  an  important  Auckland
audience at this time.  We all know that, on 18 March, the Reserve Bank announced a further easing
of monetary policy, an easing which was rather larger than most people had been expecting.  Since
then, the exchange rate has fallen and interest rates have risen (especially at the short end of the yield
curve).
These developments have led to a great deal of puzzlement and some anger.  What
kind of easing is it which leads to an increase in interest rates?  Hasn’t Don Brash become just like
Rob  Muldoon,  interfering  in  the  market  and  manipulating  first  this  lever  and  then  that  -  perhaps
initially  focused  on  keeping  inflation  low  but  now,  worried  by  the  balance  of  payments  deficit,
pushing down the exchange rate to help reduce that deficit and pushing up interest rates to punish
Auckland house buyers?  Why do we need the Reserve Bank interfering in financial markets at all,
now that we have a largely deregulated economy?  Surely the easing was totally ‘botched’?
This morning I want to answer those charges.  (I will not be making any comments on
the current level of the MCI, or about what the Bank might or might not do about it.)
Central banks are an ‘intervention’, but the RBNZ is not ‘Muldoonist’
Let  me  begin  by  stating  at  the  outset  that  central  banks  are  an  intervention  in  the
economy.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand probably has less direct control over financial market
prices  than  any  other  central  bank  in  the  world  -  we  haven’t  intervened  in  the  foreign  exchange
market  for  13  years,  for  example,  and  don’t  fix  any  single  interest  rate  -  but  I  do  not  deny  for  a
moment that we intervene to influence overall monetary conditions.
I  do  not  want  to  be  side-tracked  into  a  long  debate  about  the  virtues  of  having  a
central bank, beyond simply observing that for all practical purposes we either have our own central
bank, as the great majority of countries do, or we abandon our own currency and use the services of
some other central bank, such as Hong Kong and Argentina effectively do (they use the services of
the US central bank of course).  As long as we want to retain our own money, we need to have a
monetary policy, and some institutional structure with which to implement that monetary policy.
The key issue is what that institution, typically a central bank, should try to achieve
with its powers.  I presume that those who accuse us of having become ‘Muldoonist’ believe that we
have given up our single-minded pursuit of price stability and have instead started using monetary
policy to achieve other objectives, perhaps trying to help to reduce the balance of payments deficit or
trying  to  deflate  property  prices.    Some  people  have  of  course  welcomed  this  ‘more  pragmatic
approach’.  I don’t think even our worst critics have accused us of manipulating monetary policy for
political purposes, which of course was one of the accusations levelled against Rob Muldoon.
So let me say it again: monetary policy has been  exclusively  focused  on  delivering
low inflation in accordance with the target agreed with Government (initially 0 to 2 per cent, now
0 to  3  per  cent)  since  at  least  the  time  I  was  appointed  Governor,  now  almost  10  years  ago.
Monetary  policy  remains  focused  exclusively  on  that  objective.    Indeed,  any  other  focus  for
monetary policy would be inconsistent with the legislation under which the Reserve Bank operates,
passed without dissent in 1989.
But it is important to recall that price stability was not chosen as the single objective
of monetary policy because Parliament thought that other objectives were unimportant.  Rather, by
the  late  eighties  it  had  become  increasingly  recognised  here  and  abroad  that  the  best  contribution
BIS Review   36/1998

which monetary policy could make to those other objectives - social justice, growth in employment,
growth in output - was to deliver predictably stable prices.  And indeed, this point is now recognised
quite explicitly in the wording of the Policy Targets Agreement between the Treasurer and myself.
Monetary policy aimed at stable prices assists social justice by avoiding the kind of
capricious transfers of income and wealth which are the inevitable result of inflation.
Monetary policy aimed at stable prices assists growth in output and jobs by helping
the price system, which is at the heart of the market economy, work more effectively.
And monetary policy aimed at stable prices assists the economy by helping to smooth
business  cycles.    Ah,  you  say,  he  admits  it:  the  Reserve  Bank  is  using  monetary  policy  to  try  to
smooth the business cycle.  No, I am not saying that at all.  What I am saying is that when monetary
policy is aimed at delivering stable prices it has the ancillary benefit that the business cycle may be
smoothed  to  some  degree  also.    Why?    Because  the  situations  where  inflationary  pressures  are
increasing are by their nature usually situations where demand in the economy is running ahead of
the  economy’s  long-term  capacity  to  supply,  so  that  monetary  policy  aimed  at  restraining  those
inflationary  pressures  inevitably  tends  to  dampen  down  booms.    And  conversely,  those  situations
where demand falls short of the economy’s long-term capacity to supply are usually situations where
inflationary pressures are falling towards zero, so that monetary policy aimed at preventing inflation
falling  below  zero  (as  required  by  my  agreement  with  the  Treasurer)  inevitably  tends  to  work  to
mitigate those downturns.
In determining the stance of monetary policy, we are inevitably trying to assess what
future inflation pressures will be.  That means we are always trying to assess how demand pressures
will evolve relative to the economy’s ability to supply.  Are we primarily trying to smooth business
cycles?  No, we are trying to maintain consistently low inflation within  the target  we  have  agreed
with Government, but one of the corollaries, one of the ancillary benefits, is that, if we get it right,
the  business  cycle  will  be  somewhat  moderated  also  -  less  vigorous  booms  and  less  recessionary
busts.    As  one  of  America’s  leading  monetary  policy  economists,  Larry  Ball  of  Johns  Hopkins
University,  has  recently  argued,  even  if  you  were  mainly  concerned  to  smooth  output  and
employment cycles, focusing monetary policy on delivering predictably low inflation would be the
most sensible way of running monetary policy.
So  let’s  make  this  abundantly  clear.    The  Reserve  Bank  has  not  had  some  sort  of
road-to-Damascus experience.  We have not decided that inflation matters less and that we have to
‘go for growth’.  We have not decided to fix the current account.  We have not decided to get the
farmers back in the black.  And we have certainly not, as columnist Chris Trotter put it, anticipated
‘the National Government’s political needs’.  The easing process that is now underway is absolutely
intrinsic  to,  and  an  inevitable  result  of,  the  monetary  policy  framework  that  has  applied  in
New Zealand since the passage of the 1989 Reserve Bank Act.  More precisely, it is the inevitable
result of an inflation target which has an upper and a lower limit.  Recent events are therefore just
‘business as usual’.
Recent changes in interest rates and the exchange rate
But, you ask, hasn’t the Reserve Bank just deliberately knocked down the exchange
rate and increased interest rates?  Doesn’t that suggest that the Bank has taken its eye off the price
stability ball, and is now trying to manipulate conditions in order to reduce the balance of payments
deficit?  That is certainly a widespread perception, but it is totally wrong.
For a very long time, the Bank has argued that, while we can tighten monetary policy
or we can ease monetary policy, we can not control the way in which these policy adjustments affect
monetary  conditions.    Put  another  way,  the  mix  of  monetary  conditions  is  determined  by  the
BIS Review   36/1998
- 3 -
decisions and perceptions of countless thousands of individuals, borrowers and savers, both within
New Zealand and overseas.
Let me illustrate that point first by looking not at the events of the last few weeks and
months  but  rather  at  the  period  during  which  monetary  policy  was  being  tightened  to  head  off
emerging inflationary pressures from early 1994.  Graph 1 shows how overall monetary conditions
tightened from the beginning of 1994 through to late 1996.  In 1994, that tightening took the form of
both an increase in  interest  rates  and  an increase in  the  exchange  rate, as  shown  in  Graph  2.    But
through 1995 and 1996, as exporters and those competing with imports know only too well, interest
rates fluctuated through quite a narrow band while the exchange rate continued to increase strongly.
Indeed,  at  times  the  overall  firming  of  conditions  took  the  form  of  an  actual  fall  in  interest  rates,
more than offset, in terms of the effect on inflationary pressures, by a strong increase in the exchange
rate.

Were overall monetary conditions firming through that period, even though  interest
rates were stable and sometimes falling?  In my view they were, and I suspect that most exporters
and those competing with imports are in full agreement.
Was the situation ideal?  In my view it was not.  From our point of view in the central
bank, it meant that interest rates stayed too low to restrain the very strong growth in borrowing which
occurred through that period, which in turn meant that there was insufficient disinflationary pressure
on those domestic sectors of the economy which were the source of so much of the inflation in those
years.    Conversely,  the  strong  increase  in  the  exchange  rate  was  putting  more  and  more
disinflationary pressure on those sectors of the economy in competition with the rest of the world,
even though inflation in those sectors was very low.  I occasionally expressed my unhappiness with
that particular mix of monetary conditions, but I recognised that I was not able to change it.
Over the last year or so of course the process has been substantially reversed.  The
Bank  has  been  progressively  willing  to  ease  overall  monetary  conditions,  and  the  extent  of  this
easing since the end of 1996 is also shown in Graph 1.  But as can be seen in Graph 3, all of the
easing, indeed more than all of the easing, has taken the form of a fall in the exchange rate, offset in
part by some increase in interest rates.
Is this new mix of monetary conditions surprising?  Not really, given the widespread
perception that New Zealand’s balance of payments deficit has reached a high level and given the
still-strong demand by New Zealanders to borrow.  In other words, our strong demand to borrow and
our reluctance to save require us to attract the savings of foreigners.  Since those foreign savers have
seen an increasing risk that the New Zealand dollar might depreciate, we have had to pay increasing
interest rates to offset that perceived risk of currency depreciation.

Is the new mix of monetary conditions in some sense undesirable?  I am sure it must
seem so to many indebted companies and households.  On the other hand, I am equally confident that
there are a great number of people in the export sector, and in companies competing with imports,
who  are  absolutely  delighted  by  the  change  in  the  mix  of  monetary  conditions.    So  also  are  those
people  who  derive  income  from  their  savings.    Predictably,  most  of  them  are  not  issuing  press
statements  expressing  their  delight,  so  the  overall  impression  created  is  that  the  whole  country  is
miserable about the change.
In my own view, the change in the mix of monetary conditions which we have seen
over  the  last  year  or  so  has  been  a  positive  development  for  the  economy’s  medium-term
development.  It should certainly assist in reducing the currently large balance of payments deficit.
Having  said  that,  however,  the  balance  of  payments  is  not  an  objective  of  monetary  policy  -  and
that’s just as well because, as I have noted already, monetary policy has no ability to influence the
mix of monetary conditions.
But  didn’t  the  Reserve  Bank  deliberately  change  the  mix,  by  projecting  a  weaker
exchange  rate  and  higher  interest  rates  in  its  quarterly  inflation  projections?    Certainly,  we  did
project an easing in overall monetary conditions over the next year or so and, because we have to
make some assumption about how that easing will be reflected in interest rates and the exchange rate
in order to complete our inflation projection, we did indicate that we expected that easing to take the
form  of  a  somewhat  reduced  exchange  rate  and  broadly  unchanged  interest  rates  (at  least  through
1998).  But we have routinely disclosed the interest and exchange rate assumptions underlying our
inflation projections, and financial markets have understood that these are not assumptions which we
necessarily  expect  to  see  realised,  let  alone  assumptions  which  we  can  in  some  way  enforce  on
financial  markets.    In  December  1997,  for  example,  we  projected  that  the  exchange  rate  would
remain broadly unchanged at 64.2 on the Trade-Weighted Index and the 90 day interest rate would
stay at around 7.6 per cent through the first half of 1998.  Well before our March projections were
published,  the  exchange  rate  had  fallen  well  below  64.2  and  interest  rates  had  risen  above
7.6 per cent.  Neither in December 1997 nor in March 1998 were our assumptions about the path of
interest and exchange rates intended to direct financial markets to particular outcomes.
BIS Review   36/1998

But hasn’t the Reserve Bank’s easing been ‘botched’ in some way?  Has there really
been an easing at all?  On those questions I have not the slightest doubt.
One  can  debate  whether  the  Bank’s  Monetary  Conditions  Index  is  correctly
calibrated, whether a 2 per cent fall in the exchange rate is equivalent to a 100 basis point movement
in  90  day  interest  rates.    One  can  debate  whether  the  Bank’s  Trade-Weighted  Index  correctly
measures movements in the New Zealand dollar.  One can debate whether the 90-day interest rate
correctly  measures  movements  in  New  Zealand  interest  rates.    And  I  am  familiar  with  all  of  that
debate.  (We dealt with several of these issues in the March 1998 Economic Projections, and in my
speaking notes for journalists in releasing that document.)  But if we accept, as I believe we must,
that in a small, open economy monetary policy works to affect the real economy and, in that way,
inflation through both interest rates and the exchange rate, then I don’t have the slightest doubt that
overall  monetary  conditions  have  eased  in  New  Zealand  in  recent  months,  and  indeed  have  eased
quite considerably.  That easing has taken the form of a sharp fall in the exchange rate  which  has
been partly offset by an increase in short-term interest rates (the increase in longer-term interest rates
has been much more moderate).
I have often conceded that the MCI is not a perfect measure of monetary conditions.
We  will  continue  to  seek  ways  to  improve  it.    But  as  a  rule-of-thumb  to  guide  financial  markets
between  quarterly  projections  it  has  proven  enormously  useful.    It  has  assisted  us  through  a  very
major  rebalancing  of  monetary  conditions  at  a  time  of  great  turbulence  in  financial  markets
internationally, with an absolute minimum of drama.  Yes, interest rates have gone up, but given our
balance  of  payments  deficit  -  or  in  other  words,  our  huge  appetite  for  borrowing  and  our  national
aversion to saving - that should not be a matter for surprise or regret.  If as a nation we become less
enthusiastic  about  borrowing  or  more  enthusiastic  about  saving,  we  can  expect  interest  rates  to
decline to the levels which would seem to be justified by our low inflation.
In  conclusion,  I  think  it  is  important  that  we  all  look  at  recent  events  objectively.
Right  now,  the  New  Zealand  economy  is  having  to  adapt  to  a  complex  set  of  circumstances,
including an increase in government expenditure, a reduction in taxation, a changing housing market,
and,  coming  rapidly  over  the  horizon,  the  negative  implications  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis.    Yet
what  we  see  is  adjustment  to  these  new  circumstances,  taking  place  within  existing  structures,
without  great  drama.    Monetary  policy,  with  its  single  focus  on  price  stability  and  its  total
transparency,  has  reacted  as  it  must,  smoothly  and  objectively.    The  markets  too  are  dealing  with
changed circumstances and creating a context within which New Zealand can be more internationally
competitive.  This is ‘business as usual’.
