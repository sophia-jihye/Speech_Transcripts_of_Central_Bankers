Mr Bäckström covers monetary policy in Sweden from 1996 to 1998
Opening  remarks  by  Mr  Urban  Bäckström,  Governor  of  Sveriges  Riksbank,  the  Swedish
central bank, before the Standing Committee on Finance in Stockholm on 18 May 1999.
Introduction
In the period 1996–98 the annual rates of inflation, measured with the CPI, were 0.8, 0.9 and
0.4 per cent, respectively. This means that in each of these years the change in the CPI not
only deviated from monetary policy’s 2 per cent target for price stability but was also outside
the lower tolerance limit of 1 per cent inflation.
The Riksbank has indeed made assessments that subsequently proved to be a bit off the mark.
As a result we have also made decisions that, looking  back  when  the  outcome  was  known,
could have been somewhat different. But on the whole, the result of monetary policy in this
period  seems  to  be  acceptable.  In  my  opening  remarks  I  intend  to  give  this  appraisal  more
substance.
One major reason why CPI inflation has been low in the past three years is that the price trend
has  been  affected  by  some  specific  price  movements  that  monetary  policy  neither  can  nor
should aim to counter fully. If the Riksbank attempts to counter such price movements, the
result  might  be  unnecessarily  costly  for  the  economy,  that  is,  exaggerated  fluctuations  in
economic activity as well as in the financial markets. It was against this background that the
new  Executive  Board  of  the  Riksbank  clarified  the  inflation  target  earlier  this  spring.  To  a
large extent, the clarification tallies with how monetary period has actually been conducted in
the period that the Standing Committee is now appraising.
I  therefore  conclude  that  when  inflation  is  measured  with  the  CPI,  deviations  from  the
inflation target, upwards as well as downwards, in certain periods are something to which we
unfortunately will have to grow accustomed. As a target variable, however, the CPI has many
advantages, including being familiar and covering a large assortment of goods and services.
Deviations from the target may sometimes even be desirable and actually benefit real factors,
such  as  production  and  employment,  as  well  as  financial  market  stability.  This  conclusion
does of course presuppose that people in general expect that in the medium term inflation will
be in line with the target.
Inflation in 1996, 1997 and 1998
I now want to look in more detail at the path of inflation in the three years 1996, 1997 and
1998.  In  the  period  as  a  whole,  the  annual  rate  of  price  increases,  measured  with  the  CPI,
averaged 0.7 per cent. As I just mentioned, however, in each of these years CPI inflation was
markedly  affected  by  shocks  that  are  fairly  easy  to  identify  and  only  have  transitory  direct
effects on inflation.
Lower interest rates
In the course of these years the Riksbank lowered the repo rate from 8.91 to 3.4 per cent, or by
more  than  5.5  percentage  points.  The  five-year  T-bond  rate  moved  down  from  about  8  per
cent to just over 3.8 per cent, or by 4.2 percentage points. Falling interest rates can stimulate
economic  activity  and  thereby  lead  in  time  to  higher  inflation  as  the  level  of  resource

utilisation rises. In the short run, however, the effect on inflation, measured with the CPI, is
downwards as a result of lower house mortgage interest payments. So although inflation may
ultimately  rise  as  a  consequence  of  lower  interest  rates,  the  initial  effect  is  the  opposite.  In
these  years,  moreover,  the  effect  on  interest  expenditure  was  substantial  in  that  inflation
expectations dropped from high levels as the low inflation regime gradually gained credibility.
The downward effect of the lower interest rates on the CPI actually averaged as much as 0.7
percentage points a year.
Altered indirect taxes and subsidies
In this period there were also fairly large changes in indirect taxes. In the longer run this can
influence inflationary pressure via fiscal policy’s impact on demand but there are also more
direct effects. In 1996 changes in indirect taxes had a downward effect on CPI inflation of 0.6
percentage points, followed in 1997 by an average upward effect of 0.5 percentage points. In
1998 as a whole the impact of altered indirect taxes was marginal; after the summer, however,
various measures, including the reduction of tobacco tax, lowered the rate of CPI inflation by
0.5 percentage points.
Falling commodity prices
The development of commodity prices has likewise affected the rate of inflation in the past
three calendar years. The international economic slowdown meant that in the course of 1998
international  commodity  prices  began  to  fall  relatively  sharply.  It  can  be  mentioned,  for
example, that towards the end of 1998 just the lower prices for coffee, petrol and domestic
heating oil had a downward effect on Swedish CPI inflation of 0.4 percentage points. As in
the case of changes in taxes and interest rates, there are distinct direct effects that may deviate
from the more long-term impact on demand.

One  approach  to  a  more  detailed  separation  of  trend  or  core  inflation  from  these  types  of
transitory price effects involves looking at the various indicators of underlying inflation that
have  been  developed  at  the  Riksbank.  Whereas  annual  CPI  inflation  in  the  period  1996–98
averaged 0.7 per cent, inflation as measured by UND1X, which excludes interest expenditure,
taxes and subsidies, averaged 1.5 per cent. As measured by UNDINHX, which also excludes
goods that are mainly imported, inflation amounted instead to 2.1 per cent. However, the latter
indicator disregards a large proportion of the factors that contribute to a weaker price trend for
goods in the longer run.
6. Conclusions about inflation 1996-98
n Inflation - measured with the CPI - was below the target and the lower
tolerance limit during 1996-1998
n CPI-inflation has been markedly affected in all three years by
transitory effects that are easy to identify
n Excluding more transitory price effects, inflation has been inside the
stipulated tolerance interval
This  review  shows  that  in  all  three  years  (1996–98)  inflation  has  been  below  the  target
expressed in terms of the CPI. However, excluding more transitory price effects that monetary
policy  neither  can  nor  should  try  to  counter  in  full,  inflation  has  been  inside  the  stipulated
tolerance interval. I shall be returning to the reasons why price effects of this type should be
disregarded in an appraisal of the Riksbank’s monetary policy.
Permanent and transitory inflation – a schematic account1
Let  us  now  use  some  simplified  examples  to  analyse  how  different  transitory  effects  on
inflation  may  arise  and  what  they  may  imply  for  monetary  policy.  Note  that  we  are  now
studying  the  direct  effects  on  inflation  and  disregarding,  at  least  in  the  second  and  third
examples, the indirect influences that act in the longer run.
1
To  illustrate  the  effects  of  the  various  shocks  on  the  picture  of  inflation  as  measured  with  the  various
indexes, rules of thumb have been used in each example. In practice, a monetary policy situation may also
include aspects that prompt the Riksbank to take other effects of its policy measures into account.

Example 1: an economic slowdown
Assume  that  international  economic  activity  suddenly  falters.  This  will  affect  the  economic
situation in Sweden. In this example, given that the repo rate is left unchanged, it is assumed
to lead to the inflation rate two years ahead being 1 per cent instead of 2 per cent.
In this example we assume that the repo rate is reduced by 2 percentage points (in practice the
Riksbank might prefer to proceed in steps because of uncertainties in the forecast but here a
large cut is made immediately). The interest rate reduction counters the economic slowdown
and UND1X inflation returns to the target two years ahead.
A  repo  rate  cut,  however,  lowers  house  mortgage  interest  expenditure  and  this  has  an
immediate and opposite effect on the CPI. The effect is larger and shows up earlier than the
impact  on  inflation  from  the  economic  slowdown.  In  the  short  run,  the  effect  via  interest
expenditure accordingly smothers the effect from economic  activity  and  there  is  therefore  a
sharp  initial  fall  in  CPI  inflation.  In  this  example,  the  falling  interest  rates  are  assumed  to
lower the rate of CPI inflation by 1.2 percentage points in the first year  and  0.4  percentage
points in the second.2 It is only after that, in up to three years time, that both CPI and UND1X
inflation are back on target.
The example shows that in retrospect, the Riksbank will turn out to be below the target for
CPI inflation. This is a consequence of the Riksbank’s ambition to counter the shock from the
international economic slowdown and thereby prevent inflation from falling further ahead. In

The effects are dependent on, for example, how the long-term interest rate is assumed to move when the
repo  rate  is  adjusted.  In  example  1  the  estimates  are  based  on  the  short-  and  long-term  interest  rates
moving to the same extent, which has largely been the case in recent years.

such a situation it is therefore reasonable to base policy on an inflation forecast that excludes
the direct effects on interest expenditure.

Example 2: altered indirect taxes
In this example economic activity is stable and inflation in line with the target. Suddenly a cut
in  indirect  taxes,  for  instance  the  tobacco  tax  or  the  property  tax  on  private  houses,  is
announced and approved. The cut is assumed to have a downward effect on CPI inflation of
0.7 percentage points in the current year. This, however, constitutes a one-off shift in the price
level,  not  an  effect  that  alters  inflation’s  trend.  All  else  equal,  12  months  later  the  rate  of
inflation will shift back up to the earlier level. Note, however,  that  inflation  measured  with
UND1X is not affected; the rate remains stable around 2 per cent throughout the period.
Neither  are  any  monetary  policy  measures  taken  in  this  example,  as  long  as  inflation
expectations do not change. The reason is that by the time a repo rate cut would elicit effects,
the  tax  changes  would  no  longer  be  affecting  the  inflation  rate.  This  is  evident  from  the
absence of any effect on underlying inflation. Initially, moreover, the interest expenditure item
in the CPI would move in the ‘wrong’ direction and lower CPI inflation even more.
If  medium-term  inflation  expectations  were  to  be  influenced,  on  the  other  hand,  monetary
policy action might be called for. An adjustment of expectations in the light of the tax change
has consequences for underlying inflation, so that inflation may be below the target somewhat
further ahead.

Example 3: falling commodity prices
From  the  earlier  examples  it  might  be  supposed  that  UND1X  is  an  index  of  underlying
inflation that would be preferable to the CPI as a basis for the formulation of monetary policy,
so  that  policy  ought  to  be  appraised  strictly  in  relation  to  this  indicator.  However,  even
UND1X may be affected by transitory shocks.
Let us assume that the price of oil suddenly falls and then remains stable at the lower level.
Underlying inflation measured with UND1X will then fall as much as the CPI. UNDINHX, on
the other hand, remains stable around the 2 per cent target. After 12 months, however, the first
two measures of inflation return to 2 per cent. This follows from the assumption of a one-off
shift in the price of oil.
In this example, too, no monetary policy measures are taken as long as inflation expectations
are not adjusted. The reason is the same as in the previous example.
Could the CPI inflation target have been fulfilled?
Would it have been possible, then, for monetary policy to keep the inflation rate at 2 per cent
during these three years? The answer is both yes and no.
Briefly, the problem with adhering to the 2 per cent inflation target, measured with the CPI,
from 1996 to 1998 is as follows:
In the short run, the downward and direct impact on CPI inflation from lower interest rates –
the  interest  expenditure  effect  –  is  appreciably  larger  than  the  upward  tendency  associated
with stronger economic activity: the macroeconomic effect.
BIS Review   61/1999

A situation in which forecast inflation one to two years ahead points to the rate being below
the target poses evident difficulties for monetary policy. In order to bring inflation back into
line with the target further ahead, the Riksbank responds by reducing the repo rate, which has
the effect of  lowering  inflation  still  more  in  the  shorter  run.  The  interest  expenditure  effect
disappears after a couple of years  and  the  macroeconomic  effect  gains  the  upper  hand.  The
opposite applies if the repo rate is raised.
This accordingly indicates that an appraisal of monetary policy must be based on a thorough
analysis of the factors behind the path of inflation, for example by comparing CPI inflation
with other inflation indicators that exclude transitory price effects.
There was, in fact, a theoretical possibility of preventing CPI inflation from being so low in
1996, 1997 and 1998. The Riksbank never even considered it, for obvious reasons. Still, I can
illustrate how the inflation target could have been fulfilled mechanically by avoiding the direct
interest expenditure effect.
If the Riksbank had left the repo rate at 8.91 per cent – its level before the cuts were initiated
early in 1996 – then the direct interest expenditure effect could have been avoided.
Economic  activity  would  have  gradually  weakened,  however,  and  this  would  have  pushed
down the CPI excluding the interest expenditure effect. But that would have taken time and to
begin with the macroeconomic effect would have been rather small.
Sooner or later, however, the macroeconomic effect would have begun to surpass the interest
effect on the CPI. In theory, that could have been prevented by raising the interest rate and
thereby increasing the interest expenditure effect.
Such a strategy could have been implemented for a time but in the end the economy would
have  become  so  sluggish  that  the  macroeconomic  effect  would  still  have  gained  the  upper
hand. The situation would probably have caused the exchange rate to collapse. The marked
depreciation would have led to rising import prices and perhaps CPI inflation would then have
moved back up to the targeted rate.
That is what could have happened, though I want to stress that the scenario is theoretical and
hypothetical.  The  Riksbank  would  have  fulfilled  the  CPI  target  but  at  the  cost  of  marked
instability in interest rates and the exchange rate as well as in the real economy. I find it hard
to believe that such a strategy would have been supported for any length of time by either the
political system or people in general.
In  the  event  of  a  deviation  from  the  inflation  target,  the  Riksbank  has  to  decide  how  soon
monetary policy should bring inflation back to the targeted rate. If this is done too quickly, it
will exact a cost in the form of instability in the real economy and in financial markets. If it
takes too long, on the other hand, inflation will fluctuate markedly, with the risk of a rising
trend or even genuine deflation.
Against this background, early this year the Executive Board elaborated on the inflation target
and  stated  that,  under  certain  specific  circumstances,  the  Riksbank  has  reason  to  be  more
flexible in its interpretation.3 When I presented this to the Standing Committee in more detail

1999.

BIS Review   61/1999
last March, I noted that it amounted essentially to a codification of monetary policy practice in
recent years. That is also what I have described today.
There is another matter I want to take up concerning monetary policy and its result. It has to
do  with  the  outturn  for  1998,  when  the  annual  change  in  the  CPI  was  0.4  per  cent,  while
UND1X  rose  only  1  per  cent  and  in  some  months  was  also  outside  the  lower  band  limit.
Could not an alternative interest rate policy have succeeded in preventing such a low outcome
for underlying inflation?
Monetary policy could obviously have been given a more expansionary turn than was the case
at the end of 1996 and during 1997, in which case UND1X inflation might have been higher
and more in line with the 2 per cent target, quite apart from the interest expenditure effect on
the CPI.
In  this  context  one  can,  of  course,  discuss  the  Riksbank’s  basic  forecasts  of  inflation
excluding  the  transitory  effects  from  interest  expenditure  and  taxes.  The  Riksbank  made  a
forecasting error in failing to foresee the economic slowdown inherent in the Asian crisis and
the ensuing fall in commodity prices. Unfortunately, you might say, we shared this error with
a clear majority of observers. With the long time lag that applies to monetary policy, measures
should  really  have  been  taken  before  the  end  of  1996  or  early  1997,  which  was  before  the
crisis  had  even  arisen.  If  the  commodity  price  fall  does  not  leave  any  traces  in  inflation
expectations, it should not affect policy either.

There have been periods in the last three decades when CPI inflation has deviated from the
indexes of underlying inflation. This happened, for example, in connection with the oil crises
in the 1970s, the fall in oil prices and interest rates in the mid-1980s, the tax reform in the late
1980s and the downward shifts in interest rates in the 1990s.
There is nothing new about this phenomenon, which can thus recur. It has to do with inflation
being determined mainly by factors of three types:
•  long-term inflation expectations
•  the economic situation
•  transitory  factors  and  supply  shocks  such  as  changes  in  indirect  taxes  and  subsidies,
interest expenditure and commodity prices
For monetary policy it seems reasonable to assert that factors of the first two types are most
relevant  because  it  is  mainly  through  them  that  monetary  policy  is  capable  of  influencing
inflation.  Factors  such  as  indirect  taxes  have  effects  on  consumer  prices  that  are  transitory;
they  normally  disappear  after  a  time  unless  long-term  inflation  expectations  have  been
affected.
Conclusion
The CPI is the target variable for monetary policy. Measured with the CPI, inflation is to be 2
per cent in a longer, annual perspective. There are grounds, however, for sometimes departing
from this target. Short-run deviations from the target should not be attributed automatically to
a faulty formulation of monetary policy. This presupposes, however, that clearly identifiable,
transitory price movements are involved that monetary policy neither can nor should aim to
counter. It is therefore important to look at the factors behind the CPI figures when appraising
monetary policy.
