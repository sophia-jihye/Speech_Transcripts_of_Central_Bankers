Mr Bäckström offers some thoughts on
asset prices and their relevance to central banks
Speech given by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Board
of  Directors  and  President  of  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements,  to  the  Swedish  Shareholders
Association and the FöreningsSparbanken on 16 December 1999.
 First a word of thanks for the invitation to this meeting. The question I want to consider this evening is
why stock market values are so high at present in relation to levels in the past. Are share prices being
based on perceptions of the future that are unrealistic? In other words, are they developing a bubble?
The mood that may lead to assets being valued in terms of expectations that are not realistic has been
described by the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve as “irrational exuberance”.
Could  it  be  the  case,  on  the  other  hand,  that  the  high  prices  stem  from  a  perception  of  some
fundamental changes? After all, the future will not necessarily follow the same pattern as the past.
Steep share price rise
Share prices on the Stockholm Stock Exchange have risen strongly in recent years. In the course of
1999 the average level has moved up more than 50%. This autumn, moreover, the rise has accelerated.
So everything points to 1999 being a very prosperous year for those who save in shares.
As  a  matter  of  fact,  since  1982  the  total  real  return  on  shares  (the  inflation-adjusted  price  level
including reinvested dividends) has risen in Sweden at an average annual rate of around 16%. That is
around two and a half times more than the trend rate since 1918. After 1982 the total real return in the
United States has also been appreciably above the trend rate since 1871 (Fig. 1).1

BIS Review 137/1999
The  price-earnings  ratio  for  the  Stockholm  Exchange  is  currently  around  30  according  to
Affärsvärlden. This means that the price of an average share portfolio is equivalent to around thirty
times the annual earnings. The ratio in the United States is even higher, around 35 (Fig. 2).

Although long series for the Stockholm Exchange’s P/E ratio are hard to find, it is hardly controversial
to say that the present level is well above the historical average. The deviation of share prices from the
fundamental  conditions  that  have  applied  historically  is  even  clearer  after  a  look  at  the  path  of

earnings. In the United States the real earnings trend since 1940 has been virtually constant between
2%  and  3%,  while  -  as  I  just  mentioned  -  the  real  return  on  shares  shows  a  trend  break  after  1982
(Fig. 3).2
Are present share prices fundamentally justifiable?
I shall now use a simple model to examine whether the present level of share prices can be justified in
fundamental terms.3 Simplifying somewhat, this model equates the value of a share with the present
value of the future income the share is expected to generate. A valuation in P/E terms accordingly rests
on  the assumptions that  are  made  about these  future  incomes  -  the  future  growth  of  the  company’s
earnings - and the factor by which these incomes are discounted - the stock market’s expected return.
We  can  insert  alternative  values  for  these  assumptions  to  find  the  combinations  that  might  justify
different P/E ratios (Fig. 4). It will be seen that a P/E ratio of 14 can be warranted if the expected real
return is 6% and the real growth of earnings averages 2.5%. These figures are all approximately in line
with the historical trends.

In  order  to  justify  an  upward  shift  in  the  P/E  ratio  from  just  under  15  to  between  30  and  35,  the
expected real return has to be lower and/or expected earnings growth needs to be higher. A P/E ratio at
the current level can be explained if, for example:
2 The picture in Sweden is somewhat different, with signs of a strengthening of the earnings trend in the period 1982-99,
though  this  is  not  visible  in  the  figure.  The  krona’s  depreciation  after  1992  seems  to  have  been  the  main  factor  here.
Earnings per share showed little, if any, improvement from 1982 to 1990. However, cyclical fluctuations and  changes
connected with the krona’s marked depreciation should not be central issues for our discussion here. As the stock market
trend in both the shorter and the longer term has been largely the same in the United States and Sweden and the P/E ratio
in  both  cases  is  between  30  and  35,  there  are  grounds  for  assuming  that  the  earnings  trend  has  also  been  at  least
approximately the same.

See Gordon, M J (1962), The Investment, Financing and Valuation of the Corporation, Homewood (Irwin). The simple
model is written P/E = d/(k-g), where P is the share price, E earnings per share, d the percentage dividend, k the expected
return and g the expected dividend growth.

BIS Review 137/1999
   the expected real return has fallen from 6% to 4%, or
the expected real earnings trend has risen from 2.5% to 4.5% a year, or
a fall in the expected real return from 6% to 5% has been accompanied by an acceleration of
expected earnings growth from 2.5% to 3.5%.
Has the expected stock market return fallen?
Let us begin with the possibility of a lower expected return. Does it seem likely? For a long period the
expected  return,  in  the  United  States  as  well  as  in  Sweden,  has  been  stable  at  around  6%.  So  why
should things have suddenly changed in recent years in a way that dramatically alters conditions for
the long-term valuation of share prices?
Moreover, a lower expected return would mean that the real return on shares is much the same as on
treasury bonds, for example. Why would share investment be perceived as having roughly the same
risk as investment in bonds issued by a sovereign?
But there are, in fact, some reasons why the expected return may have become somewhat lower.
One  is  that  when  central  banks  around  the  world  focus  monetary  policy  on  price  stability,  this  is
expected to result in greater stability in the real economy. From this it follows that corporate earnings
and  consequently  share  prices  should  also  be  more  stable.  Another  factor  that  may  point  to  less
marked  cyclical  fluctuations  in  the  future  is  the  transition  from  manufacturing  to  the  production  of
services, together with the era of information technology. Thus, if the yield from share investment is
more stable in the future than it has been in the past, this might warrant some downward adjustment of
the expected return and thereby lead to a higher valuation.
Another argument is that with more and more people saving in shares for retirement, the investment
horizon  has  been  lengthened.  This  category  of  share  investor  is  less  concerned  about  short-run
fluctuations in share prices and that might justify a somewhat lower expected return.
A third argument is that financial market developments have resulted in decreased transaction costs
and less liquidity risk.
There may be some truth in arguments of this type but it is still difficult to believe that the expected
return has fallen as much as would be needed to justify today’s stock market valuations.
Or is higher earnings growth foreseen?
Let us now look at the importance of earnings growth for share valuations. We noted earlier that to
justify a P/E ratio between 30 and 35, given an unchanged expected return, real earnings growth must
move up from 2.5% to 4.5%. Is it reasonable to suppose that the future earnings trend will be as high
as that?
One way of answering  this  question  is  to  look  at  the  macro  picture and  determine the  trend rate  of
GDP growth that would be commensurate with such a strong increase in corporate earnings. This is
also  pertinent  in  the  context  of  the  current  discussion  about  a  “new  economy”  that  is  perceived  as
being capable of higher productivity growth and thereby an upward shift in potential GDP growth.
A simple growth model shows that in order to justify a P/E ratio between 30 and 35, the growth trend
for total factor productivity would have to move up almost 3 percentage points.4 That in turn implies
4 The feasibility of a higher future increase in corporate earnings can be analysed with a simple model where GDP growth
is determined by the inputs of capital and labour together with the efficiency with which these resources are utilised in
production.  Using  a  simple  Cobb-Douglas  function,  the  rate  of  increase  in  the  return  to  capital  can  be  derived  as
gR=gA+(1-a)(gL-gK),  where  gA,  gL  and  gK  are  the  growth  rates  for  total  factor  productivity,  labour  and  capital,
respectively. The relevant factor in the present context is the return to capital (the flow of income to owners of the capital
stock in relation to the value of the stock) because this should be linked to the growth of corporate earnings. The return to

that the trend rate of GDP growth has to move up from around 2%  to an  annual  rate of  5%  over a
considerable period. Thus, we are talking of a marked upward shift in the growth trend that has not yet
occurred  in  Sweden.  Neither  has  such  high  growth  been  mentioned  in  the  United  States,  except
perhaps for a single year. The discussion there does, however, concern the possibility that the trend or
potential rate of growth has risen. That would then point to some increase in the growth of corporate
earnings in the United States.
Why are asset prices relevant for central banks?
If asset prices and the growth of credit in an economy are based on unrealistic expectations of future
prospects, the result is liable to be a financial bubble. Under normal circumstances, rising asset prices
add  to  the  value  of  collateral  and  thereby  strengthen  the  borrowing  propensity  of  investors  and  the
lending  propensity  of  banks.  An  upward  trend  in  asset  prices  is  therefore  often  accompanied  by  an
expansion of credit. In Sweden, for example, in the five-year period up to the early 1990s, real asset
prices  had  risen  more  than  70%  and  private  sector  debt  relative  to  GDP  had  grown  from  100%  to
150%  (Fig.  5).  Bubbles  burst  sooner  or  later,  with  consequences  for  the  financial  system  and  the
economy in general that may be grave. That is one reason for central banks to take an interest in stock
market trends.
Today, however, the situation in Sweden does not resemble what happened in the second half of the
1980s. Asset prices have certainly risen strongly in recent years but credit has not grown to the same
extent. It seems that, at least to date in the present upswing, Swedish banks and their customers have
taken  a  different  line  on  the  provision  of  credit  and  borrowing.  Everyone  is  hopefully  more
accustomed to a deregulated credit market than was the case in the late 1980s. Still, it is important to
be alert to the future path of asset prices and credit aggregates, as well as to the underlying forces at
work in the Swedish economy.

capital in an economy is dependent on the level of output and how this income is shared between labour and the owners
of capital. To keep things simple, we can assume that the labour and capital shares are constant in the longer run and
concentrate on how the return to capital is affected by changes in total factor productivity (the  overall  efficiency  with
which labour and capital are utilised in production). A higher return to capital should imply a higher rate of increase in
corporate earnings. Conversely, an accelerating growth of corporate earnings should show up as a rising return to capital
at the macro level.

Conclusions
From what I have said this evening it is possible to draw two conclusions that at first sight may seem
to be somewhat contradictory. On the one hand we have noted that stock market values are historically
high and that in the past this has normally been followed by some form of correction. On the other
hand, there may be some  grounds  for  arguing  that  changes  have  occurred in  expected  stock  market
returns and/or the economy’s potential growth rate which could justify a stock market valuation above
the historical level. In the United States there are at least signs that point in this direction. For Sweden,
however, figures at macro level have not yet been discerned that would confirm such a change.
But these two conclusions are not necessarily contradictory. Present stock market prices could mirror a
combination  of  “irrational  exuberance”  and  a  change  in  the  fundamental  picture  of  the  global
economy.  The  impact  of  the  new  information  technology  may  be  leading  to  higher  productivity
growth.  It  is  also  conceivable  that  stock  market  investment  is  now  considered  to  be  somewhat  less
risky than before, in which case the expected return may have become somewhat lower. But the stock
market reaction to these new signs may have been rather hasty. Experience has shown that financial
markets are sometimes liable to overshoot when adjusting upwards or downwards.
My intention today, however, is not to opt for a particular view. I am more interested in initiating a
discussion and would like to take this opportunity of asking the share investors who are present here:
Which conclusion do you find most valid?
An increase of 3 percentage points in the growth of total factor productivity above the long-term trend leads to an upward
shift in the real return to capital from 6.0% initially to 6.2% (1.031x6) after one year, 7.0% (1.035x6) after five years and
8.1% (1.0310x6) after ten years, that is, an increase of about 2 percentage points after ten years.
