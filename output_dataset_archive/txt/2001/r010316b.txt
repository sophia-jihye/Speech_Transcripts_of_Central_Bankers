Linah K Mohohlo: Bank of Botswana Monetary Policy Statement - 2001
Annual monetary  policy statement for the  year  2001 by Linah K Mohohlo,  Governor  of  the  Bank  of
Botswana on 27 February 2001.
Introduction
It is now an established tradition for the Bank of Botswana to publicly issue an annual Monetary Policy
Statement  at  this  time  of  the  year.  This  is  done  with  a  view  to  providing  a  framework  within  which
monetary policy  will be developed  and implemented during the  year, thereby  assisting the public in
making informed investment decisions.
When the 2000 Statement was presented, the Bank was concerned about spiralling inflation that had
begun in 1999. Accordingly, the Bank took strong measures during 1999 and 2000 to slow down the
rate  of  increase  in  private  expenditure,  as  reflected  in  the  rapid  expansion  of  borrowing  from  the
banking system.
In  doing  so,  it  was  the  Bank(cid:146)s  belief  that  the  measures  taken  to  slow  down  the  rate  of  increase  in
expenditure,  particularly  through  borrowing  from  the  banking  system,  would  reduce  the  level  of
inflation  and  dampen  inflationary  expectations.  Furthermore,  when  designing  anti-inflation  policy
measures,  the  Bank  had  to  strike  a  balance  between  the  need  to  contain  inflation  and  to  avoid  an
undesirable  sharp  slowdown  in  economic  growth.  The  fight  against  inflation  was  also  aimed  at  the
need  to  maintain  the  competitiveness  of  Botswana(cid:146)s  exports,  and  to  encourage  domestic  financial
saving by ensuring that deposit interest rates are positive in real terms.
At this time last year, when the 2000 Monetary Policy Statement was presented, there was hope that
inflation  would  decline  during  the  year.  In  the  event,  inflation  rose,  averaging  8.6  percent  in  2000,
compared to 7.8 percent in 1999. The rise in inflation was due to a number of factors - higher inflation
in Botswana(cid:146)s trading partner countries and the sharp increase in international oil prices - which led to
an increase in imported inflation. In fact, higher inflation was a global phenomenon in 2000. Imported
inflationary  pressures  were  exacerbated  by  increases  in  some  domestic  administered  prices.  In
contrast  to  previous  years,  however,  demand-related  inflationary  pressures  declined,  with  reduced
growth  rates  of  both  credit  and  Government  spending.  Nevertheless,  the  rate  of  expansion  in
expenditure was still high.
In the face of rising inflation and concerns about inflationary expectations, monetary policy necessarily
remained tight during the  year, and there was no scope for any reduction in nominal interest rates.
However,  while  the  objective  of  lower  inflation  remained  elusive,  the  Bank  broadly  succeeded  in
maintaining  positive  real  interest  rates  that  were  comparable  with  those  in  major  trading  partner
countries. On the competitiveness front, there were mixed developments during the year. Producers
competing in world markets benefited from the depreciation of the Pula against the US dollar and other
major  currencies,  while  those  competing  with  South  African  products  faced  the  challenge  of  the
appreciation  of  the  Pula  against  the  South  African  rand  as  this  represented  a  deterioration  in  the
competitiveness of Botswana products vis-(cid:224)-vis those of South Africa.
This year, the objective of monetary policy is to substantially reduce inflation from the 2000 average of
8.6 percent. The desired lower inflation is essential if Botswana exporters are to remain competitive.
Moreover, if achieved, lower inflation would permit an eventual reduction in the cost of borrowing.
The desired reduction of inflation will require that the momentum of the expenditure restraint measures
that  were  put  in  place  in  2000,  especially  the  importance  of  dampening  inflationary  expectations,
should  be  sustained  this  year.  In  this  regard,  it  is  essential  that  the  growth  of  credit  to  the  private
sector is contained at sustainable levels. It is also hoped that the restraint in public expenditure that
has been evident in recent years, and was supportive of and complementary to  the anti-inflationary
monetary policy stance, will be maintained in 2001.
Before  outlining  the  Bank(cid:146)s  Monetary  Policy  for  2001,  it  is  important  to  briefly  review  economic
performance and monetary policy operations in  2000, as  background to this  year(cid:146)s monetary  policy
stance.

Botswana(cid:146)s economic and financial performance in 2000
Economic Performance
The year 2000 was good for economic growth internationally, with the rate of expansion in the world
economy  rising  from  3.4  percent  in  1999  to  an  estimated  4.7  percent  in  2000.  Faster  growth  was
experienced in all regions of the world.
Botswana(cid:146)s rate of economic growth rebounded to  7.7 percent  in  1999/2000,  after  a  relatively  slow
growth  of  4.1  percent  in  1998/99.  The  recovery  was  mostly  due  to  a  sharp  increase  in  diamond
production with the coming on stream of the Orapa 2000 project. As a result, mining output rose by
11.9 percent over the previous year and this resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange reserves
by 17 percent to P33.9 billion (USD6.3 billion) in December 2000, which was equivalent to 34 months
of imports of goods and services. The non-mining sector, however, did less well, with growth slowing
down  from  7.8  percent  to  5.7  percent.  The  manufacturing,  construction  and  agriculture  sub-sectors
experienced particularly sharp declines in their growth rates. Nevertheless, Botswana(cid:146)s overall growth
performance was rapid by international standards.
Monetary and Credit Developments
There were welcome developments in the growth rates of money and credit during 2000.
All the key measures of money supply (M1, M2, M3 and M4) grew at sustainable rates during the year
compared to 1999.
Moreover, the rate of increase in total commercial bank lending steadily declined during the year; it
was 17.6 percent in the year to December 2000, compared to 41.4 percent at the end of 1999. This
welcome reduction in credit growth was mainly in response to the increase  in  lending  interest rates
resulting from monetary policy actions. Credit  to  the household sector rose by 20 percent in 2000,
down from 45 percent in December 1999, while credit to the business sector grew by 14 percent in
2000, compared to 41 percent in 1999. Despite the considerable reduction in credit growth, the overall
rate of increase in bank lending was still in excess of the desired rate.
Fiscal Developments
The Monetary Policy Statement for 2000 anticipated a continued slowdown in Government spending.
In the event, Government expenditure during the calendar year 2000 was only 4.9 percent higher than
in  1999.  Generally,  therefore,  the  thrust  of  fiscal  policy  has  been  in  the  desired  direction.  Revised
estimates for the 2000/2001 fiscal year, which were presented in the 2001/2002 Budget, indicate that
year-on-year expenditure growth is projected at 14 percent, compared to 15 percent in the previous
year.
Nominal and Real Exchange Rates
Nominal  exchange  rates  showed  considerable  volatility  during  2000.  The  South  African  rand
depreciated by 19 percent against the US dollar and by 12 percent against the Euro. The extent of this
depreciation was much greater than expected at the beginning of the year, and appears to be due to a
variety of factors, including adverse political developments in parts of the region and concerns about
the performance of the capital account of South Africa(cid:146)s balance of payments. It was in this context
that the Pula depreciated by 14 percent against the US dollar and 6 percent against the Euro during
the year, while appreciating by 6 percent against the South African rand.
In  real  terms  (when  relative  inflation  with  trading  partner  countries  is  taken  into  account),  the  Pula
appreciated by 6.2 percent against the South African rand. However, higher inflation in Botswana than
in  the  USA  was  more  than  offset  by  nominal  exchange  rate  depreciation.  As  a  result,  the  Pula
depreciated in real terms by 9.2 percent against the US dollar and 0.8 percent against the Euro.

Inflation
The consumer price index data for the period January 1999 to August 2000 were revised during the
year1. As a result, average inflation for 1999 was 7.8 percent, which was higher than was previously
the case. On the basis of the revised price series, inflation accelerated in 2000 to an average of 8.6
percent, with a peak of 10.6 percent in July 2000.
Higher inflation was driven by prices of imports in the main, especially by the rise in oil prices, which
led to a 23 percent increase in the cost of fuel and power and a 15 percent increase in the cost of
transport. The impact of higher world oil prices was worsened by the sharp depreciation of the Pula
against the US dollar during the year. The rise in the cost of imports accelerated from 7.9 percent at
the end of 1999 to 8.8 percent in December 2000. Inflation in South Africa2, Botswana(cid:146)s main source
of imports, rose from 7.9 percent in 1999 to 8.3 percent in 2000.
Domestic  inflation  was  also  driven  by  a  15.5  percent  increase  in  housing  costs,  due  largely  to  an
increase  in  rentals  charged  by  the  Botswana  Housing  Corporation.  However,  food  prices,  which
comprise  the  largest  component  of  the  consumer  price  basket  of  goods,  rose  by  only  4.1  percent,
compared to an increase of 5.3 percent in 1999. Prices of domestically produced goods rose by 6.3
percent in 2000, compared to 6.7 percent in 1999, while prices of non-tradeables rose by 9.9 percent,
against 12 percent in 1999. The reduction in the domestic component of inflation was consistent with
the  slowdown  in  domestic  expenditure  due  to  the  decline  in  growth  rates  of  both  credit  and
Government spending.
Monetary Policy Implementation in 2000
In  view  of  rising  inflation  and  the  undesirably  high  rate  of  credit  growth,  monetary  policy  remained
restrictive throughout the year. The Bank Rate was raised twice, by 50 basis points each time, from
13.25  percent  to  13.75  percent  in  February  2000,  and  to  14.25  percent  in  October  2000.
Correspondingly,  commercial  banks  increased  their  lending  and  deposit  interest  rates,  although
deposit  interest  rates  were  increased  by  smaller  margins  than  lending  interest  rates.  Apart  from
increases in the Bank Rate, the Bank continued to manage the liquidity of the banking system through
open market operations, supplemented by the use of repurchase agreements and the secured lending
facility.
The combined effect of the deployment of monetary policy tools was that the yield on 3-month Bank of
Botswana Certificates (BoBCs) rose from 12.0 percent at the end of 1999 to 12.7 percent at the end of
2000, and excess liquidity of the banking system declined by 4.8 percent in 2000,3 contrasting with an
increase  of  20.7  percent  in  1999.  Real  interest  rates  on  3-month  BoBCs  rose  from  3.3  percent  in
December  1999  to  3.7  percent  in  December  2000.  The  rates  were  higher  than  comparable  real
interest  rates  in  South  Africa,  the  USA  and  the  UK,  which  were  3.0  percent,  2.5  percent  and  2.7
percent, respectively.
Despite  the  increase  in  inflation  during  2000,  it  should  not  be  concluded  that  monetary  policy  was
unsuccessful.  The  growth  rate  of  credit,  the  Bank(cid:146)s  key  intermediate  target  variable,  was  sharply
reduced;  and  when  combined  with  reduced  growth  in  Government  spending,  this  indicated  that
domestic demand pressures on inflation were on a downward trend. The rise in headline inflation was
largely  due  to  supply-side  cost  pressures,  including  international  oil  prices,  exchange  rate  changes
against  major  international  currencies  and  domestic  rentals,  all  of  which  are  largely  outside  the
influence of monetary policy.
                                                     
1  The revisions were backdated to 1999 due to the fact that the increase in Botswana Housing Corporation rentals, effected in
1999, had not been factored into the consumer price index for that year.
2 Reference to South African inflation is to core inflation (i.e. the change in the overall consumer price index excluding prices
of certain food products, interest rates on mortgage bonds, overdrafts and personal loans, value-added tax  and  property
taxes) unless otherwise stated.

Economic and financial prospects for 2001
Economic Prospects
Expectations are that global economic activity will slow down in 2001 compared to 2000, particularly in
the USA, where it appears the economic boom that lasted for most of the 1990s has finally come to an
end. The anticipated slowdown in the world(cid:146)s largest economy, USA, will have an impact on the rest of
the world economy.
Despite  the  projected  slowdown  in  world  economic  growth,  the  Botswana  economy  is  forecast  to
maintain  a reasonably  high rate of growth of around  8-9  percent  in  2000/2001.  This  will  be  due,  in
large  part,  to  the  full  impact  of  the  Orapa  Mine  expansion  on  mining  sector  output,  combined  with
some  recovery  in  the  non-mining  sector,  especially  in  manufacturing,  transport  and  construction.
However, following completion of the Orapa Mine expansion, there is likely to be a deceleration in the
rate of growth.
Inflation Outlook in 2001
While inflation rose worldwide in 2000 in response to higher energy prices, it is forecast to decline in
2001  in  most  advanced  economies.  The  expectation  of  lower  inflation  reflects  forecasts  of  lower
economic growth for the global economy, a factor which would  weaken demand. Moreover, despite
uncertainties with regard to the volumes of supply, oil prices are anticipated to decline from current
levels. For major industrial countries, inflation is forecast to decline from 2.5 percent at the end of 2000
to 1.9 percent in 2001. In South Africa, it is expected that monetary policy restraint will continue and
this, together with the anticipated fall in oil prices, is expected to reduce core inflation to 7.5 percent or
below.
Monetary policy for 2001
Domestically, there remains a pressing need to bring down inflation. While the ultimate objective is to
achieve  a  level  of  inflation  that  would  be  comparable  with  that  of  industrialised  economies,  a  more
immediate objective should, at least, be to achieve inflation that is no higher than that of developing
countries as a whole.
While this objective is ambitious, it is achievable. The external environment is benign, in view of the
expected decline in global inflation and the likelihood that average oil prices will be lower in 2001 than
in 2000. It is also likely that imported inflationary pressures from South Africa will be partially offset by
the impact of the appreciation of the Pula against the South African rand that has already taken place
but is yet to feed through to Botswana inflation.
Even  with  favourable  prospects  with  respect  to  external  inflationary  developments,  achieving  lower
inflation will depend on containing and reducing domestic inflationary pressures. It will, therefore, be
necessary to continue the trend of slower domestic public and private expenditure growth that began
in 2000. The desired reduction in inflation implies a further decline in credit growth during 2001, from
17.6 percent registered at the end of 2000. A lower rate of credit expansion will still accommodate the
need to finance the real growth of the non-mining sector, and foster a successful diversification of the
economy.  This  effort  needs  to  be  complemented  by  continued  restraint  in  the  growth  of  public
expenditure to below the rate of 14 percent estimated for the 2000/2001 fiscal year.
A  substantial  balance  of  payments  surplus  is  projected  for  2001,  as  a  result  of  which  the  foreign
exchange reserves should continue to grow and add liquidity to the banking system. This situation will
be  compounded  by  the  projected  2001/2002  Government  budget  deficit.  Therefore,  the  Bank  will
continue to manage interest rates and liquidity in the financial sector in a manner consistent with the
objective of reigning in inflation. Liquidity management will continue to rely on open market operations
using Bank of Botswana Certificates. The task will also be facilitated by measures aimed at improving
the functioning and efficacy of the money market.
Conclusion
Internationally,  there  are  prospects  of  lower  economic  growth  and  reduced  inflation  which  have
already given rise to cuts in interest rates in major industrialised economies, led by the USA with the
two 50 basis point reductions in January 2001. However, domestically, the economy will expand at a
4
BIS Review 21/2001
relatively  high  rate  in  2001/2002.  When  economic  expansion  is  high,  there  is  always  a  risk  of
expenditure  growth  rising  at  unsustainable  rates  that  lead  to  inflationary  developments.  Therefore,
even  though  the  Bank  is  sensitive  to  the  need  to  ease  monetary  policy,  it  is  essential  that  any
reduction in interest rates should not be premature.
As pointed out in past years(cid:146) Monetary Policy Statements, the main objectives of Botswana(cid:146)s monetary
policy are to achieve price stability and to maintain positive real interest rates at comparable levels to
those  of  major  international  financial  markets.  It  goes  without  saying,  therefore,  that  when
macroeconomic  conditions  are  right,  the  Bank  will  be  in  a  position  to  reduce  interest  rates.  In  this
respect,  the  substantial  decline  in  credit  growth  in  the  course  of  2000  is  a  positive  development.
However,  the  opportunity  for  reducing  interest  rates  will  only  be  presented  when  there  is  clear
evidence  that  overall  domestic  expenditure  trends  are  appropriate,  and  inflation  is  on  a  definite
downward trend.
