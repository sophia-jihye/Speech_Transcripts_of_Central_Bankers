 I J Macfarlane: Relative advance or relative decline? 
Talk  by  Mr  I  J  Macfarlane,  Governor  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Australia,  to  The  Economist  Group’s 
7th Foreign Investor Roundtable with the Government of Australia, Canberra, 25 June 2002. 
 I would like to start by thanking The Economist Group for inviting me to be the guest speaker at the 7th 
Roundtable. These Roundtables have served a very useful purpose since their inception in the late 
1960s, and I am sure this one will be just as productive. When I was invited to give this address, I was 
told that it would be part of a session entitled “Australia in 2020: strikingly similar, significantly different, 
or  in  relative  decline”.  From  this,  I  assumed  that  I  was  required  to  speak  on  medium-term  issues, 
which  I  am  always  very  happy  to  do.  But  since  I  have  a  couple  of  difficulties  with  the  session  title 
above, I may not stick to the script expected of me. 
My first difficulty is that I am wary of forecasts going out as far as 2020. These have a tendency to be 
not much more than projections of current short-term trends and can be quite misleading; this was the 
case  with  those  produced  by  the  Club  of  Rome  in  the  seventies  showing  the  world  running  out  of 
commodities, and those made in the eighties showing the level of GDP in Japan exceeding that of the 
United States. My other difficulty is with the inclusion of the phrase “relative decline” as a possibility, 
without specifically mentioning the possibility of “relative advance”. This may be nothing more than a 
“Freudian slip”, but nevertheless, I will use it as the theme for my talk tonight. 
It  is  a  theme  I  have  touched  on  before  -  the  tendency  for  Australians  to  be  pessimistic  about  their 
economic future. The reasons for this pessimism have varied from decade to decade, and there have 
been a few new ones added in recent years, but the overall tone seems to be relatively constant, and 
relatively impervious to changes in our actual economic condition. I would have thought that, after a 
decade in which our growth performance has been the best in the OECD area (with a couple of minor 
exceptions),1 most of the pessimism should have receded, but I doubt that it has. In order to assist in 
this process, I would like to recall some facts before moving on to discuss the arguments. 
I have already mentioned our growth performance in the past decade. The actual numbers are shown 
in Table 1, which uses calendar year 1990 as the base and shows the average growth rate up to the 
most recent quarter (March quarter 2002). Note that by using 1990 as the base, we include the early 
nineties recession for all countries in the average, as well as the later expansion.

Part of our stronger growth can be explained by faster population growth, but we also have put in an 
excellent productivity performance over the decade as well. In the work done by the Federal Reserve 
Board in the United States2 and by the OECD in Paris,3 Australia is identified as one of the group of 
countries that has increased its rate of productivity growth (whether measured by labour or multi-factor 
productivity) in the nineties compared with the eighties. Chart 1, which is reproduced from the OECD, 
shows Australia is second only to Finland in its acceleration in multi-factor productivity. 
The trends I have mentioned are not confined to the 1990s, although that was clearly our best decade 
in terms of relative advance. If we look at the broader picture over the past 20 years, Australia is still in 
the  very  small  group  of  advanced  countries  to  have  increased  its  share  of  world  output.  Using  the 
IMF’s  annual  database4,  it  is  possible  to  discern  some  interesting  longer-term  trends  from 
developments over the past 20 years. This is a useful exercise because it is an antidote to the type of 
thinking which concentrates on very recent developments, some of which I will cover later.

   The two main trends that are of relevance for tonight’s topic are as follows: 
(1) 
Our region - which is mainly the developing countries of Asia - has grown a lot quicker than 
the world as a whole and so its share of world output has risen from 10½ per cent in 1980 to 
24 per cent in 2001. Not only has the total risen, but each country, with the exception of the 
Philippines,  has  been  able  to  increase  its  share  of  world  output  (Table  2).  It  is  worth 
reminding ourselves of this major trend, because it tends to be overshadowed by our more 
recent memory of the Asian crisis of 1997 and 1998.

In  contrast,  the  developed  countries  of  the  OECD  area  have  grown  less  rapidly  than  the 
world  average  and  their  share  of  world  output  has  fallen  from  57.5  per  cent  in  1980  to 
52.4 per cent in 2001. Within the group of developed countries, only three have managed to 
increase their share of world output - the United States, Australia and Ireland. If we leave out 
BIS Review 41/2002

 Ireland because of its small size and its exceptional circumstances, Australia and the United 
States are the only two developed countries of reasonable size and reasonable initial income 
per  head  to  have  increased  their  share  of  world  output.  Some  people  would  discount  our 
achievement  by  pointing  out  that  a  fair  bit  of  our  increase  in  share  was  due  to  higher 
population growth resulting from higher levels of immigration. But that should be seen as a 
strength rather than a weakness if we are interested in which areas are growing and which 
are declining in relative importance. Also, it points to favourable developments in the future, 
as  high-immigration  countries  are  less  susceptible  to  the  strains  imposed  by  an  aging 
population.

I have presented enough statistics for the time being. The purpose of highlighting these 20-year trends 
was not to imply that they must continue - they may not. My purpose was to ask the question “given 
this has happened over the past 20 years, why would you start with the presumption for Australia of 
relative  decline  -  why  wouldn’t  you  start  from  the  expectation  of  relative  advance?”  Another  way  of 
viewing these statistics is to observe that, while there may have been some influences running against 
us, they have obviously been outweighed by influences acting in our favour. 
What are these influences that are generally cited as acting against our long-term interests? I will start 
with the familiar, then move on to some of the more recently-cited ones. 
The  time-honoured  reason  for  pessimism  was  the  belief  that  there  would  be  an  inevitable  long-run 
decline in Australia’s terms of trade, i.e. that our export prices would stagnate, while our import prices 
would rise inexorably. This was tied up with the general lament that we had too small a manufacturing 
base,  and  were too dependent on “commodities” produced  by  the rural  and resource sector. There 
4 
 BIS Review 41/2002
 certainly was a lot of substance to this argument until recently, so I do not wish to belittle it, or declare 
it dead prematurely. But events over the past two decades or so have cast a lot of doubt on its future 
applicability. For example: 
(a) 
Australia’s terms of trade bottomed in 1986 and have risen since. It has not been an even 
rise, but each subsequent trough has been at a higher level than its predecessor. The main 
reason for this is not that export prices have been particularly buoyant, but that import prices, 
predominantly manufactures, have been weaker. 
This should come as no surprise since the nature of the world’s manufacturing sector has 
undergone an enormous transformation over the past two decades. In 1980, only 25 per cent 
of the world’s manufactured exports came from developing countries: by 2000, 80 per cent 
did so.5 There has been a role reversal, and this has been accompanied by a loss of pricing 
power  by  exporters  of  manufactures  that  has  effectively  shifted  real  income  to  importing 
countries.  It  is  hard  to  see  how  this  process  could  not  continue,  with  China  and  India  still 
having so much capacity for further expansion. 
(b) 
The  more  recent  sources  of  pessimism  are  of  a  very  different  nature,  and  very  hard  to  analyse  in 
simple economic terms. Let me start with a frequently-heard complaint in financial markets, and work 
from there. The complaint is summarised by the phrase “we (meaning Australia) are just not on the 
radar screen”. By this is meant the tendency for investors around the world to concentrate their efforts 
in the big markets, such as the United States and Europe, and to ignore us because of our small size 
and lack of strategic importance. There is no doubt that this tendency can be important at times, but 
we  should  not  assume  that  it  is  permanent.  Recently,  we  suffered  from  its  effects,  but  there  is  no 
reason why it should continue, and it has not continued. Chart 2 on recent international capital flows 
into and out of Australia tells an interesting story. 
First, it is certainly true that inward portfolio investment into Australian equities dried up for a time in 
2000 and early 2001. This was consistent with the “we are off the radar screen” explanation, which 
itself was part of the international investment community’s infatuation with the “new economy” and its 
disdain for the rest, including us. But the important thing is that it seems to be a phase that has passed 
into history with the rest of the “tech bubble” - inward portfolio investment has resumed again in recent 
quarters. Incidentally, inward direct investment continued at a relatively steady pace over recent years, 
and was largely unaffected by the tendency described above. 
In the past, it was inward direct investment that attracted unfavourable comment. Foreign investment 
and multinational corporations were viewed with suspicion and accused of buying our best companies 
(in  some  sense,  the  opposite  of  the  “we  are  off  the  radar  screen”  argument).  Now  the  interesting 
tendency is in the opposite direction - Australian direct investment abroad is greater than foreign direct 
investment in Australia. Also, Australian portfolio investment abroad has risen strongly. What does this 
mean? Does it support another often-heard view that there are no good investment opportunities in 
Australia, and firms and investors are forced to go abroad? 
The first thing to note is that Australia is still an overall net importer of capital, i.e. more is invested in 
and lent to Australia from abroad than we lend to or invest in other countries (a necessary corollary of 
running a current account deficit). Since the Government has little or no role in these investment flows, 
it is the world and Australia’s private sector players that have chosen this outcome. 
Notwithstanding  this  consideration,  some  people  are  still  troubled  by  the  amount  of  portfolio 
investment abroad by Australian institutions and direct investment abroad by  Australian companies, 
accusing them of turning their backs on Australia. I think the situation is a bit better than this. My guess 
is  that  the  bulk  of  the  portfolio  investment  abroad  is  just  a  sensible  diversification  of  assets  by 
Australian  investors  and  institutions.  In  1983,  before  exchange  controls  were  abolished,  Australian 
portfolios had zero international diversification, and in time we will reach a level that is appropriate to 
our circumstances. In the meantime, we will see outflows as we move from zero to the optimal level. In 
addition,  we  should  not  forget  that  other  countries  are  also  diversifying  their  portfolios,  and  in  the 
process purchasing Australian equities and bonds.

On  direct  investment,  we  are  going  through  the  second  phase  of  Australian  companies  buying 
overseas assets. In the first phase in the late eighties, it was done rather indiscriminately with a lot of 
investment  outside  the  investor’s  normal  area  of  expertise.  The  results  were  not  very  good.  More 
recently, however, most of it has been done by successful Australian firms that have reached their limit 
of expansion in their own industry locally, but are good enough to compete in other markets in their 
area  of  expertise.  Thus,  we  have  seen  them  expanding  directly  into  overseas  markets  in  transport, 
packaging, building supplies, shopping malls, property services, etc., mainly activities that cannot be 
serviced via exports, but require direct investment. I think this trend is to be applauded, and is a sign of 
the success of Australian business rather than its inadequacy. Although we are nowhere near as far 
down  this  path  as,  say,  the  Netherlands  or  Switzerland,  their  success  shows  that  it  is  not  only  the 
major countries that can create viable international companies. 
So  far,  I  have  not  mentioned  the  other  catchphrase  -  the  “branch  economy”  -  the  belief  that  the 
companies in the peripheral countries will be swallowed up by larger companies centred mainly in the 
United States (and, to a lesser extent, Europe), leaving only branch operations behind. This is a more 
difficult concept to  pin down, although I do not  wish to dismiss it as a concern. There certainly are 
powerful forces towards centralisation that operate within economies, and between economies. These 
centripetal  forces  are  primarily  the  result  of  improved  technology,  particularly  in  communications, 
media and transport. They are best analysed within the framework of “winner-take-all markets”6 rather 
than in the more conventional discussion on globalisation. 
If this is our concern, i.e. our best companies are falling into foreign hands, the thing we should mainly 
worry about would be a big rise in inward direct investment, but we have not seen this - we have seen

 BIS Review 41/2002
 a  reasonably  steady  trend  over  recent  years.  Again,  if  this  is  our  concern,  we  should  applaud  the 
success of Australian companies operating abroad, as shown by the recent strength of outward direct 
investment - although there will inevitably be tensions about where these companies will be listed and 
headquartered. 
It  will  take  a  long  time  before  we  can  put  these  issues  into  perspective.  We  are  still  too  heavily 
influenced  by  the  events  of  recent  years  whereby  everyone  seemed  to  be  comparing  themselves 
unfavourably  against  the  US  economy,  and  finding  that  they  were  losing  out  in  the  investment 
community’s  esteem. That  situation  is  changing  and,  when  the  dust  settles,  I  suppose  some  of  the 
more  extreme  views  about  the  magnetic  pull  of  investment  to  the  United  States  will  recede.  As 
explained, we have already seen this happening in the Australian figures on foreign investment and it 
is  also  showing  up  elsewhere,  including  in  the  US  figures  on  capital  movements,  where  net  capital 
movements have returned to outflows after a few years of heavy inflows. 
 
 
This  is  the  note  on  which  I  think  I  should  finish. We  cannot  predict  the  future:  all  we  can  do  as  a 
country is to try and make sure that we have an economy that is resilient enough to handle the shocks 
that  it  will  inevitably  face.  We  have  done  so  successfully  twice  in  recent  years  when  we  faced  the 
Asian crisis of 1997/98 and the world recession of 2001. This should give us some confidence that we 
can handle the next one - whatever it is - as successfully.
