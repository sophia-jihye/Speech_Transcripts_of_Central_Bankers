 Introduction 
1. 
There  is  presently  little  disagreement  among  economists  that  the  ultimate  goal  of  monetary  policy 
should be price stability. Indeed, in the statute of the recently established European Central Bank price 
stability is clearly stated as the primary objective of the bank, and it is made clear that support of the 
general economic policies in the Community is only a secondary objective. 
In  pursuing  the  final  target  of  price  stability,  different  countries  have  chosen  different  intermediate 
targets to guide their monetary  policy. During the  last decade several countries have switched  to  a 
monetary regime based on inflation targeting.2,3 Since monetary policy is only effective with some lag, 
and since excessive output losses are to be avoided, inflation-targeting central banks seek to control 
inflation  over  the  medium  term.  Expected  future  inflation  at  a  given  horizon  thus  serves  as  the 
intermediate target for an inflation-targeting central bank. 
This  article  will,  however,  focus  on  another  intermediate  target:  the  exchange  rate.4  Before  the 
creation of the European Monetary Union, most of the EU member states participated in the European 
Monetary  System  –  a  fixed-exchange-rate  system  based  on  a  grid  of  bilateral  central  parities  and 
intervention bands. Currently, three EU member states have not adopted the euro: while the UK and 
Sweden  have  inflation-targeting  regimes  and  a  floating  exchange  rate  vis-à-vis  the  euro,  Denmark 
follows a fixed-exchange-rate policy vis-à-vis the euro. The intermediate target for Danish monetary 
policy is thus the krone/euro exchange rate. 
The new European fixed-exchange-rate system, ERM II, came into operation on 1 January 1999 and 
Denmark became a member immediately, with a narrow fluctuation band of +/- 2.25 per cent around a 
central  parity  of  746.038  kroner  per  100  euro.  The  favourable  convergence  position  of  the  Danish 
economy made it possible to conclude an agreement on a narrow band. The standard fluctuation band 
in ERM II is +/- 15 per cent. 
Membership of ERM II was not a major change of the Danish monetary regime. As a matter of fact, 
Denmark has a very long tradition for a fixed-exchange-rate policy. The central parity vis-à-vis the euro 
corresponds exactly to the former central rate vis-à-vis the D-mark, which was unchanged from early 
1987, cf. Chart 1. Furthermore, by 1982, exchange-rate realignments had ceased to be a self-initiated 
Danish policy instrument. 
The  firm  commitment  to  a  fixed-exchange-rate  policy  originates  from  very  poor  performance  of 
macroeconomic  policy  and,  consequently,  poor  performance  of  the  Danish  economy  in  the  1970s. 
Against the background of high inflation, excessive budget deficits, permanent deficits on the current 
account  of  the  balance  of  payments,  frequent  devaluations  of  the  krone  and  high  nominal  interest 
rates,  the  Danish  authorities  in  the  early  1980s  made  a  successful  U-turn  to  a  stability-oriented 
macroeconomic regime. The fixed-exchange-rate policy was, and still is, an important element in the 
macroeconomic framework in Denmark. See Christensen and Topp (1997) for a more detailed review 
of the change in Danish economic policy in the aforementioned period.

4   Some central banks, most notably the Bundesbank and the Swiss National Bank, have pursued monetary targets in the 
past. However, Bernanke et al. (1999) argue that they were implicitly targeting inflation.

 While participation in ERM I and ERM II have been beneficial to the Danish economy in its own right, 
these exchange-rate systems and the successful introduction of the euro should be viewed in a much 
broader context than from a purely monetary policy perspective. EU member states co-operate on a 
large  range  of  political  and  economic  issues  and  have  set  up  a  common  legal  and  institutional 
framework, of which the ECB is only one example. This probably contributed to a smooth transition to 
a common monetary policy.

The  paper  is  organised  as  follows.  The  first  part  covers  the  structural  macroeconomic  facts  of 
importance for the fixed-exchange-rate policy. The second part deals with the technical and tactical 
aspects  of  monetary-policy  implementation  in  ERM  II.  The  paper  concludes  that  a  fixed  nominal 
exchange rate vis-à-vis the euro is beneficial for a small open economy such as Denmark. 
The Danish fixed-exchange-rate Policy 
2. 
It is important to emphasise that the Danish exchange-rate policy is a fixed-exchange-rate policy, and 
not  a  fixed,  but  adjustable,  exchange  rate.  Taken  literally,  this  can  only  be  true  with  euro  area 
membership.  However,  in  a  Danish  policy  context  it  means  that  all  macroeconomic  policies  are 
conducted with a view to ensuring a fixed exchange rate. There is no contingency plan if things go 
wrong. 
The  two  key  conditions  for  success  are  a  strong  commitment  from  the  authorities  to  abstain  from 
creating “home made” shocks (which according to the Danish experience are far more important than 
exogenous external shocks) and  an  unconditional  willingness to subordinate monetary  policy  to the 
exchange-rate strategy. 
Price stability  
A first test of the benefits of a monetary regime is to see if it delivers on the final goal. For a central 
bank  the  key  issue  is  price  stability,  and  the  Danish  monetary  regime  passes  the  test.  Inflation 
measured  as  the  percentage  annual  increase  in  the  harmonised  consumer  price  index  (HICP)  has 
been stable at around 2 per cent in Denmark since the early 1990s, cf. Chart 2. The persistence of low 
inflation  has  furthermore  been  conducive  to  low  inflationary  expectations.  In  the  period  since  the 
announcement of the fixed-exchange-rate policy low and stable inflation has been achieved  without 
loss of income relative to our major trading partners, Germany, Sweden and the UK, although it should 
be recalled that the transition to a low-inflation economy is not an isolated Danish phenomenon. Most

 OECD countries have achieved the same in the last decade, independently of their monetary-policy 
regimes.  Consequently,  Danish  inflation  performance  cannot  be  taken  as  a  general  proof  of  the 
superiority of a fixed-exchange-rate regime.

A fixed-exchange-rate policy implies that the stance of monetary policy is from time to time out of line 
with  domestic  short-term  cyclical  needs,  and  is  potentially  a  destabilising  factor.  When  key 
monetary-policy interest rates are closely linked to German interest rates, and since 1999 euro-area 
interest rates, there is no room for independent domestic stabilisation by means of monetary policy. 
BIS Review 53/2002

 This  problem  appears  to  be  particularly  severe  in  Denmark,  where  the  business  cycle  –  at  least 
according  to  visual  inspection  –  seems  to  be  negatively  correlated  with  the  cyclical  conditions  in 
Germany and the euro area, cf. Chart 3. However, it is also possible to draw a completely opposite 
conclusion from the deviation in the cyclical patterns: cyclical divergence is immaterial to the success 
of a fixed-exchange-rate policy. 
The  monetary-policy  transmission  mechanism  is  of  crucial  importance  in  the  choice  between 
business-cycle and exchange-rate stabilisation. The direct effect from changes in short-term interest 
rates to domestic demand is comparatively small in Denmark. The terms for mortgage financing, which 
is the most important transmission channel to the household sector, are predominantly based on fixed 
20-year or 30-year mortgage bond  yields. Variable  mortgage lending at 1-5  year interest rates has, 
however, gained in importance in recent years, but is still at a relatively low level.  
The basic textbook model includes only one policy instrument for short-term stabilisation – monetary 
policy.  This  is  a  standard  formulation  in  the  literature  and  also  in  line  with  practice  in  most 
industrialised  countries.  Discretionary  fiscal  policy  came  into  disrespect  after  the  abuse  of  the 
instrument in the 1960s and 1970s, which led to stagflation, large budget deficits and high public debt 
in many countries. Denmark has also suffered from this experience, but discretionary fiscal policy is 
still used to stabilise the economy. It is important to underline that the frequency of discretionary fiscal 
measures  is  low  and  far  below  the  frequency  of  monetary-policy  changes  in  countries  with  other 
monetary regimes. The government does not meet every two weeks to consider an adjustment to e.g. 
the  VAT  rate  following  the  latest  business-cycle  information.  During  the  past  decade  discretionary 
fiscal  stabilisation  measures  outside  the  normal  central-government  budgetary  calendar  have  been 
introduced on three occasions: temporary expansive measures in 1993, and contractive measures in 
1997 and 1998. Furthermore, the appropriate macroeconomic impulse from the government budget to 
output is also taken into consideration in the annual budget negotiations. In years when fiscal policy 
has not been used for stabilisation purposes the fiscal impulse, i.e. the contemporaneous contribution 
to  GDP-growth  from  fiscal  policy  in  a  given  year,  has  been  close  to  zero.  As  is  the  case  in  most 
countries it is also politically easier to increase public expenditure and reduce taxes than the opposite 
in  Denmark.  However,  it  is  not  our  assessment  that  the  reliance  on  a  fixed  exchange  rate  and 
occasional discretionary fiscal policy measures in itself has exacerbated this inherent problem. 
Quite  the  contrary,  the  fixed-exchange-rate  policy  has  been  instrumental  in  the  significant 
improvement  in  Danish  economic  policy  that  has  taken  place  in  the  last  10-15  years.  The  Danish 
government, supported by a large majority in the Danish parliament, is committed to use fiscal policy if 
inflationary developments are out of line with the exchange-rate policy. It has been publicly announced 
that fiscal policy will be adjusted if inflation deviates from the ECB’s definition of price stability (0-2 pct. 
increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices - HICP).  
Fiscal  measures  are  taken  with  due  regard  for  developments  in  government  debt  as  well  as  in  the 
current account. Indeed, except for 1998 Denmark has had a surplus on the current account of the 
balance  of  payments  since  1990,  while  there  has  been  a  surplus  on  the  government  budget  since 
1997.  Furthermore  and  equally  important,  the  fixed-exchange-rate  policy  has  brought  structural 
reforms of the tax and benefit systems and the labour market to the policy forefront as the necessary 
tools to ensure low unemployment and growth in real income.  
Asymmetric shocks, home-made shocks and exchange-rate policy in Denmark  
A  floating  exchange  rate  is  often  considered  useful  in  order  to  insulate  an  economy  from  certain 
shocks  in  a  world  with  nominal  wage  rigidity  and/or  limited  labour  mobility.  A  fixed-exchange-rate 
policy  can  lead  to  excessive  and  protracted  unemployment  in  such  a  world,  and  adjustment  to 
asymmetric  shocks  is  –  at  least  in  theory  –  an  important  argument  against  a  fixed-exchange-rate 
policy. However, the importance of this argument requires answers to the following two questions: 1) 
What causes large positive and large negative output gaps?  2) Is a floating exchange rate an efficient 
shock absorber? 
The Danish economy was in severe slump in 1981, reached a peak in 1986, went back into a period of 
slow growth, bottoming out in 1993, and has grown strongly since and exhausted the negative output 
gap, cf. Chart 3. The business cycle was also out of line with Germany as well as the entire euro area. 
The business cycle in itself and the deviation to the German business cycle cannot be explained by 
exogenous external factors. Firstly, the demand for Danish exports did not deviate from the trend to an 
extent  that  can  explain  the  cyclical  swings  in  the  period  under  observation.  Secondly,  the  terms  of 
trade  moved  more  or  less  in  line  with  the  terms  of  trade  for  other  EU  member  states,  ruling  out 
4 
 BIS Review 53/2002
 external price shocks as an explanation. Hence, the roots of Danish output fluctuations are to be found 
among domestic factors. Accordingly, the analysis does not carry over to an economy subject to large 
external shocks. 
The trough in 1981 had its origin in the very poor macroeconomic policies of the 1970s that can be 
summarised  as  traditional  Keynesian  demand  stimulus  to  the  oil-price  shocks.  The  sharp  fall  in 
nominal  interest  rates  following  the  announcement  of  the  fixed-exchange-rate  policy  in  1982,  in 
combination  with  other  austerity  measures,  was  not  accompanied  by  a  corresponding  immediate 
reduction in inflation expectations. This led to a decline in expected ex-ante after-tax real interest rates 
that triggered a boom in house prices and private consumption, leading to the peak in 1986. The until 
then  highly  preferential  tax  treatment  of  interest-rate  expenditures  was  reduced  as  from  1987.  A 
decline  in  actual  inflation  in  combination  with  the  tax  changes  led  to  a  sharp  increase  in  ex-post 
after-tax  real  interest  rates  that  triggered  the  proceeding  depression  in  the  housing  market  and  a 
strong increase in the private savings ratio. The Danish experience over the last twenty years is thus 
that  “home  made”  domestic  shocks  stemming  from  economic  policy  are  more  important  than 
exogenous external shocks.

The  choice  of  exchange-rate  regime  is  not  a  choice  between  a  fixed  nominal  exchange  rate  and  a 
floating  exchange  rate  that  evolves  according  to  purchasing  power  parity.  A  floating  exchange  rate 
often  moves  relatively  far  away  from  any  reasonable  estimate  of  purchasing  power  parity  and  thus 
acts as a shock creator rather than a shock absorber, cf. Buiter (2000). The strength of the dollar in 
the mid-1980s and the present  weakness of the euro are  well-known examples. The importance of 
such  unwarranted  disturb-ances  is  most  severe  for  small  open  economies  such  as  Denmark.  The 
exchange-rate  movements  depicted  in  Chart  4  and  Chart  5  indicate  that  Sweden  –  a  small  open 
economy with a floating exchange rate and low inflation – receives far more noise from exchange-rate 
fluctuations than Denmark. The fixed-exchange-rate policy cannot ensure a stable nominal effective 
exchange rate or a stable real effective exchange rate. However, the weight to the euro in the effective 
Danish exchange rate is slightly below 60 per cent. Thereby, the fixed-exchange-rate policy yields a 
nominal hedge in a very important market for the Danish economy. This planning stability is beneficial 
to the business climate. A fixed-exchange-rate policy based on the nominal effective exchange rate 
would not offer such a hedge against any specific currency.

In order to achieve exchange-rate stability, the interest rates of Danmarks Nationalbank are adjusted 
in step with those of the ECB, with due consideration of conditions in the foreign-exchange market, cf. 
Chart 7. A tend-ency for the krone to weaken will be met by a widening of the interest-rate differential, 
and vice versa. Interventions in the foreign-exchange market are used to dampen fluctuations in the 
krone rate.

This implies that the decision-making body should be ready to take interest-rate decisions at more or 
less any time, and therefore the structure of the decision-making process is quite different from that of 
a  central  bank  pursuing  an  inflation  target.  Moreover,  the  possibility  of  more  or  less  real-time 
evaluation of the success of Danmarks Nationalbank's monetary policy, i.e. whether the exchange rate 
stays  within  the  band,  implies  that  there  is  no  ambiguity  with  regard  to  fulfilment  of  the  target. 
Accordingly  the  word  transparency  implies  something  different  under  a  fixed-exchange-rate  system 
compared to an inflation-targeting regime. 
It is evident from Chart 6 that the exchange rate against the euro is far more stable than allowed by 
the  fluctuation  band  of  +/-2.25  per  cent  against  the  euro.  In  the  years  preceding  the  breakdown  of 
ERM I in 1992-93 many exchange rates, including the krone, fluctuated widely within the narrow band, 
while primarily the Dutch guilder, the Belgian franc and the Austrian schilling generally fluctuated little 
within  the  bands.  Obligatory  intervention  at  the  margin  was  not  a  rare  event,  and  realignments 
occurred  frequently  in  some  periods.  Part  of  the  explanation  for  these  differences  in  exchange-rate 
dynamics under the two arrangements may be a higher risk of contagion effects from other countries 
under  ERM  I  due  to  the  parity  grid  in  place.  If,  for  example,  macroeconomic  developments  in  one 
member state seemed to justify a realignment of its central parity in the ERM I, this tended to affect 
financial market prices in other member states as well, reflecting expectations of further realignments. 
In  some  cases  this  happened  even  though  macroeconomic  fundamentals  did  not  seem  to  justify 
realignments  in  other  countries,  see  for  example  Favero  and  Giavazzi  for  an  analysis  of  contagion 
under ERM I. From a formal viewpoint there was no centre in ERM I, while ERM II consists of bilateral 
agreements  between  the  ECB  and  each  participating  central  bank.  Problems  in  one  country  are 
therefore less likely to lead to problems for other countries. Of course, at the moment any contagion 
within ERM II can be ruled out as Denmark is currently the only member! 
The widening of the band to +/-15 per cent in 1993 was not considered meaningful as a basis for the 
fixed-exchange-rate  policy  of  Denmark.  Consequently,  Danmarks  Nationalbank  embarked  on  a 
unilateral policy to stabilise the krone with the central parity as a point of reference – albeit from time to 
time a distant point of reference. This policy brought the krone to a stable position close to the central 
parity  in  early  1997.  Since  then,  Danmarks  Nationalbank’s  key  interest  rates  have  shadowed  the 
interest  rates  of  the  Bundesbank,  and  as  of  January  1999  the  interest  rates  of  ECB.  In  addition, 
Danish interest rates have been changed unilaterally in periods with upward or downward pressure on 
the krone and in periods of unrest in foreign-exchange markets. The most notable incidents in recent 
years were in the autumn of 1998 in connection with the global financial turmoil and in the autumn of 
2000 immediately after the referendum that rejected euro area membership.  
It is crucial for the exchange-rate policy that Danmarks Nationalbank follows ECB rates automatically 
without  hesitation,  irrespective  of  domestic  considerations.  Furthermore,  the  short-term  interest  rate 
differential has to be increased promptly if the krone has a pronounced tendency to weaken beyond 
BIS Review 53/2002 
 7
 the day-to-day fluctuations. Intervention in the foreign-exchange market cannot stand alone; but must 
be accompanied by increases in interest rates. It is also an integral element of the foreign-exchange 
defence  that  the  interest-rate  differential  is  increased  quickly  and  substantially,  but  only  reduced 
gradually as a delayed response to currency inflows. This policy ensures that speculation against the 
krone is costly and unprofitable. 
The predominant role of long-term fixed-rate mortgages in Denmark reduces the tensions associated 
with  raising  interest  rates  in  order  to  defend  the  exchange  rate.  Furthermore,  the  monetary  policy 
instruments used by Danmarks Nationalbank allow for a differentiation of monetary-policy signals that 
can ease the burden on “the man in the street” even further – at least in the short run. Commercial 
banks have unlimited access to borrowing at Danmarks Nationalbank in the weekly operations for as 
long  as  they  have  sufficient  collateral.  Danmarks  Nationalbank’s  lending  rate  is  thus  the  decisive 
signal for money-market interest rates.For short periods it may be raised more aggressively than the 
discount  rate,  which  is  the  decisive  rate  for  the  general  borrowing  and  deposit  conditions  at 
commercial  banks.  See  Christensen  and  Topp  (1997)  for  a  detailed  account  of  the  Danish 
monetary-policy instruments and various liquidity measures that can be implemented in the event of 
serious foreign-exchange unrest. 
The fixed-exchange-rate policy and Danmarks Nationalbank’s unconditional willingness to support the 
exchange  rate  are  firmly  embedded  among  participants  in  the  foreign-exchange  market  as  well  as 
among  Danish  exporters  and  importers.  The  large  commercial  banks’  speculative  behaviour  in  the 
foreign-exchange  market  acts  as  a  stabiliser.  If  the  krone  lies  on  the  weak  side  of  the  parity,  the 
commercial banks will position themselves in support of the krone, and they will furthermore advise 
their customers to purchase krone e.g. sell export proceeds  in foreign currency. The reverse is the 
case if the krone is on the strong side of the central parity. All this takes place within a narrow range 
around the central parity.   
Conclusion 
4. 
It is clear from the preceding sections that ERM II is not very visible in the day-to-day management of 
the  Danish  fixed-exchange-rate  policy.Danmarks  Nationalbank  seeks  to  stabilise  the  krone  within  a 
much narrower range than the +/- 2.25 per cent fluctuation band. The ERM II band serves as a safety 
net. It provides international support in a  worst-case scenario. It is probably more important that by 
entering  the  ERM  II  agreement  in  1998  the  Danish  government  strengthened  its  commitment  to 
pursue an economic policy in accordance with the requirements set by the fixed-exchange-rate policy.  
A stability oriented macroeconomic framework conducive to growth and employment can undoubtedly 
be achieved in many different ways. In the case of Denmark the fixed-exchange-rate policy and ERM 
(I and II) membership have been instrumental to the establishment of such a framework. There are 
many country-specific circumstances that make life either easy or difficult under a fixed-exchange-rate 
regime. However, there are two fairly general lessons to be learnt. Firstly, monetary policy must be 
unconditionally subordinated to the exchange rate. Secondly, a fixed-exchange-rate policy is neither 
an  approach  by  which  lower  interest  rates  can  be  achieved  the  easy  way,  nor  a  way  to  postpone 
structural domestic adjustments with the support of the anchor country. The primary responsibility for 
the establishment of a stability oriented macroeconomic framework remains with the individual country 
itself.
