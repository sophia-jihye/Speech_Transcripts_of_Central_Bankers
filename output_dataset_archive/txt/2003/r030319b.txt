 Jarle Bergo: Oil - economic policy challenges 
Address by Mr Jarle Bergo, Deputy Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the 2003 
Southern Norway Conference, Kristiansand, 11 March 2003.  
The address is based on the assessments presented at Norges Bank's press conference following the Executive 
Board's  monetary policy  meeting  on  5  March  and on  previous speeches.  Please  note  that  the  text  below  may 
differ slightly from the actual presentation.  
 Oil is a major component of the Norwegian economy - with all the advantages and disadvantages this 
entails.  Oil  gives  us  an  economic  base  that  is  not  available  to  many  other  countries.  But  it  also 
presents  us  with  considerable  challenges.  How  should  we  use  our  petroleum  wealth  wisely?  This 
question poses a number of economic policy challenges. In my discussion today, I will focus on three 
points:  
First, we must manage our petroleum resources recognising that they are part of our national wealth. 
When oil is extracted and sold, natural assets are transformed into financial wealth. This is not income 
in the ordinary sense. Norway’s national wealth belongs not only to our generation, but also to future 
generations. This means that our petroleum wealth must be equitably distributed between generations. 
The authorities must therefore be disciplined and apply long-term considerations in their spending.  
Moreover, the size of the cash flow from petroleum activities varies considerably. If it were to be used 
as it accrues, this would have an enormous impact on demand impulses in the Norwegian economy, 
and dramatically amplify cyclical fluctuations.  
Third, the use of petroleum revenues will have an impact on competitiveness in Norwegian business 
and industry. A high level of earnings and substantial fluctuations in the use of petroleum revenues 
may have a considerable impact on the operating parameters for internationally exposed industries. It 
is  therefore  important  that  we  succeed  in  maintaining  an  industry  structure  that  promotes  learning, 
innovation and development.  
We are now in a phase where petroleum wealth is being converted from natural resources under the 
seabed to financial assets abroad.  
Both  types  of  wealth  involve  large  amounts  of  capital  and  are  part  of  our  national  wealth,  which 
provides the basis for Norway’s potential consumption over the long term. Consequently, it is crucial 
that our national wealth is managed in a sound and prudent manner, so that the return will be high and 
the risks acceptable.  
Petroleum production generates a profit in excess of a normal return, i.e. economic rent. As economic 
rent  accrues  to  the  state,  this  gives  the  central  government  a  cash  flow  from  petroleum  activities. 
Thus, the central government is now accumulating substantial capital.  
Management  of  the  Petroleum  Fund  poses  challenges.  At  the  same  time,  there  is  a  demographic 
challenge to be faced: the working population will decline sharply, and the proportion receiving income 
from the public sector will rise.  
The chart illustrates developments in the labour force and the number of pensioners in the period up 
to 2050. The blue line shows that the labour force is projected to increase by about 150 000 from 2000 
to 2030. Old-age and disability pensioners will increase by some 500 000, shown by the grey line. This 
means that the number of persons in the labour force relative to the number of pensioners will fall from 
2.6  to  1.8.  These  rough  estimates  are  among  other  things  based  on  the  assumption  that  labour 
immigration remains at the present level.  
The increase in the number of pensioners will result in a sharp increase in the obligations of old-age 
and disability pension funds. Expenditure on old-age and disability pensions is expected to more than 
double  as  a  share  of  total  GDP  in  the  course  of  the  next  30  years.  The  increase  in  the  number  of 
elderly, especially those over the age of 80, will in time require an increase in resources for nursing 
and care services. Welfare reforms that have been adopted will also contribute to increasing the need 
for resources in the public service sector in the years ahead.

 With  an  ageing  population  and  strong  growth  in  expenditure  on  pensions  and  nursing  and  care 
services,  our  petroleum  wealth  will  be  a  welcome  source  of  revenues.  This  is  why  it  is  particularly 
important that it is managed in a sound manner.  
Petroleum activities are a substantial component of the Norwegian economy. In the chart, petroleum 
investment is shown by the blue line, while the red line shows the central government’s net cash flow 
from  petroleum  activities.  Petroleum  investment  rose  sharply  in  the  1970s  and  has  subsequently 
varied  between  4  and  8  per  cent  of  GDP.  Petroleum  investment  fluctuates  considerably  and  has  a 
substantial  impact  on  cyclical  developments  in  the  Norwegian  economy.  The  authorities  can  only 
regulate petroleum investment to a limited extent. It is therefore difficult to prevent the impulses to the 
Norwegian  economy  that  are  generated  by  these  fluctuations.  Consequently,  it  is  all  the  more 
important to prevent fluctuations in the cash flow to the central government from these activities from 
having a direct impact on the economy.  
Allow me to illustrate the consequences this might have: 
Let  us  suppose  that  the  oil  price  temporarily  increased  by  NOK  20  per  barrel,  or  a  little  less  than 
USD 3 per barrel. This is a small change, well within normal variations from one year to the next. The 
central  government’s  net  cash  flow  from  petroleum  activities  would  then  increase  by  around 
NOK 16 billion the first year and NOK 20-22 billion the next. This corresponds to almost 2 per cent of 
Norway's annual GDP.  
If the increase in the cash flow is taken into the economy through higher expenditure or reduced taxes 
in the central government budget,  aggregate domestic demand  will be affected. Higher  expenditure 
requires an increase in the public sector's use of real resources, primarily labour. Two per cent of GDP 
is  then  a  substantial  figure.  If  the  increase  in  petroleum  revenues  is  used  domestically,  this  would 
correspond to almost all the annual growth in the mainland economy in a normal year. If the private 
sector of the economy is also expanding, and the economy is already close to its capacity limit, this 
policy  would  swiftly  lead  to  strong  pressures  on  economic  resources.  This  would  result  in  a  rise  in 
wages and prices. This policy would also lead to unstable conditions in the foreign exchange market. 
When  oil  prices  then  fell  again  and  central  government  expenditure  dropped,  the  economy  would 
experience a very strong contraction.  
The  Government  Petroleum  Fund  was  established  in  1990  with  a  view  to  safeguarding  long-term 
considerations in the use of petroleum revenues. The idea behind the Petroleum Fund is that the cash 
flow from an increase in the oil price should accrue to the Fund and be invested abroad and that the 
increase in the oil price should not affect the wider budget. Thus, rather than affecting the domestic 
economy,  the  increase  in  the  cash  flow  would  be  invested  abroad  through  the  Petroleum  Fund. 
Similarly,  a  fall  in  the  oil  price  would  not  affect  the  domestic  economy,  but  would  result  in  lower 
accumulation of foreign assets. By building up the Fund, the aim of ensuring that several generations 
will enjoy the benefits of our petroleum wealth is also taken into account.  
In  March  2001,  the  fiscal  guideline  and  new  guidelines  for  monetary  policy  were  introduced.  The 
guideline for fiscal policy implies that the central government budget deficit shall be equivalent over 
time to the expected real return on the Government Petroleum Fund. The new guidelines for economic 
policy received broad support in the Storting.  
The guideline specifying that only the real return on the Petroleum Fund is to be used means that the 
capital in the Fund is not depleted. The capital in the Petroleum Fund will increase as long as there is 
a positive cash flow (to the central government) from petroleum activities. When the conversion from 
petroleum  assets  to  financial  wealth  has  been  completed,  the  objective  will  still  be  to  restrict 
withdrawals so that the real value of the Fund’s capital is maintained - in principle, indefinitely.  
The guideline thereby  provides a long-term anchor for fiscal policy. The guideline provides a stable 
framework  that  contributes  to  curbing  fluctuations  in  the  Norwegian  economy  that  are  caused  by 
converting petroleum assets into investment at home and abroad. The guideline has been adhered to 
in the past two years.  
As mentioned, the largest conversion of our national wealth in the next thirty years will be from oil as 
recoverable reserves to oil as financial wealth. The question might, of course, be raised as to whether 
an  alternative  option  would  be  to  keep  our  wealth  in  the  form  of  oil  and  extract  what  we  needed. 
Whether this would be profitable or not depends on oil price developments compared with the return 
on financial assets.

 BIS Review 13/2003
 If we look at the period from 1986 and compare developments in nominal oil prices with the return on a 
fund managed according to the Petroleum Fund's investment strategy - a global portfolio containing 
bonds  and  equities  in  a  60-40  distribution  -  we  see  that  the  fund  would  have  yielded  a  far  higher 
annual return.  
What about the risk? How is it affected by a conversion from oil to financial wealth? History provides 
us with a clear, if somewhat surprising answer. A conversion from oil to financial wealth increases the 
return and at the same time reduces the risk. This is because wealth under the seabed (somewhat 
simplified)  only  consists  of  one  asset,  petroleum,  while  broadly  invested  financial  wealth  is  highly 
diversified in many instruments whose return fluctuates at different rates.  
Today the distribution between financial wealth (the Petroleum Fund) and petroleum is about 20-80. If 
we venture to base our assessment on historical relationships, it is fairly clear that we have, relatively 
speaking,  too  much  oil  in  our  portfolio  and  that  the  current  conversion  to  financial  wealth  is  to  our 
advantage. We have no guarantee, of course, that history will repeat itself, but relying on the opposite 
requires considerable courage.  
The  Petroleum  Fund  can  be  invested  in  two  main  types  of  instruments;  bonds  and  equities.  The 
international  bond  market  is  about  the  same  size  as  the  equity  market.  Government  bonds  are  a 
relatively safe investment, but the return is low. Long-term rates in the US and Europe currently stand 
at around 4 per cent. New investments will thus achieve an annual real rate of return of 1½-2 per cent. 
By way of comparison, the authorities have based their use of petroleum revenues over the central 
government budget on the assumption that the Petroleum Fund can generate a long-term real return 
of 4 per cent. It is unlikely that this rate of return will be achieved if we only invest in bonds.  
Buying a bond means lending money to others. Buying equities is the same as investing in real assets. 
Buying equities gives us direct ownership of the means of production in global business and industry. 
On the one hand, these ownership rights provide high returns when companies are flourishing. On the 
other, shareholders are the first to sustain losses when companies fail. Consequently, the return on 
shares fluctuates far more than the return on bonds, reflecting the higher level of risk. Over the past 
75 years, equity returns in the US market have been negative almost every third year.  
An investor will only invest in high-risk vehicles if it is reasonable to expect compensation for the risk. 
The compensation for high risk in the stock market is a far higher average return for equities compared 
with bonds. Since 1926, the annual return on US equities has on average been 4.8 percentage points 
higher  than  the  return  on  bonds.  Also  in  most  ten-year  periods,  investing  in  US  equities  has  been 
profitable,  with  the  exception  of  the  depression  in  the  1930s  and  the  last  half  of  the  1970s.  Equity 
returns have been negative after ten years only in the years between 1928 and 1938, in other words 
on equity investments made the year before the 1929 stock market crash.  
It may also be worth noting that equities purchased during recessions - such as in the mid-1930s and 
mid-1970s - brought solid returns ten years later. The picture is the same for most other countries.  
Since short-term fluctuations in equity prices are difficult to predict, it may be a sound strategy to keep 
the share of equities constant over time. This means buying a relatively large volume of equities when 
prices are low, and buying a smaller volume - or selling - when prices are high. This is the strategy 
applied by the Petroleum Fund.  
Let  us  now  revert  to  the  Norwegian  economy  and  Norwegian  economic  policy.  The  revision  of 
economic policy in March 2001 can to some extent be said to be a consequence of our oil economy. 
The new guidelines have also changed the interaction between the different components of economic 
policy. Fiscal policy will now have an expansionary effect. In order to prevent pressure from becoming 
too  strong,  monetary  policy  has  to  be  tighter  than  would  otherwise  have  been  the  case.  Monetary 
policy has therefore been given a clearer role in stabilising economic developments.  
A  clear  monetary  policy  target  is  a  necessary  complement  to  the  fiscal  guideline  with  a  view  to 
ensuring reasonable macroeconomic stability. The operational target of monetary policy as defined by 
the Government is inflation of close to 2.5 per cent over time. The inflation target provides economic 
agents  with  an  anchor  for  their  decisions  concerning  saving,  investment,  budgets  and  wages. 
Households,  businesses,  public  entities,  employees  and  employers  can  base  decisions  on  the 
assumption that inflation in Norway will be 2½ per cent over time.  
The rise in labour costs is an important factor underlying Norges Bank’s assessment of the inflation 
outlook and interest rate  decisions. If wage growth is too high - both in manufacturing  industry and 
other  industries  -  the  internationally  exposed  sector  will  be  affected  in  two  ways.  First,  high  wage 
BIS Review 13/2003

 growth will itself reduce earnings and employment. Second, the interest rate will be raised. Normally, 
this will lead to an appreciation of the krone, with a further reduction in earnings and employment. This 
will amplify the impact of high wage growth on manufacturing industry. Since the new guidelines on 
the  use  of  petroleum  revenues  were  introduced  in  a  period  when  the  labour  market  was  tight,  the 
krone was expected to be strong in periods.  
The interest rate differential between Norway and trading partners has resulted in a strong krone. The 
wide interest rate differential is due to the historically low level of interest rates abroad. The slowdown 
in global growth has been more pronounced and spanned a longer period than we had expected. The 
Norwegian  economy  has  also  felt  the  effects  of  this.  Norges  Bank  has  therefore  lowered  the  sight 
deposit rate from 7 to 5.5 per cent since 11 December, most recently on 5 March. The interest rate 
differential has narrowed. Since mid-January, the krone has depreciated, partly reflecting expectations 
of lower interest rates. Monetary policy has been relaxed.  
There is uncertainty associated with developments in many of the factors that will influence inflation 
ahead, among others the exchange rate. This implies a gradual approach to the conduct of monetary 
policy.  
Increased spending of petroleum revenues will have implications for Norway’s industry structure. High 
demand for goods and services that require domestic resources, necessitates higher employment in 
the sheltered sector. This labour has to be recruited from the exposed sector, or through the natural 
increase in the labour force finding its way to the sheltered sector.  
Even if employment and output in Norwegian manufacturing industry fall, developments for Norwegian 
enterprises  may  not  necessarily  be  only  negative.  Some  enterprises  may  be  at  the  cutting  edge  of 
technology, and increase their efficiency in pace with the rise in costs in Norway.  
Others may relocate labour-intensive activities abroad. The scaling back of manufacturing still involves 
a  risk.  It  makes  the  economy  more  vulnerable;  the  foundation  for  learning,  innovation  and 
development may be undermined when a smaller share of the business sector is exposed to intense 
international competition.  
Even with a sustained extra currency income in the form of the return on the Petroleum Fund, the main 
share  of  Norwegian  imports  must  be  financed  using  revenues  deriving  from  exports  of  goods  and 
services from mainland Norway. This places demands on profitability in exposed industries. In the long 
run, cost competitiveness must be adapted to the need for financing imports and securing balance in 
the external economy.  
Imports  currently  account  for  more  than  30  per  cent  of  GDP  in  Norway.  The  return  on  the 
Petroleum Fund will range between 4-5 per cent of GDP when the bulk of our oil resources have been 
extracted and converted into financial wealth. This means that no more than close to 1/5 of imports 
can be financed on the basis of oil in the long run. In other words, if the share of imports is to remain at 
the current level, a sizeable internationally exposed sector will be needed to finance imports.  
Both our petroleum wealth and financial wealth are sizeable. However, it is the discounted value of our 
own  labour  that  is  our  predominant  asset.  Our  livelihood  essentially  depends,  and  will  continue  to 
depend in the future, on our ability to produce goods and services efficiently through our labour, and to 
use our creativity and innovation to become ever more efficient.  
This can be illustrated by the following example: If a perception that oil has made us so wealthy that 
we can to some extent relax leads to a reduction in annual productivity growth of a quarter percentage 
point, i.e. a reduction in trend GDP growth from the current level of about 2 per cent to 1¾ per cent, 
the income base would be reduced by more than the entire return on petroleum wealth.  
Societies  that  suddenly  gain  access  to  wealth  deriving  from  natural  resources  have  a  tendency  to 
spend the money and then fall into decline. A very clear example of this can be found in Spain already 
in the 1660s. The colonisation of South and Central America gave this country access to a wealth of 
natural resources, and to gold. Spain chose to spend a large portion of the windfalls on luxury  and 
war. The attitude to working that this led to did not make it easy for these countries to get back on their 
feet again when the gold came to an end.  
Many countries have had similar experiences in more recent times. The expression “Dutch disease” 
comes from the turn of events in the Dutch economy in the 1970s and 1980s after the revenues from 
the large gas finds in the Groningen field were used to finance strong growth in public spending. When 
the gas revenues declined, economic growth came to a halt and economy policy had to be tightened.

 BIS Review 13/2003
 Several studies of the relationship between long-term economic growth and natural resources show 
that  countries  with  an  abundant  suppy  of  natural  resources  have  tendency  to  experience  lower 
economic  growth.  Why?  In  principle,  an  abundance  of  natural  resources  is  an  advantage  for  a 
country's economy.  
One of the main findings of the studies on the relationship between long-term economic growth and 
the supply of natural resources is illustrated in the chart. The chart was made by Jeffrey Sachs and 
Andrew Warner, two of the most prominent researchers who have studied the phenomenon that has 
come  to  be  known  as  the  “resource  curse”.  They  use  the  size  of  a  country’s  exports  of  natural 
resources in relation to GDP in 1970 to measure how rich the various countries are in terms of natural 
resources.  There  is  a  negative  correlation  between  the  supply  of  natural  resources  and  economic 
growth  in  the  period  1970-1989.  The  group  of  countries  with  the  highest  growth  rates  includes  the 
Asian  tigers,  which  have  had  a  very  limited  supply  of  natural  resources.  Several  of  the  oil-rich 
countries around the Persian Gulf fall into the group of countries with the lowest growth. This could 
suggest that it is not necessarily an advantage to have an abundance of natural resources. There are 
many factors that influence economic growth. Sachs and Warner only look at one of these factors in 
their  chart.  The  relationship  has  proved  to  be  relatively  robust,  however.  It  is  true  that  some 
economists have argued that the negative relationship does not apply when institutional factors in the 
countries included in the study are taken into account.  
Venezuela is one of the poorest performing countries in the Sachs and Warner study. The country has 
the largest known oil reserves in the world, and also has an abundance of other natural resources. 
Venezuela has been among the largest oil producers since the 1920s. But as a result of an unsound 
economic policy, the country has not been able to achieve solid and stable economic growth. After the 
rise in oil prices in the 1970s, government spending increased sharply. In the 1980s, fiscal policy was 
also highly expansionary. The result was high inflation and rising unemployment. Close to 85 per cent 
of the country’s population is living in poverty. Economic growth has been weak. Between 1970 and 
2002, GDP per capita has fallen by about 20 per cent.  
Why have many countries failed to make good use of windfalls? There may be a number of reasons. 
In terms of economic policy, an explanation is that the wealth deriving from the resources leads to an 
extreme focus on acquiring as much of this extra wealth by various groups. The contest for this profit 
is often referred to as “rent-seeking behaviour”. Countries with an abundance of natural resources may 
be  more  vulnerable  to  extreme  “rent-seeking  behaviour”  than  economies  with  a  limited  supply  of 
natural resources. The competition between the various factions can lead to an inefficient tapping of 
natural resources and an unsound use of revenues. The spirit of enterprise, talent and energy in both 
business and political life are used to acquire a share of this income rather than to foster productive 
activity in both the public and private sector. For an individual company or a group, this activity may 
seem rational - a 10 per cent chance to win the jackpot could be better than investing in a business 
that yields an ordinary return. This may have damaging consequences for a country.  
A  sociological  explanation  is  that  easily  acquired  wealth  weakens  the  incentive  for  innovation  and 
work.  We  feel  that  we  have  become  rich  and  want  to  live  the  good  life.  A  possible  economic 
explanation  is  that  a  large  and  broad  sector  that  is  exposed  to  international  competition  fosters 
learning  and  development.  Without  such  a  sector,  the  competitive  intensity  in  the  economy  may 
decline and the ability and willingness to be innovative may be impaired.  
We  must  be  cautious  about  drawing  final  conclusions  based  on  historical  comparisons.  We  would 
prefer to assume that we are managing our wealth better. However, it may be of particular relevance 
to  highlight  three  critical  pre-conditions  for  succeeding  in  this.  First:  Decision-making  forms  and 
processes in the political and economic arena must provide effective protection against the acquisition 
by interest groups of the right to use large shares of the petroleum wealth. Second: It is important for 
the growth potential in the economy that  we maintain a broad sector in the mainland economy that 
works  under  intense  competition  so  that  we  maintain  and  strengthen  the  incentive  to  acquire 
knowledge  and to be innovative. Third: It is important that  we bear in mind the issue of distribution 
across generations and that we manage the wealth as an asset.
