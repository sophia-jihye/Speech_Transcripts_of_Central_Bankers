 Introduction 
1. 
Until  recently  the  exchange  rate  arrangements  of  Denmark  and  Iceland  were  similar  from  a  formal 
point of view. Both countries pursued a policy classified as fixed, but adjustable exchange rates. There 
were some differences as well. From a formal viewpoint the anchors were different. Iceland pegged a 
basket of currencies roughly reflecting the composition of the effective exchange rate, while Denmark 
in the whole period from the breakdown of the Bretton Woods-system in 1971/73 has participated in 
the various European exchange-rate arrangements. It was of greater significance, however, how the 
weights to each of the words “fixed” and “adjustable” developed in the two countries. 
The main  theme  of  this  article  is  why  and  how  Denmark  increasingly  gave  importance  to  the  word 
“fixed” and how the present institutions work. At the same time some considerations will be given to 
why  Iceland  has  drawn  the  opposite  conclusion  and  now  pursues  a  flexible  exchange-rate  policy 
within  the  framework  known  as  inflation-forecast  targeting,  cf.  Svensson  (1997)  and  several  other 
contributors. 
There  is  presently  little  disagreement  among  economists  that  the  ultimate  goal  of  monetary  policy 
should be price stability. Indeed, in the statute of the recently established European Central Bank price 
stability is clearly stated as the primary objective of the bank, and it is made clear that support of the 
general economic policies in the Community is only a secondary objective. In the USA, price stability 
enters  the  objectives  for  monetary  policy,  which  most  other  OECD-countries  are  using  inflation 
targeting strategies. 
Exchange-rate developments 
2. 
Before the creation of the European Monetary Union, most of the EU member states participated in 
the  European  Monetary  System  -  a fixed-exchange-rate  system  based  on  a  grid  of  bilateral  central 
parities and intervention bands. Currently, three EU member states have not adopted the euro: while 
the UK and Sweden have inflation-targeting regimes and a floating exchange rate vis-à-vis the euro, 
Denmark follows a fixed-exchange-rate  policy vis-à-vis the euro. The intermediate target for Danish 
monetary policy is thus the krone/euro exchange rate. 
The  new  European  fixed-exchange-rate  system,  ERM  II,  came  into  operation  on  1  January  1999 
replacing  ERM  I.  Denmark  became  a  member  immediately,  with  a  narrow  fluctuation  band  of 
+/−2.25 per cent around a central parity of 746.038 kroner per 100 euro. In the Vienna communiqué of 
September 1998 the Danish narrow band is commented with “the high level of economic convergence 
achieved by Denmark in terms of the convergence criteria, including the very high degree of stability of 
the krone in the markets and the unchanged parity within ERM I since January 1987. This is the result 
of sustained stability-oriented economic policies”. The standard fluctuation band in ERM II is +/–15 per 
cent. 
Membership of ERM II was not a major change of the Danish monetary regime. As a matter of fact, 
Denmark has a very long tradition for a fixed-exchange-rate policy. The central parity vis-à-vis the euro 
corresponds exactly to the former central rate vis-à-vis the D-mark, which was unchanged from early 
1987,  cf.  Chart  1.  Furthermore,  by  1982,  exchange-rate  realignments  ceased  to  be  a  self-initiated 
Danish policy instrument. In 1998, ERM I had 12 members, the 11 countries that now form the euro-
area  and  Denmark.  Presently,  with  Denmark  as  the  only  member  of  ERM  II,  there  is  little  risk  of 
contagion from problems originating elsewhere. However, the hubs and spokes approach in ERM II 
compared  to  the  bilateral  parity-grid  in  ERM  I,  lowers  the  risk  of  contagion  in  case  more  countries 
participate.

The  firm  commitment  to  a  fixed-exchange-rate  policy  originates  from  very  poor  performance  of 
macroeconomic  policy  and,  consequently,  poor  performance  of  the  Danish  economy  in  the  1970s. 
Against the background of high inflation, excessive budget deficits, permanent deficits on the current 
account  of  the  balance  of  payments,  frequent  devaluations  of  the  krone  and  high  nominal  interest 
rates,  the  Danish  authorities  in  the  early  1980s  made  a  successful  U-turn  to  a  stability-oriented 
macroeconomic regime. The fixed-exchange-rate policy was, and still is, an important element in the 
macroeconomic  framework 
in  Denmark.  See  Christensen  and  Topp  (1997)  and  Danmarks 
Nationalbank  (1999)  for  a  more  detailed  review  of  the  change  in  Danish  economic  policy  in  the 
aforementioned period. 
Participation in ERM is voluntary for EU member states. While participation in ERM I and ERM II have 
been  beneficial  to  the  Danish  economy  in  its  own  right,  these  exchange-rate  systems  and  the 
successful introduction of the euro should be viewed in a much broader context than from a purely 
monetary policy perspective. EU member states co-operate on a large range of political and economic 
issues  and  have  set  up  a  common  legal  and  institutional  framework,  of  which  the  ECB  is  only  one 
example. This probably contributed to a smooth transition to a common monetary policy. 
The Danish fixed-exchange-rate policy 
3.  
It is important to emphasise that the Danish exchange-rate policy is a fixed-exchange-rate policy, and 
not  a  fixed,  but  adjustable,  exchange  rate.  Taken  literally,  this  can  only  be  true  with  euro  area 
membership.  However,  in  a  Danish  policy  context  it  means  that  macroeconomic  policies  are 
conducted with a view to ensuring a fixed exchange rate. There is no contingency plan if things go 
wrong.  In  retrospect,  it  should  be  mentioned  that  this  was  a  process  gradually  evolving  in  the  mid 
1980s and not fully completed until 1987 and not fully understood until the early 1990s, as was the 
case with the implications of the full liberalization of financial markets completed in 1988. The 1982 
decision  did  not  prevent  small  adjustments  against  the  D-mark  in  1983,  1986  and  1987.  These 
adjustments  took  place  in  connection  with  adjustments  demanded  by  other  countries.  France  also 
stopped adjusting the parity after 1987. 
The  two  key  conditions  for  success  are  a  strong  commitment  from  the  authorities  to  abstain  from 
creating “home made” shocks (which according to the Danish experience are far more important than 
exogenous external shocks) and  an  unconditional  willingness to subordinate monetary  policy  to the 
exchange-rate strategy.

 BIS Review 22/2003
 The Icelandic experience has been quite different. According to Andersen and Gudmundsson (1998) 
Iceland has been subject to several external shocks, most related to fishing, either catches or prices. It 
is remarkable, however, that most shocks have been positive. From this perspective an appreciation of 
the Icelandic krone could have been an obvious way to distribute the increasing real income across 
the  nation.  However,  this  took  place  via  inflation  in  wages,  leading  to  rising  real-wages  as  well, 
because of the high share of imported goods in private consumption. When profitabilty in fishing got 
squeezed demands for a depreciation of the currency were normally met after some time, cf. Chart 2. 
It is noteworthy, however, that this process has moderated in recent years even before the change in 
monetary-policy framework in 2001.

Price stability 
A first test of the benefits of a monetary regime is to see if it delivers on the final goal. For a central 
bank  the  key  issue  is  price  stability,  and  the  Danish  monetary  regime  passes  the  test.  Inflation 
measured  as  the  percentage  annual  increase  in  the  harmonised  consumer  price  index  (HICP)  has 
been stable at around 2 per cent in Denmark since the early 1990s, cf. Chart 3. The persistence of low 
inflation  has  furthermore  been  conducive  to  low  inflationary  expectations.  In  the  period  since  the 
announcement of the fixed-exchange-rate policy low and stable inflation has been achieved  without 
loss of income relative to our major trading partners, Germany, Sweden and the UK, although it should 
be recalled that the transition to a low-inflation economy is not an isolated Danish phenomenon. Most 
OECD countries have achieved the same in the last decade, independently of their monetary-policy 
regimes. Consequently, Danish inflation performance cannot be taken as a proof of the superiority of a 
fixed-exchange-rate regime compared to other regimes.

Monetary policy and the business cycle 
A fixed-exchange-rate policy implies that the stance of monetary policy is from time to time out of line 
with domestic short-term cyclical needs, and is potentially a destabilising factor. When key monetary-
policy  interest  rates  are  closely  linked  to  German  interest  rates,  and  since  1999  euro-area  interest 
rates,  there  is  no  room  for  independent  domestic  stabilisation  by  means  of  monetary  policy.  This 
problem appears to be particularly severe in Denmark, where the business cycle - at least according to 
visual inspection - seems to be negatively correlated with the cyclical conditions in Germany and the 
euro area, cf. Chart 4. However, it is also possible to draw a completely opposite conclusion from the 
deviation in the cyclical patterns: cyclical divergence is immaterial to the success of a fixed-exchange-
rate policy. 
The monetary-policy transmission mechanism is of crucial importance in the choice between business-
cycle  and  exchange-rate  stabilisation.  The  direct  effect  from  changes  in  short-term  interest  rates  to 
domestic demand is comparatively small in Denmark. The terms for mortgage financing, which is the 
most  important  transmission  channel  to  the  household  sector,  are  predominantly  based  on  fixed 
20-year or 30-year mortgage bond yields. Adjustable mortgage lending at 1-5 year interest rates has, 
however, gained in importance in recent years. In early 2003 approximately 30 per cent of mortgage-
credit-lending  has  adjustable  rates,  in  part  reflecting  a  substitution  from  bank-lending  to  mortgage-
credit-lending. In spite of this, it is  unlikely  to create  major problems for handling future speculative 
attacks, because the spill-over to 12-months rates is rather limited. The greater concern with respect 
to  adjustable  rate  mortgages  is  the  financial  health  of  households  in  case  of  a  more  global  rise  in 
interest rates, of Christensen and Kjeldsen (2002). 
The basic textbook model includes only one policy instrument for short-term stabilisation - monetary 
policy.  This  is  a  standard  formulation  in  the  literature  and  also  in  line  with  practice  in  most 
industrialised  countries.  Discretionary  fiscal  policy  came  into  disrespect  after  the  abuse  of  the 
instrument in the 1960s and 1970s, which led to stagflation, large budget deficits and high public debt 
in many countries. Denmark has also suffered from this experience, but discretionary fiscal policy is 
still used to stabilise the economy.

It is important to underline that the frequency of discretionary fiscal measures is low and far below the 
frequency  of  monetary-policy  changes  in  countries  with  other  monetary  regimes.  The  government 
does not meet every two weeks to consider an adjustment to e.g. the VAT rate following the latest 
business-cycle information. During the past decade discretionary fiscal stabilisation measures outside 
the  normal  central-government  budgetary  calendar  have  been  introduced  on  three  occasions: 
temporary  expansive  measures  in  1993,  and  contractive  measures  in  1997  and  1998,  cf.  Chart  5. 
However,  considerations  regarding  the  appropriate  macroeconomic  impulse  from  the  government 
budget to output are made during the annual budget negotiations. In years when fiscal policy has not 
been  used  for  stabilisation  purposes  the  fiscal  impulse,  i.e.  the  contemporaneous  contribution  to 
GDP-growth from fiscal policy in a given year, has been close to zero. As is the case in most countries 
it  is  also  politically  easier  to  increase  public  expenditure  and  reduce  taxes  than  the  opposite  in 
Denmark. However, it is our assessment that the reliance on a fixed exchange rate and occasional 
discretionary fiscal policy measures has dampened this inherent problem by a greater medium-term 
focus in fiscal policy. 
Quite  the  contrary,  the  fixed-exchange-rate  policy  has  been  instrumental  in  the  significant 
improvement  in  Danish  economic  policy  that  has  taken  place  in  the  last  10-15  years.  The  Danish 
government, supported by a large majority in the Danish parliament, is committed to use fiscal policy if 
inflationary  developments are out of line  with the exchange-rate policy. The  government has stated 
that fiscal policy will be adjusted if inflation deviates more than temporarily from the ECB’s definition of 
price stability (0-2 pct. increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices - HICP). 
Fiscal  measures  are  taken  with  due  regard  for  developments  in  government  debt  as  well  as  in  the 
current account. Indeed, except for 1998 Denmark has had a surplus on the current account of the 
balance  of  payments  since  1990,  while  there  has  been  a  surplus  on  the  government  budget  since 
1997.  Furthermore  and  equally  important,  the  fixed-exchange-rate  policy  has  brought  structural 
reforms of the tax and benefit systems and the labour market to the policy forefront as the necessary 
tools to ensure low unemployment and growth in real income.

The stability and growth pact in EU has been discussed on several occasions over the years. At the 
core is that countries should keep their budgets close to balance to have room for letting the automatic 
stabilisers work also during periods of weak activity. In this way deficits can be kept below the 3 per 
cent  maximum  set  by  the  Treaty  without  problems  unless  the  downturn  is  extraordinary  severe.  In 
such cases sanctions will not be used. 
Denmark is also part of the stability and growth pact. The biggest difference between Euro members 
and  UK,  Sweden  and  Denmark  with  respect  to  the  pact  is  that  sanctions  cannot  be  given  to  the 
Out-countries.  The  stability  and  growth  pact  has  been  seen  as  framework  for  medium  term  fiscal 
prudence in Denmark, cf. Chart 6.

 Asymmetric shocks, home-made shocks and exchange-rate policy in Denmark 
A  floating  exchange  rate  is  often  considered  useful  in  order  to  insulate  an  economy  from  certain 
shocks  in  a  world  with  nominal  wage  rigidity  and/or  limited  labour  mobility.  A  fixed-exchange-rate 
policy  can  lead  to  excessive  and  protracted  unemployment  in  such  a  world,  and  adjustment  to 
asymmetric shocks is - at least in theory - an important argument against a fixed-exchange-rate policy. 
However, the importance of this argument requires answers to the following two questions: 1) What 
causes large positive and large negative output gaps? 2) Is a floating exchange rate an efficient shock 
absorber? 
The Danish economy was in severe slump in 1981, reached a peak in 1986, went back into a period of 
slow growth, bottoming out in 1993, and has grown strongly since and exhausted the negative output 
gap, cf. Chart 4. The business cycle was also out of line with Germany as well as the entire euro area. 
The business cycle in itself and the deviation to the German business cycle cannot be explained by 
exogenous external factors. Firstly, the demand for Danish exports did not deviate from the trend to an 
extent  that  can  explain  the  cyclical  swings  in  the  period  under  observation.  Secondly,  the  terms  of 
trade  moved  more  or  less  in  line  with  the  terms  of  trade  for  other  EU  member  states,  ruling  out 
external price shocks as an explanation. Hence, the roots of Danish output fluctuations are to be found 
among domestic factors. Accordingly, the analysis does not carry over to an economy subject to large 
external shocks. 
The trough in 1981 had its origin in the very poor macroeconomic policies of the 1970s that can be 
summarised as traditional Keynesian demand stimulus to the oil-price shocks that led to long-term real 
interest  rates  in  excess  of  10  per  cent.  The  sharp  fall  in  nominal  interest  rates  following  the 
announcement  of  the  fixed-exchange-rate  policy  in  1982,  in  combination  with  other  austerity 
measures,  was  not  accompanied  by  a  corresponding  immediate  reduction  in  inflation  expectations. 
This led to a decline in expected ex-ante after-tax real interest rates that triggered a boom in house 
prices  and  private  consumption,  leading  to  the  peak  in  1986.  The  until  then  highly  preferential  tax 
treatment  of  interest-rate  expenditures  was  reduced  as  from  1987.  A  decline  in  actual  inflation  in 
combination with the tax changes led to a sharp increase in ex-post after-tax real interest rates that 
triggered  the  proceeding  depression  in  the  housing  market  and  a  strong  increase  in  the  private 
savings ratio. The Danish experience over the last twenty years is thus that “home made” domestic 
shocks stemming from economic policy are more important than exogenous external shocks. 
The  choice  of  exchange-rate  regime  is  not  a  choice  between  a  fixed  nominal  exchange  rate  and  a 
floating  exchange  rate  that  evolves  according  to  purchasing  power  parity.  A  floating  exchange  rate 
often  moves  relatively  far  away  from  any  reasonable  estimate  of  purchasing  power  parity  and  thus 
acts as a shock creator rather than a shock absorber, cf. Buiter (2000). The strength of the dollar in 
the mid-1980s and the weakness of the euro until recently are well-known examples. The importance 
of such unwarranted disturbances is most severe for small open economies such as Denmark. The 
exchange-rate  movements  depicted  in  Chart  7  and  Chart  8  indicate  that  Sweden  -  a  small  open 
economy with a floating exchange rate and low inflation - receives far more noise from exchange-rate 
fluctuations than Denmark. The fixed-exchange-rate policy cannot ensure a stable nominal effective 
exchange rate or a stable real effective exchange rate. However, the weight to the euro in the effective 
Danish exchange rate is slightly below 60 per cent. Thereby, the fixed-exchange-rate policy yields a 
nominal hedge in a very important market for the Danish economy. This planning stability is beneficial 
to the business climate. A fixed-exchange-rate policy based on the nominal effective exchange rate 
would not offer such a hedge against any specific currency. 
Monetary policy implementation and ERM II 
4. 
The krone has remained close to the central parity against the euro since ERM II and the third stage of 
the European Monetary Union came into operation on 1 January 1999, cf. Chart 9. 
In order to achieve exchange-rate stability, the interest rates of Danmarks Nationalbank are adjusted 
in step with those of the ECB, with due consideration of conditions in the foreign-exchange market, cf. 
Chart 10. A tendency for the krone to weaken will be met by a widening of the interest-rate differential, 
and vice versa. Interventions in the foreign-exchange market are used to dampen fluctuations in the 
krone rate.

Note: The real effective krone rate is based on consumer prices. Most recent observation is June 2002. 
This implies that the decision-making body should be ready to take interest-rate decisions at more or 
less any time, and therefore the structure of the decision-making process is quite different from that of 
a  central  bank  pursuing  an  inflation  target.  Moreover,  the  possibility  of  more  or  less  real-time 
evaluation of the success of Danmarks Nationalbank’s monetary policy, i.e. whether the exchange rate 
stays  within  the  band,  implies  that  there  is  no  ambiguity  with  regard  to  fulfilment  of  the  target. 
Accordingly  the  word  transparency  implies  something  different  under  a  fixed-exchange-rate  system 
and an inflation-targeting regime, cf. Storgaard (2002).

It is evident from Chart 8 that the exchange rate against the euro is far more stable than allowed by 
the fluctuation  band of +/–2.25  per cent against the  euro. In the  years preceding the breakdown of 
ERM I in 1992-93 many exchange rates, including the krone, fluctuated widely within the narrow band, 
while primarily the Dutch guilder, the Belgian franc and the Austrian schilling generally fluctuated little 
within  the  bands.  Obligatory  intervention  at  the  margin  was  not  a  rare  event,  and  realignments 
occurred  frequently  in  some  periods.  Part  of  the  explanation  for  these  differences  in  exchange-rate 
dynamics under the two arrangements may be a higher risk of contagion effects from other countries 
under  ERM  I  due  to  the  parity  grid  in  place.  If,  for  example,  macroeconomic  developments  in  one 
member state seemed to justify a realignment of its central parity in the ERM I, this tended to affect 
financial market prices in other member states as well, reflecting expectations of further realignments. 
BIS Review 22/2003

 In  some  cases  this  happened  even  though  macroeconomic  fundamentals  did  not  seem  to  justify 
realignments  in  other  countries,  see  for  example  Favero  and  Giavazzi  for  an  analysis  of  contagion 
under ERM I. From a formal viewpoint there was no centre in ERM I, while ERM II consists of bilateral 
agreements between the ECB and each participating central bank. Problems in one country are there 
fore less likely to lead to problems for other countries. Of course, at the moment any contagion within 
ERM II can be ruled out as Denmark is currently the only member! From May 2004 onwards it can be 
envisaged  that  some  of  the  applicant  countries  will  start  to  participate  in  ERM  II,  but  the  risks  of 
contagion are considered to be small due to the hubs and spokes arrangement. 
The widening of the band to +/–15 per cent in 1993 was not considered meaningful as a basis for the 
fixed-exchange-rate  policy  of  Denmark.  Consequently,  Danmarks  Nationalbank  embarked  on  a 
unilateral policy to stabilise the krone with the central parity as a point of reference - albeit from time to 
time a distant point of reference. This policy brought the krone to a stable position close to the central 
parity  in  early  1997.  Since  then,  Danmarks  Nationalbank’s  key  interest  rates  have  shadowed  the 
interest  rates  of  the  Bundesbank,  and  as  of  January  1999  the  interest  rates  of  ECB.  In  addition, 
Danish interest rates have been changed unilaterally in periods with upward or downward pressure on 
the krone and in periods of unrest in foreign-exchange markets. The most notable incidents in recent 
years were in the autumn of 1998 in connection with the global financial turmoil and in the autumn of 
2000 immediately after the referendum that rejected euro area membership. 
It  is  crucial  for  the  exchange-rate  policy  that  Danmarks  Nationalbank  follows  ECB  rates  without 
hesitation, irrespective of domestic considerations. Furthermore, the short-term interest rate differential 
has to be increased promptly if the krone has a pronounced tendency to weaken beyond the day-to-
day  fluctuations.  Intervention  in  the  foreign-exchange  market  cannot  stand  alone,  but  must  be 
accompanied by appropriate increases in interest rates. In this respect the present Danish exchange 
rate arrangement is close to a currency board. It is also an integral element of the foreign-exchange 
defence  that  the  interest-rate  differential  is  increased  quickly  and  substantially,  but  only  reduced 
gradually as a delayed response to currency inflows. This policy ensures that speculation against the 
krone is costly and unprofitable. 
The  predominant  role  of  long-term  fixed-rate  mortgages  in  Denmark  and  the  limited  spill-over  from 
fluctuations in short-term rates to maturities of 12 month or more reduces the tensions associated with 
raising  interest  rates  in  order  to  defend  the  exchange  rate.  Furthermore,  the  monetary  policy 
instruments used by Danmarks Nationalbank allow for a differentiation of monetary-policy signals that 
can ease the burden on “the man in the street” even further - at least in the short run. Commercial 
banks have unlimited access to borrowing at Danmarks Nationalbank in the weekly operations for as 
long  as  they  have  sufficient  collateral.  Danmarks  Nationalbank’s  lending  rate  is  thus  the  decisive 
signal for money-market interest rates.For short periods it may be raised more aggressively than the 
discount  rate,  which  is  the  decisive  rate  for  the  general  borrowing  and  deposit  conditions  at 
commercial  banks.  See  Danmarks  Nationalbank  (1999,  2003)  for  a  detailed  account  of  the  Danish 
monetary-policy instruments and various liquidity measures that can be implemented in the event of 
serious  foreign-exchange  unrest.  Presently  issues  regarding  speculative  attacks  seem  to  be  of  a 
theoretical nature with interest rate spreads against Germany at 15-20 basis points all along the yield 
curve. However, we continue to be prepared for even remote eventualities. 
The fixed-exchange-rate policy and Danmarks Nationalbank’s unconditional willingness to support the 
exchange  rate  are  firmly  embedded  among  participants  in  the  foreign-exchange  market  as  well  as 
among  Danish  exporters  and  importers.  The  large  commercial  banks’  speculative  behaviour  in  the 
foreign-exchange  market  acts  as  a  stabiliser.  If  the  krone  lies  on  the  weak  side  of  the  parity,  the 
commercial banks will position themselves in support of the krone, and they will furthermore advise 
their customers to purchase krone e.g. sell export proceeds  in foreign currency. The reverse is the 
case if the krone is on the strong side of the central parity. All this takes place within a narrow range 
around the central parity. 
From an economic point of view, the ERM II works smoothly and Denmarks has almost the samme 
exchange-rate  stability  as  we  would  have  had  in  case  of  membership  of  the  European  Monetary 
Union. 
From a political point of view the situation is completely different. During the second stage of EMU, the 
Nationalbank participated fully in the preparatory work for the third stage. This came to an abrupt halt 
in  the  summer  of  1998  when  the  ECB  started.  When  the  party  to  celebrate  the  new  institution  in 
Frankfurts Alte Oper on 30 June 1998 was over, the Nationalbank found itself marginalised. From one 
day to the next we went from a position in the core with our share of influence to a position without

 influence and with difficulties in finding out what is on the active agenda. The Governing Council of the 
ECB has the understandable attitude that those who participate are those who decide, irrespectively of 
Danish participation in ERM II. This position is only fair and the Nationalbank of course accepts it. That 
being said, it is problematic because of the importance for the Nationalbank of the work of the ECB, 
not  least  because  Denmarks  position  as  an  out-country  is  not  given  by  a  lack  of  fulfilment  of  the 
convergence  criteria.  The  mandate  of  the  General  Council,  where  the  Nationalbank  participates,  is 
quite limited. The Council only meets four times a year. 
At the September 2000-referendum the majority of Danish voters rejected EMU-participation. In early 
2003 polls suggest that the overwhelming majority of voters now favour participation, and even more 
voters feel sure that Denmark eventually will participate. It makes it more problematic to be without 
influence when full participation is a relevant alternative. 
At  the  same  time  this  implies  a  clear  exit  strategy,  namely  EMU-participation.  Most  other  countries 
trying to conduct a fixed-exchange-rate  policy,  including Iceland, have  not had  the same lighthouse 
ahead,  making  it  difficult  to  generalise  the  Danish  experiences  to  countries  with  other  institutional 
arrangements. 
Conclusion 
5. 
From an operational point of view the main importance of ERM II is to provide the central parity of the 
krone against the Euro. 
Danmarks  Nationalbank  seeks  to  stabilise  the  krone  within  a  much  narrower  range  than  the 
+/−2.25 per cent fluctuation band. The ERM II band serves as a safety net. It provides international 
support in a worst-case scenario. It is probably more important that by entering the ERM II agreement 
in  1998  the  Danish  government  strengthened  its  commitment  to  pursue  an  economic  policy  in 
accordance with the requirements set by the fixed-exchange-rate policy. 
A stability oriented macroeconomic framework conducive to growth and employment can undoubtedly 
be achieved in many different ways. In the case of Denmark the fixed-exchange-rate policy and ERM 
(I and II) membership have been instrumental to the establishment of such a framework. There are 
many country-specific circumstances that make life either easy or difficult under a fixed-exchange-rate 
regime. However, there are two fairly general lessons to be learnt. Firstly, monetary policy must be 
unconditionally subordinated to the exchange rate. Secondly, a fixed-exchange-rate policy is neither 
an  approach  by  which  lower  interest  rates  can  be  achieved  the  easy  way,  nor  a  way  to  postpone 
structural domestic adjustments with the support of the anchor country. The primary responsibility for 
the establishment of a stability oriented macroeconomic framework remains with the individual country 
itself.
