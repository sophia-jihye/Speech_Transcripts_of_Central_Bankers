I J Macfarlane: Economic opportunities and risks over the coming decades 
Talk by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to 2003 Melbourne Institute 
Economic and Social Outlook Conference Dinner, Melbourne,13 November 2003. 
 In  keeping with  the  theme  of  this  year’s conference,  I  have chosen  a  subject which has  a long-run 
focus. No doubt this will disappoint some who were hoping that I would deal with the ‘here and now’ of 
Australian monetary policy. But I should point out that within the last week or so we have put out both 
a  press  release  and  a  detailed  quarterly  report  on  monetary  policy  and  in  a  few  weeks  time  I  will 
appear before a Parliamentary Committee for three hours of grilling on the same subject. I think we 
keep the public well informed on the evolution of our thinking on monetary policy, and therefore do not 
feel the need to deal with it every time I speak in public. 
My talk tonight will bear a family resemblance to the talk I gave 18 months ago at the first of these 
conferences  jointly  organised  by  the  Melbourne  Institute  and  The  Australian  newspaper.  As  in  that 
talk, my approach will be to start with the world and work back to Australia’s place in it. I should say at 
the outset that I have always been an optimist when I consider Australia’s place in the world. That is, I 
think that the opportunities before us outnumber the risks and I think that Australia is in a much better 
position than nearly all of the other countries I could name. It does not mean that success will fall in 
our  lap  -  we  will  still  have  to  make  a  lot  of  hard  decisions,  many  of  which  will  not  be  particularly 
popular, but this will be nothing new. 
Optimism is not the normal Australian position when viewing our place in the world. There has been an 
abiding  gloominess  amongst  most  observers  who  were  pre-occupied  with  the  view  that  we  as  a 
country were slipping down the international rankings, and that this would continue. This pessimism 
was particularly rife in the 1980s, re-emerged briefly during the ‘tech boom’, but fortunately there is 
less  of  it  now.  The  fact  that  we  have  had  more  than  a  decade  of  good  economic  performance, 
notwithstanding a difficult international environment at times, has helped build confidence in our ability 
to make our way in the world. 
Let  me  say  a  few  words  about  international  rankings.  There  are  several  organisations  that  publish 
rankings of countries according to income or GDP  per capita. That is, they rank countries from the 
richest down to the poorest. In the past, I have been critical of these rankings because there are so 
many  statistical  assumptions  that  are  involved  in  their  construction  that  the  results  are  very 
approximate,  and  therefore  cannot  form  the  basis  of  policy  interpretation  or  aspiration.  To  illustrate 
this, Table 1 shows the rankings for the year 2000 as calculated by three separate organisations - the 
World Bank, the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and Penn World 
Tables (University of Pennsylvania). As you can see, there is a good deal of similarity between the 
three  rankings,  but  Australia’s  position  is  variously  recorded  as  seventh,  tenth  and  twelfth  out  of 
22 countries.

Notwithstanding  these  reservations,  it  should  be  pointed  out  that  the  period  when  Australia  was 
slipping down the rankings appears to have ended (Table 2). Using the Penn World Tables, Australia 
has moved up from tenth in 1990 to seventh in 2000, while the World Bank numbers show it moving 
up from sixteenth in 1990 to ninth in 2002. I do not wish to make much of this, given my reservations 
about these rankings, but at least it should put a stop to stories about how we are falling behind.

As I said earlier, I think we are well placed for another good performance over the coming decade for 
two broad reasons. 
First,  our  geographic  position.  When  we  look  at  the  major  regions  of  the  world  over  the  past  four 
decades, we note from the right-hand panels of Diagram 1 that both Continental Europe and Japan 
show a distinct downward trend in their growth rates as we move forward from decade to decade. For 
the English-speaking countries, this has not been the case; even though they have not regained the 
growth rates of the 1960s, the three decades after that show, if anything, a slight upward trend. The 
thing that stands out about East Asia is just how fast growth has been in each decade (greater than 
6 per cent per annum), and again there is no sign of a downward trend.

Over any measure, say, 20 years, 10 years or even five years, Asia is the fastest growing region in the 
world, despite what we can now see was a relatively brief setback during the Asian crisis. And there is 
no reason to believe that it will not continue. In fact, there is reason to believe that it will become more 
pronounced. Over the past few decades, a number of smallish Asian countries learned how to grow 
quickly, and now we are seeing the two truly huge countries - China followed by India - achieve the 
same sort of consistent high growth rates.

 A lot of countries are terrified by this, as they see China and India threatening their own industries. 
Other countries see themselves in a position to benefit from this growth, and Australia surely has to be 
one  of  them.  The  potential  benefit  comes  from  the  fact  that  China  and  India  will  not  only  be  large 
exporters, but will be large importers as well. For example, over the past year, Chinese imports rose 
by 40 per cent. 
The countries that are threatened have one or both of the following characteristics: 
• 
they  have  large  manufacturing  sectors,  often  propped  up  with  various  protective  devices; 
and 
they have relatively rigid regulations which make it difficult to shift resources (mainly labour) 
from the declining sectors into the potential growth sectors. 
 Large parts of the world’s manufacturing industry are being effectively transferred to China, so in other 
countries new jobs will have to be found for the people so displaced. The test these countries face is 
whether  they  can  rise  to  the  occasion  or  whether  they  will  simply  try  and  prop  up  yesterday’s 
industries. (As an aside, I am relieved that we are not having to face the coming challenge with the 
sort of heavily protected manufacturing sector and centralised wage system that we had a couple of 
decades ago. I am sure we would have failed the test.) 
My second cause for optimism is related to the first. For most of the 20th century, as the new post-
colonial countries were opened up, there was a massive expansion in the supply of resource-based 
products like the ones we have traditionally produced and exported. In resource-based, I include both 
agricultural  products  and  minerals  and  metals.  The  prices  of  these  products  trended  downwards 
relative  to  the  prices  of  the  things  that  we  tended  to  import  like  manufactures  and  services.  In 
economic parlance, the terms of trade moved against us decade by decade, and this held back the 
growth in our real incomes (Graph 4). Incidentally, this was the principal reason why we slipped down 
the international league table of income per head. 
I think this long trend has at last turned - by my estimate, since about the middle of the 1980s. Now the 
massive expansion in capacity around the world is in manufacturing (mainly Asian manufacturing) and 
the greatest downward pressure on pricing is occurring there. Thus, our export prices are now doing 
better  than  our  import  prices,  and  our  terms  of  trade  has  risen  on  average  over  the  past  15  years 
(Graph 5). The mirror image of this is to be found in China’s terms of trade which has fallen by 30 per 
cent between 1978 and 2001.

  A lot of people would object to this line of reasoning as they would say that I seem to be accepting that 
we will remain a quarry and a farm. That is not true. I thoroughly applaud our success in broadening 
our export base into elaborately transformed manufactures and services, and will have more to say 
about this later. But with the best will in the world, most of our exports will still be resource-based in a 
decade’s time and probably two decades’ time. It has taken 20 years for the resource-based share of 
exports to fall from 70 per cent to 60 per cent, so you can see that change is relatively gradual in this 
area. We should assume that over the next decade or so we will still be a major exporter of resource-
based products, but we should take comfort from the fact that this will not be the disadvantage that it 
once was.

we have a better legal and regulatory infrastructure; 
we have a less-polluted physical environment; and 
a higher proportion of our labour force is skilled. 
What are our advantages and disadvantages? 
Apart from being in the right place and producing the right output, what are our advantages compared 
with other countries? 
First, we should compare ourselves with other developed countries with a similar level of income per 
head; these are mainly European. Compared with this group, I think we have two big advantages - 
flexibility  and  demographics.  Certainly,  our  institutional  framework  in  goods,  labour  and  financial 
markets means we can adjust to change better than virtually all of the European competitors, even if 
we  are  only  on  a  par  with  the  British  and  Canadians,  and  less  flexible  than  the  United  States.  On 
demographics, our population is aging less quickly than virtually any other developed country, thanks 
to our high level of immigration. But even though we are better off than others, we should not delude 
ourselves into thinking that we do not have some big challenges facing us brought about by an aging 
population, a subject to which I will return. 
Second, if we compare ourselves with the countries of Asia, we have three clear advantages: 
• 
• 
• 
Against this, we have less flexibility in the labour market and a more expensive social welfare system. 
While the latter makes for a better and fairer society, it has to be financed by relatively high taxes, a 
combination of factors which means that our savings rate is low by Asian standards. This means that 
we  will  continue  to  rely  on  foreign  savings  to  augment  our  own,  and  hence  we  need  to  remain  an 
attractive place for foreigners to invest. 
Against this background, what should we do to maximise our advantages? First, I think there will be a 
huge premium on flexibility. The countries that can adapt to the emergence of China and India and 
other parts of Asia will thrive, while those that go into defensive mode will stagnate. I think that the 
market by itself will probably do quite a good job of handling the challenge, although at times it may 
need assistance. The main risk is that there will be public pressure put on the Government to prevent 
the changes which may be painful in the short run, but which will be in our long-term interest. 
Secondly, there will be a premium on moving up the skill spectrum. This can be seen most clearly in 
manufacturing where the mass-production of standard items will become dominated by the big Asian 
countries,  and  we  must  find  other  avenues  which  are  opened  up  by  the  possession  of  more 
specialised skills. This is more complicated than it sounds. Some people think that China is only going 
to  dominate  low-tech  things  such  as  textiles,  clothing  and  footwear,  basic  utensils,  consumer 
electronics, etc. But they could dominate a lot more than that; they could dominate anything that can 
be  produced  on  a  large  scale,  even  if  it  is  technologically  sophisticated,  such  as  cars  and  semi-
conductors. What we will need to be good at will be in producing things that are specialised rather than 
mass-produced, skill-intensive and which, in many cases, may be difficult to identify other than by trial 
and error. They will include both manufactured goods and specialised services for export, but will also 
involve  using  the  best  applied  science  available  to  increase  productivity  in  our  traditional  resource-
based  industries  and  in  those  parts  of  the  economy  not  involved  in  international  trade  such  as 
construction or domestic transport. 
There are no short cuts here. The thing we know is that profitable opportunities will only be found if we 
have  a  culture  of  inquiry  and  innovation.  This  in  turn  can  only  happen  if  we  have  a  vigorous 
educational and scientific environment where excellence is valued and rewarded. 
An  illustration  of  this  is  if  we  think  back  to  the  discussions  in  2000  at  the  height  of  the  technology 
boom. There was a widely-held view at that time that the countries that would get ahead were those 
that manufactured IT and telecommunications equipment, and that if you did not do so you would fall 
behind. There was even the suggestion floated in this country that we should entice Intel to open a 
chip factory here. In fact, all the research that has now come to light shows that it is the application of 
the  new  technologies  which  leads  to  the  big  increases  in  productivity,  not  the  manufacture.  In  fact, 
manufacturing  often  takes  place  in  a  huge  foreign-owned  factory,  using  orthodox  mass  production 
techniques, with very little spin-off to the rest of the economy. 
My third theme is demographic. All around the developed world, populations are aging and the growth 
of  working-age  populations  is  slowing  or,  in  some  cases,  falling.  More  retired  people  are  being 
supported by fewer working people. We should be looking ahead and encouraging higher labour force

participation  by  older  workers.  The  Intergenerational  Report  produced  by  the  Government  will  be  a 
very useful document on which to base thinking on policy options. 
If we are not careful, there is a potential for conflict between generations. The young may resent the 
tax burden imposed on them to pay for pension and health expenditure on the old. This will particularly 
be the case if they see the old as owning most of the community’s assets. Housing is the most obvious 
example, where people of my generation have benefited from 30 years of asset price inflation, while 
new entrants to the workforce struggle to buy their first home. 
At the same time, people - retirees in particular - are likely to be feeling less secure as they may be 
disappointed  with  the  rates  of  return  they  are  receiving  on  their  savings.  It  seems  to  me  that  the 
community has not yet come to terms with the fact that nominal rates of return on financial and real 
assets are likely to be much lower over the coming decade or so than over the previous two decades. 
Returns  were  held  up  first  by  inflation  (although,  to  some  extent,  this  was  illusory)  and  then  by  an 
asset  price  boom  that  lasted  from  1983  to  2000  -  the  final  instalment  of  which  reached  bubble 
proportions  in  many  countries.  We  are  presently  witnessing  the  unwinding  of  this  unsustainable 
situation. A good illustration of the long swings in rates of return is illustrated below by the change over 
the past 130 years in real equity prices in the United States. 
Graph 6 
 The  potential  for  intergenerational  conflict  exists  in all  countries,  and  their  future  economic  success 
depends in some sense on how they handle it. The countries that will do worst are those where the 
population  is  aging  the  fastest,  and  those  where  their  governments  have  given  the  most  generous 
promises. Again, we are looking mainly at Europe to find this combination of problems. But even in 
Australia, the conflict could become a problem and lead to all sorts of behavioural changes. At the very 
least,  we  should  question  the  assumption  that  age  and  poverty  are  positively  related  and  that 
concessions to alleviate the latter should be directed at the former. 
In fact, I think we will have to go further and be pre-emptive in conditioning the public, particularly the 
grey-headed part, to accept that policy must be forward looking and directed to ensuring a vigorous 
Australian  economy  and  society  20  years  hence.  This  will  mean  giving  priority  to  tomorrow’s 
working-age population, rather than satisfying the demands of yesterday’s. 
Last time I spoke at this forum, I ended by making a plea for raising the priority attached to improving 
the level of excellence in tertiary education. Although I am not an expert in this subject and was merely 
quoting  others  more  expert  than  myself,  I  was  surprised  at  the  favourable  public  reaction  my 
observations received. I can think of no better way of ending this speech than again stating my view 
BIS Review 49/2003

that an improvement in the quality of tertiary education is probably the best investment we can make in 
our future.
