Jean-Pierre Roth: What to expect from monetary policy? 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the  Swiss 
National  Bank,  at  the  International  Center  for  Monetary  and  Banking  Studies  (ICMB),  Geneva, 
25 November 2003. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 A number of current issues, such as the weakness of the economy and the new National Bank Law, 
raise the question as to what we can expect from monetary policy.  
With  regard  to  the  stability  of  consumer  prices,  the  answer  is  relatively  simple.  The  goal  of  price 
stability is at the very top of the Swiss National Bank’s priority list. Since both inflation and deflation are 
monetary phenomena over the long term, the SNB can and will guarantee price stability in future too.  
Expectations of monetary policy are considerably lower when it comes to regulating economic activity. 
Economic  activity  in  Switzerland  is  strongly  dependent  on  growth  abroad.  Inflation  does  not  bring 
about  long-term  economic  growth.  Stable  prices,  however,  are  the  best  precondition  for  sustained 
growth. A goal of price stability automatically ensures a degree of stability in the economy. Because of 
uncertainty and time lags, however, fine-tuning the economy is an impossible task.  
Speculative  bubbles  in  the  real  estate  and  equity  markets  have  been  an  increasing  source  of 
macroeconomic instability during the past two decades. Although equity and property prices serve as 
important indicators for the future development of economic activity, they are not a goal of monetary 
policy. Many reasons militate against a direct monetary-policy response to changes in asset prices. 
The  question  nevertheless  arises  as  to  whether  monetary  policy  could  not  do  more  to  prevent  any 
speculative bubbles from forming in the first place.
