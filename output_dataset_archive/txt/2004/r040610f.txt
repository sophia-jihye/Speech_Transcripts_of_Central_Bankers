Glenn Stevens: Economic conditions and prospects - June 2004 
Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Committee 
for Economic Development of Australia (Queensland Branch), Brisbane, 2 June 2004. 
 Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. I plan to cover the evolving economic picture both 
abroad  and  at  home.  As  some  of  you  may  know,  the  Bank  released  a  month  ago  our  latest 
comprehensive treatment of the economy and financial markets. The Governor is also due to appear 
in front of a Parliamentary Committee on Friday of this week, to speak on the economy. My remarks 
today, therefore, fit into a rather small window in the unfolding narrative. Accordingly, I will not begin 
any major new lines of inquiry, but mainly give a brief update on a few of the themes which have been 
running for some time. 
The world economy 
It is still the case that the world economy is gaining strength, and forecasts for economic growth have 
generally been moving upwards. According to the main official international bodies (the IMF and the 
OECD),  growth  in  the  world  economy  will  be  about  4½ per  cent  in  both  2004  and  2005.  If  that 
sequence occurs, it will be the strongest two-year growth performance since the late 1970s.  
Of course, these figures are just forecasts, not guarantees of performance. But by this stage of the 
year, it would take something pretty dramatic to change the estimated outcome for 2004 by much. The 
strong  number  for  next  year -  which  is  a  fairly  recent  feature  of  most  people’s  forecasts -  basically 
reflects growing confidence that the recovery is well entrenched. It embodies further solid US growth, 
recognises a marked improvement in economic performance in Japan and ongoing strong growth in 
Asia. Continental Europe is the main area of softness, though even there things seem to be improving 
a bit.  
As  usual,  perceptions  about  the  global  cycle  have  been  heavily  affected  by  the  ebbs  and  flows  of 
confidence  in  the  American  economy.  Following  a somewhat  hesitant  early  phase  of  recovery  from 
early 2002 until mid 2003, the more robust performance of the US through the second half of last year 
and  into  early  2004  has  been  characterised  by  strongly  rising  corporate  profits  and  an  upturn  in 
business investment spending. Over recent months, it has also driven rises in employment levels. This 
was the key sign for which most observers had been waiting, to indicate that the recovery had reached 
the self-sustaining stage, where initial demand expansion has produced enough output growth to push 
up incomes, which in turn feed back into renewed growth in demand. Confirmation of these trends in 
the US has greatly enhanced confidence about the global upswing.

 Once that occurred, it was perhaps inevitable that talk would turn to the question of how much longer 
official interest rates in the US would remain so low. A point that we have made repeatedly is that, in 
thinking about interest rates, it is the level of rates which matters and that level has been extremely 
low in America (and, for that matter, in other major regions or countries like the euro area and Japan). 
A setting such as this, designed to ward off the risks of deflation and chronic weakness in aggregate 
demand, has to give way to more normal settings once it is clear that those dangers are abating. The 
debate the US is going through at present is over when that process of normalisation will start and 
how quickly it will proceed. Market participants are currently betting that it will begin quite soon - within 
the next month - but will proceed fairly gradually. In due course, the Japanese and the Europeans will 
also presumably have such a discussion, though there seems no particular urgency to have it at the 
moment. 
Such an adjustment by the US Fed is unlikely to kill the recovery in US aggregate demand - it is more 
an indication that the Fed thinks the recovery is in solid shape. It would be more worrying if the return 
to normal interest rates in the US were not in prospect.

 That said, there is obviously a period of adjustment in financial markets under way as the anticipated 
changes to the cost of US funds are absorbed. Risk is being re-priced in a wide range of markets. 
Emerging  market  bond  spreads  have  moved  out  a  little,  though  US  domestic  spreads  are  little 
changed. Share prices have softened recently in a number of countries, and especially in Asia. The 
US dollar has firmed against most currencies.  
To a large extent, these movements reflect the unwinding of positions which were prompted by the 
very low US short-term rates and the resulting search for more yield - and more risk - in various other 
2 
 BIS Review 34/2004
asset classes. Such adjustments are to be expected once the period of very low US rates looks like it 
is coming to an end. In fact we should, for the most part, welcome them. On most measures, spreads 
are  still  quite  low  relative  to  historical  norms.  Arguably,  risk  was  being  underpriced  until  recently 
anyway, which is hardly a recipe for longer-run stability. So all in all, a gradual return to a more normal 
constellation of US interest rates should be seen as a good thing.

All of this attention given to the US economy and the changes to global financial markets as a result of 
likely changes in US monetary policy is par for the course. More noteworthy of late, however, is the 
prominence  given  to  the  growing  role  of  China  in  the  world  economy.  China  is  making  a  tangible 
difference to global economic output - and was a key reason, for example, why global output did not 
slow as much as the output of the advanced country group in 2001 and 2002.  
In some quarters, the rise of China as a source of supply of manufactured products on world markets 
has been seen as a cause for concern - since China has such a large supply of low-cost labour, much 
of which has not yet been tapped. No doubt, the rise of China is changing the economics of global 
manufacturing - though it is hardly the first time in history that this kind of thing has occurred. But it is 
also  changing  the economics  of production  of  other  things. China  is  not  just  a  source  of  supply  for 
goods, it is a source of demand for goods and services as well. Indeed, China’s trade surplus with the 
rest of the world is quite small, and relatively stable, suggesting that China has been putting as much 
additional demand as supply into the world economy. 
A  number  of  countries  have  been  affected  by  the  demand  side  of  China’s  expansion,  not  least 
Australia,  where  we  now  see  China  accounting  for  about  10 per  cent  of  our  foreign  trade,  up  from 
5 per cent as recently as 1998. China’s demand for resources to supply its industrial expansion has 
put upward pressure on prices for steel and its raw materials (iron ore, coking coal), and on the costs 
of shipping. These effects have amplified the normal cyclical pick-up caused by general recovery in 
the industrial economies around the world. The Australian resource sector might have been able to 
supply  even  more  of  this  demand  had  more  capacity  been  available,  but  constraints  seem  to  have 
been binding in some areas (which, of course, is one reason the effect on prices has been so strong). 
Presumably  there  are  good  prospects  for  expanding  investment  in  various  parts  of  the  resources 
sector in the years ahead.  
The rapid growth of China’s demand for energy has also surely had a tangible impact on oil prices. 
While there are apparently some short-term special factors at work in the most recent very high oil 
prices, the trend increase in the global demand for oil is now strongly influenced by China (and other 
rapidly growing countries in Asia), as shown in the chart below. The figures which put this trend at its 
most stark are as follows. Over the two years to March this year, global demand for oil rose by about 
4 million barrels a day. About 1.5 million barrels of this came from the OECD countries as a group - 
BIS Review 34/2004

who use over 60 per cent of supply. About 2.1 million barrels a day in additional demand came from 
Asia including India, with 1.5 million barrels of that from China alone.1

 Now  it  is  important  to  keep  the  recent  rise  in  oil  prices  in  perspective:  it  is  nothing  like  as  large  in 
proportionate terms as occurred in the “OPEC” shocks of 1973 and 1979. The level of real oil prices 
remains much lower than in either of those episodes and the share of oil in total production costs for 
advanced economies is much lower than it was in those days.

 However, given the extent of Chinese and Asian demand generally, and their likely trend growth in the 
future, it seems entirely possible that the level of real oil prices of the 1990s will turn out to have been 
on the low side of what could be the norm in the future.  
More generally, we can see a quite important change in relative prices occurring associated with the 
rise of China: prices for many manufactured goods are declining relative to those of resources. As a 
supplier  of  resources  and  a  consumer  of  manufactures,  Australia  benefits  from  this  relative  price 
change. No-one can say for sure, of course, whether it will continue for a long time, but it does appear 
to  be  in  distinct  contrast  to  the  previous  long-term  downward  trend  in  Australia’s  terms  of  trade.

Certainly, it is beyond serious dispute now that the weight of China in the world economy - both in its 
secular growth rate, and the dynamic of its business cycle - is something which has to be carefully 
considered.  
China has problems, of course - as with any country trying to industrialise rapidly, balancing the rapid 
growth in demand and supply, and avoiding other problems, is no easy task. Right now the Chinese 
authorities are attempting to moderate the economy’s growth rate, given clear signs of overheating. 
Some of those pessimistic about global prospects in 2005 worry that the slowdown will turn out to be 
abrupt. The fact that China has had a very large build-up in credit, and that its banks carry the legacy 
of decades of lending to state enterprises on non-commercial criteria, make the job harder. Equally, 
the authorities have for the past decade shown an impressive capacity to manage the economy quite 
successfully  through  some  difficult  times.  Hence,  while  there  is  some  risk  of  a  slump  in  China,  we 
should not assume it. Even if an unexpectedly large slowdown did occur, it would be very unlikely to 
change  the  long-run  outlook  for  China  of  strong  growth  and  continuing  emergence  as  one  of  the 
world’s largest economies.  
I  haven’t  even  mentioned  India  yet  but  one  should  mention  it,  as  an  economy  with  a  very  large 
population, and turning out quite strong growth rates over the past few years. We will be hearing a lot 
more about India’s impact on the global scene during this decade.  
The Australian economy 
The Australian economy has continued grow. In the second half of 2003, real GDP expanded at an 
annualised pace of over 5 per cent, as the farm sector gained ground on the back of better climatic 
conditions, and the non-farm economy continued to expand, helped by strong domestic spending and 
the early stage of a recovery in exports.  
It was unlikely that growth at that pace would persist, and according to figures released earlier today, 
the  speed  of  growth  early  in  2004  was  noticeably  more  moderate.  A  range  of  business  surveys 
suggest that conditions experienced in the first four or five months of 2004, while as strong as those of 
late 2003, were nonetheless better than average.  
Consumer demand is not advancing at the same pace this year as it did in the second half of 2003, 
though  tax  reductions  in  the  coming  year  will  presumably  offer  support  to  consumer  spending. 
Employment has continued to rise, and the rate of unemployment is at its lowest for over 20 years. 
While  employment  growth  last  year  owed  a  good  deal  to  the  effects  of  high  levels  of  residential 
construction and the associated demand for materials, of late it looks as though employment in some 
of the professional services sectors has begun to increase again, after a slower period since mid 2001. 
Hence, as the anticipated decline in dwelling construction takes shape this year, overall employment 
levels should continue to increase, even if at a reduced pace from that seen over recent months.  
Growth in the state of Queensland, in particular, has been very strong indeed over the past year, and 
much faster than for the nation as a whole. Consumer spending is recorded as having grown by over 
8 per  cent  through  2003,  compared  with  5 per  cent  for  the  rest  of  Australia.  Dwelling  investment 
spending surged to an all-time high in Queensland at the end of last year, while for the rest of the 
country it was high, but no higher than the pre-GST peak in 2000. Employment growth has also been 
faster in the sunshine State than in virtually all the other states.

Queensland  has,  of  course,  the  highest  rate  of  population  growth  of  any  of  the  states,  with  net 
migration from Victoria and NSW in particular. So we would expect most aggregates to be rising faster 
than elsewhere, but in 2003 growth in spending per head still outstripped the rest of Australia, and the 
employment growth sufficiently exceeded growth in the labour force that Queensland’s unemployment 
rate - which is routinely higher than the national average - closed quite a bit of the gap to the other 
States. In short, Queensland had a pretty good year.

The housing market has been a key issue for the economy over the past couple of years and, as you 
would know, the RBA has had quite a bit to say about it. A misconception that we still see from time to 
time  is  that  some  people  seem  to  think  we  have  been  concerned  mainly  about  excessive  rates  of 
construction. Construction has been very strong, and there may be over-supply in some areas. But our 
main concern has not been about the addition of 130,000 to 150,000 new dwellings each year. Rather 
we have been worried by the market for the existing 7½ million dwellings and the way in which they 
were changing hands for higher and higher prices, with an associated build-up in debt levels. That is, 
we  have  been  worried  about  the  housing  market  as  an  asset  market,  and  about  the  borrowing 
behaviour of participants in that market. The concern was not out of a desire to target house prices, 
but more over the potential risks to macroeconomic stability from a major boom - and possible bust - in 
the household sector’s main asset class.  
On the most recent readings, there has been a distinct softening in most of the major housing markets, 
with more than one data series showing an outright fall in prices in the March quarter in several cities. 
This  was  associated  with  a  decline  in  the  demand  for  credit,  though  on  the  most  recent  data  that 
demand still seems very strong. House prices in Brisbane and the Gold Coast declined a little on these 
measures, though not by as much as those further south.

 In  our  judgement,  this  is  a  welcome  development.  While  various  fundamental  reasons  can  be 
advanced for dwelling prices to have risen noticeably in the 1990s, it was hard to avoid the conclusion 
that strong speculative forces were at work over the past couple of years. That was not a healthy state 
of affairs and the sooner it passed, the better.  
It is just about impossible, of course, to predict with any precision how all of this will unfold from here. 
Much will depend on what else is occurring in the economy. In individual cases, the extent of leverage 
will be very important. My own view is that the palpable sense of disappointment being felt by many 
leveraged  investors  in  residential  property  is  likely  to  grow  further  for  the  next  year  or  so,  possibly 
longer. For many owner-occupiers, on the other hand, a moderate decline in prices should not create 
major discomfort, in an environment of ongoing growth in employment and wages, as well as reduced 
taxes. In fact, it is hard to imagine a much more benign backdrop for the aftermath of an asset and 
credit boom than one where growth in employment and income is continuing, the world economy is 
picking up and the Australian economy is relatively free of other domestic imbalances.  
Even so, we anticipate that housing market developments will be a factor at work in reducing the rapid 
pace  of  growth  in  domestic  spending  to  something  more  moderate.  Rising  house  prices  and  the 
capacity  to  collateralise  the  higher  wealth  has  accommodated  a  rise  in  consumption  which  has 
consistently outpaced  the  rise  in  income  over several  years.  In  a world where dwelling prices  have 
stopped  rising  and  even  declined  somewhat,  perceptions  of  ongoing  rapid  increases  in  wealth  are 
presumably  now  in  the  process  of  dissipating.  This  will  weaken  positive  wealth  effects,  and  could 
possibly lead to a partial reversal in time. On the other hand, the earlier increases in dwelling prices 
were very large, and even with the latest data showing declines, a big cumulative rise in wealth has 
occurred  over  the  past  decade,  most  of  which  has  not  been  tapped.  So  there  may  yet  be  some 
expansionary impetus in the pipeline from those earlier gains.

 The  net  effect  is  therefore  hard  to  judge,  but  on  balance,  we  are  inclined  to  think  that  consumer 
demand will grow more in line with income over the next year or two - that is, by something less than 
last year’s cracking pace. That, together with some decline in dwelling construction activity, will result 
in slower growth in overall domestic spending. 
With  the  world  economy  doing  quite  well,  on  the  other  hand,  external  demand  is  expected  to  be 
stronger -  the  international  environment  will  be  boosting  Australia,  rather  than  restraining  it.  It  is 
encouraging that this picture seems, slowly, to be emerging in the available data. Risks to this outlook 
stemming from a rising Australian dollar have abated somewhat of late. The result then is expected to 
be good growth overall, and more balanced growth (as between external and domestic demand) than 
seen for some time.  
Inflation will be affected over the period ahead by the fluctuations in the exchange rate and oil prices, 
but most likely will be consistent with our 2-3 per cent medium-term target. Internationally, the scene 
has turned (in the space of only twelve months) from one of concern about deflation to one of inflation 
going higher. Fears of widespread deflation were, in my view, always a little overdone, and the swing 
in some quarters to fear of inflation might also be unduly pessimistic. Nonetheless, it seems we are in 
a new phase of the international cycle and these developments will bear close watching. At this stage 
for Australia, though, prospects seem to be for acceptable inflation performance over the coming year 
or so. I will leave further elaboration of the Bank’s view of the outlook, since the Governor will do this 
on Friday. 
Conclusion 
Overall,  this  is  a  pretty  positive  picture  for  the  Australian  economy.  “Beautiful  one  day,  perfect  the 
next” would perhaps be an overstatement. But generally good economic conditions offer, I trust, ample 
opportunity for profitable enterprise on the part of CEDA members and others here in Queensland. I 
wish you every success.
