Lars Nyberg: The mortgage market from a Riksbank perspective 
Speech  by  Mr  Lars  Nyberg,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  The  Swedish  Bankers’ 
Association’s Annual Bank Meeting 2004, Stockholm, 11 November 2004. 
 First  and  foremost,  thank  you  for  the  invitation  to  speak  at  the  bank  meeting  today.  The  mortgage 
market is the focus of today’s meeting and I will discuss this market from a Riksbank perspective. But 
what is that exactly? The Riksbank’s remit is to conduct monetary policy in such a way that leads to 
stable  prices,  but  also  to  promote  stability  and  efficiency  in  the  payment  system.  For  both  of  these 
tasks, the situation in the mortgage market since the mid-1990s, with increasing household debt and 
rising  housing  prices,  has  been  of  great  interest.  Is  this  development  sustainable?  And  if  not,  what 
should be done? Incidentally, we share these issues with a number of other countries in the Western 
world. 
I intend to begin with a brief reminder of how we arrived at this situation. Then I will discuss the risks to 
financial stability. Finally I will give my views on the possible implications for the inflation target and 
monetary policy. 
Housing prices and debt 
Since 1996 house prices have risen by just over 80 per cent in current prices. Swedish household debt 
has  increased  by  85  per  cent  over  the  same  period  (Figure  1).  Household  debt  in  relation  to 
disposable incomes is now at the same level as just before the banking crisis at the beginning of the 
1990s, just over 120 per cent. The bulk of households’ loans have in various ways been secured on 
homes. 
A number of factors can help to explain this development. In the housing market the supply of new 
apartments  has  been  low  since  1993  (Figure  2).  In  the  centres  of  the  major  Swedish  cities,  where 
prices  have  risen  most,  it  is  difficult  to  build  homes  at  all.  Meanwhile,  demand  has  picked  up  as  a 
result of robust growth in households’ incomes. Disposable incomes have risen by 35 per cent since 
1995, measured  in current  prices.  Moreover,  migration  to  the big  cities  has  boosted  demand  in  the 
very areas where the supply is most limited. During the IT boom, the demand pressure in Stockholm 
was  high,  which  was  reflected  in  prices.  When  the  equity  market  and  particularly  technology 
companies dropped in value, prices in Stockholm stagnated, but they continued to rise in Gothenburg 
and Malmö. 
In  the  credit  market,  falling  interest  rates  have  of  course  increased  demand  and  made  households 
more inclined to borrow. Households may also be borrowing more because they are less uncertain 
than  before about  how  interest rates  and  inflation  will  develop.  The  future  seems  more  predictable, 
which should increase the willingness to borrow at each given interest rate level. Since the mid-1990s 
we have gone from a period of high, fluctuating inflation to low and stable inflation. If this has boosted 
loan demand, the successful policy of inflation targeting has been partly responsible. But so far this is 
just a hypothesis. 
It is important, however, for households to feel certain about how large their future payments will be. 
An  international  comparison  suggests  that  household  demand  for  home  loans  depends on  how  the 
market is structured and particularly on the availability of instruments for households to manage their 
interest rate risk. Demand mounts in line with the opportunity to manage risk. In the United States and 
Denmark, households can fix the interest rates on their mortgages for long periods and also refinance 
these fixed-rate loans at a reasonable cost should interest rates fall. In Denmark, households’ debt 
ratio is more than 180 per cent, compared with 120 per cent for Swedish households. This is despite 
the fact that the country has roughly the same proportion of homeowners as Sweden. 
The supply of mortgages has increased, too. According to the new capital adequacy rules, Basel II, 
mortgages  will  be  given  a  lower  risk-weighting  than  today,  which  means  that  banks’  capital 
requirements  will  be  lower  if  they  hold a  large  proportion  of  mortgages.  The adjustment  to  this  has 
started already, thus toughening the competition and depressing lending rates. Households have also 
become  an  increasingly  important  borrower  group  for  the  major  Swedish  banks.   Lending  to 
households now comprises a little more than 40 per cent of the banks’ total lending.

As  a  representative  of  the  Riksbank,  I  have  reason  to  be  positive  about  the  increasing  competition 
since it improves efficiency in the market. Perhaps there is cause to hope that the competition in the 
future will also give rise to new instruments with which households can manage their interest rate risk. 
Here I think that the developments have much to offer. 
The factors discussed above, which affect supply and demand in the housing market and mortgage 
market,  go  a  long  way  towards  explaining  the  developments  in  both  housing  prices  and  household 
borrowing. This is not the case in all countries. In the markets where prices have risen sharpest, for 
example in Australia, the UK, Spain and Ireland, it is also very common to see housing as a financial 
asset, as opposed to somewhere the buyer intends to live. These countries have so-called buy-to-let 
markets, which involves buying a second house or apartment with a view to letting it. Buyers hope that 
the property will rise in value in much the same way as a share, yielding a return in the process. In 
Dublin the situation has got to the stage where rents have dropped in recent years, which should have 
resulted in falling house prices. But prices have continued to climb. 
It  is  likely  that  a  number  of  markets  contain  elements  of  a  speculative  bubble,  where  price 
developments bear no relation to the fundamental factors that normally affect supply and demand and 
instead are driven by expectations of future price increases. Commercial property prices in Sweden at 
the beginning of the 1990s gave us a clear example of how such a market works. 
In Sweden we don’t see any indications that speculation is of any great significance for the formation 
of housing prices. I think there’s reason to wonder whether such imbalances really can arise in the 
Swedish market. Swedish people live in their houses or apartments. Perhaps the Swedish tax system, 
both as regards property tax and tax on rental income, has made it unprofitable for households to buy 
to let. Australia, for example, has considerably more favourable tax rules. 
So, to sum up, it seems that both housing prices and household borrowing in Sweden are fairly well 
explained by the fundamental factors that usually govern supply and demand. This doesn’t mean of 
course that prices cannot fall; far from it. Uncertainty about income developments and rising interest 
rates  could,  for  example,  curb  demand  at  the  same  time  as  the  supply  increases  when  the 
construction of new homes picks up. In that case we should expect weaker price increases or even a 
drop  in  prices.  But  the  prices  shouldn’t  fall  as  much  or  as  fast  as  when  demand  contains  obvious 
elements of speculation. 
Financial stability 
So  what  is  the  outlook  for  the  stability  of  the  Swedish  banking  system?  What  would  happen  if 
unemployment or interest rates were to rise? Would we see a fast increase in the banks’ loan losses 
as during the banking crisis? 
We  have  concluded  in  several  financial  stability  reports  that  there  indeed  is  cause  for  vigilance  as 
regards  developments  in  household  debt,  but  that  we  don’t  believe  that  these  developments  are  a 
threat to the stability of the banking system. There are several reasons for this. 
One  is  that  just  mentioned,  namely  that  we  don’t  see  any  obvious  speculative  tendencies  in  the 
housing market, perhaps because households in Sweden don’t have that great an incentive to regard 
houses and apartments as financial assets. 
Another reason, which is connected with the first, is quite simply that so far households have never 
caused  the  banks  such  losses  that  could  threaten  financial  stability.  During  the  crisis  years  at  the 
beginning  of  the  1990s,  the  household  sector’s  total  loan  losses  were  at  most  0.7  per  cent  of  the 
banks’ total lending to that sector. This corresponded to only 7 per cent of the total loan losses. Unlike 
companies,  households  can’t  go  into  bankruptcy  and  shake  off  their  debts  (Figure  3).  It  wasn’t  the 
housing market but the market for commercial property that caused the major losses in the banking 
system. And this time commercial property prices, instead of shooting up, have actually fallen. 
A third reason is that households’ ability to service debt has not deteriorated at the same rate as their 
debt  has  increased.  Households  pay  much  less  for  their  loans  today  than  at  the  beginning  of  the 
1990s  and  therefore  can  afford  to  take  on  larger  debt.  In  the  early  1990s  households’  interest 
payments comprised around 10 per cent of their disposable incomes, while they only constitute 4 per 
cent today (Figure 4).

 BIS Review 67/2004
Households’  assets  have  also  increased  in  value.  Since  the  mid-1990s  the  value  of  households’ 
financial assets - equities, bonds and other savings - has risen by about 70 per cent. And this has 
occurred despite the price decline in the equity market. 
All in all, households’ debts have increased at more or less the same rate as their assets (Figure 5). 
This development could be seen as satisfactory from the point of view of stability because households 
don’t  need  to  rely  on  their  incomes  only;  they  also  have  assets that  they  can  realise  and pay  their 
debts with if necessary. 
We base our regular analyses on data for the household sector as a whole. However, it’s not certain 
that  individual,  indebted  households  also have  enough  income or assets.  To  make sure of  this, we 
took a closer look last spring at the indebtedness and the ability to service debt of different income 
groups, based on data for 2000 and 2001. Our findings were the same as for the entire sector as a 
borrower  group  -  the  debt  was  mainly  held  by  the  same  group  of  households  that  had  assets  and 
sizable  incomes.  The  group  of  households  that  had  narrow  financial  margins  were  a  fairly 
miscellaneous group, but most of the households were debt-free. We will be updating this study with 
data for 2002 in the next Financial Stability Report, to be published at the beginning of December. 
So it doesn’t appear likely that households as a group would run into payment difficulties in the event 
of an unexpected rise in interest rates or a decrease in incomes due to increased unemployment. And 
even if households should encounter considerable difficulties, it would not have any significant impact 
on the banks’ risk capital. As I see it today, the issue of housing prices and household borrowing is not 
a question that affects the stability of the Swedish banking system. 
It  should  be  pointed  out,  however,  that  even  though  the  risk  to  households  as  a  group  is  small, 
individual households could be hit hard if their margins to cope with rising interest rates are narrow or 
if they suffer a loss of income in some shape or form. It’s important therefore that the banks ensure 
that their borrowers are well capable of coping with higher interest rates. 
Price stability 
That both assets and debts are increasing in relation to incomes does, however, make households 
more  sensitive  to  changes  in  interest  rates  and  asset  prices.  A  hike  in  interest  rates  would  directly 
affect  households’  purchasing  power,  especially  given  that  households  are  increasingly  taking 
variable-rate loans. A drop in house prices would also reduce their wealth. 
So, should interest rates rise and housing prices fall, it would have a bigger impact than before on 
households’ purchasing power, and thereby probably on consumption and saving as well. This brings 
me to the connection to price stability. 
Now  and  again  we  hear  concerns  in  the  public  domain  about  the  effects  that  households’  higher 
sensitivity  to  interest  rates  and  asset  prices  could  have  on  future  consumption  and  thereby  on 
economic developments in general. Several voices have called for monetary policy to be more attuned 
to  this.  Shouldn’t  interest  rates  be  raised  to  curtail  a  build-up  of debt  and  a rise  in housing  prices? 
Should housing prices fall rapidly, might not demand and thus inflation be affected in a way that is not 
taken account of in the Riksbank’s forecasts? And, looking somewhat further ahead, might it not have 
a real economic impact that the Riksbank would also have reason to take into consideration? 
These highly legitimate questions are often based on concerns that some kind of speculative bubble 
has been blown up, in much the same way as in the commercial property market in the early 1990s or 
in the equity market ten years later. 
Let me first address the question of the forecasts. Debt levels and developments in housing prices are 
taken  into  account  in  the  Riksbank’s  forecast  of  future  inflation  through  their  effects  on  household 
wealth and thereby on demand in the economy. It is difficult of course to predict how households will 
act,  but  we  usually  assume  that  they  are  rational  and  able  to  make  sound  judgements  of  how  the 
economy will develop and how this will affect their borrowing costs. This is not necessarily a correct 
assumption. For example, it’s conceivable that households in certain situations would react stronger to 
a rate hike than to an equivalent rate cut. Should households not expect interest rates to rise in an 
economic  upturn  and  a  rate  hike  by  the  Riksbank  came  as  something  of  a  surprise,  it  could  have 
effects  on consumption  beyond  those  predicted  in  our  models. We  discuss  these  effects and  try  to 
take account of them outside our models to the extent that we believe it is justified. Were households 
to react stronger than expected, it could mean that we don’t need to raise interest rates as quickly in 
an economic upswing as we otherwise would have done.

The question of the real economic effects beyond the forecast horizon is trickier. When a speculative 
bubble  bursts,  it  can  result  in  rapid  price  falls,  but  also  in  poorer  economic  growth  and  higher 
unemployment in the longer-term. Naturally, this is something we want to avoid if possible. 
How the risk of rapid price falls in general and of speculative bubbles in particular should be dealt with 
in the context of monetary policy is not an altogether simple question, however. But, as I mentioned, 
there doesn’t seem to be any significant elements of speculation in housing prices. Consequently the 
bubble problem is somewhat hypothetical for us. I see no reason from a real economic perspective to 
depart from our normal rule of monetary policy on account of households’ debt levels. Furthermore it 
seems that the price situation has stabilised and in some locations prices are even easing. 
Concluding remarks 
The high debt levels of Swedish households and rising housing prices give cause for the Riksbank to 
be  vigilant.  There  is  no  doubt  about  that.  But  there  are  no  signs  that  the  stability  of  the  payment 
system is threatened or that price stability in any way is jeopardised by the rise that we have seen so 
far in households’ mortgage debt. 
Individual households should also be vigilant. For some time now nominal and real interest rates have 
been low owing to weaker economic activity and low inflation. However, as economic activity picks up, 
inflation  should  accelerate  and  interest  rates  rise.  Interest  costs  will  increase.  Interest  rate  hikes 
should also mean that housing prices will not rise as rapidly as has been the case so far. 
I imagine that we all welcome the fact that inflation has come down to its currently low, stable level. 
For borrowers it has meant lower interest costs, but the other side of the coin is that they will not be 
able to amortise their debt solely through the effect of inflation. Their loans will take longer to pay off, 
which could entail the liability side of their balance sheet remaining unchanged while perhaps lower 
housing prices reduce the value of their assets. 
Many  households  also  appear  to  be  postponing  amortisation  of  their  loans,  which  seems  like  a 
short-term decision. Perhaps some households need to think about taking a longer-term approach in 
their loan decisions. Estimates of borrowing costs must also hold up when interest rates rise or when 
the value of the purchased house no longer does. 
Thank you.
