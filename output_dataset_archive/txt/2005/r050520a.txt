 Introduction 
Monetary policy is aimed at maintaining price stability. That may seem self-evident. Thirty years ago it 
was  not.  From  the  end  of  the  second  world  war  until  the  mid  to  late  1970s,  the  majority  view  of 
academic  economists  and  policy-makers  alike  was  that  monetary  policy  had  rather  little  to  do  with 
inflation, and was largely ineffective as an instrument of demand management.1 The intellectual basis 
for  that  view  was  never  clear.  And  painful  experience  taught  us  that  price  instability  led  to  costly 
fluctuations  in  real  output  and  employment.  Far  from  being  ineffective,  a  monetary  policy  aimed  at 
price stability has proved to be the key to successful management of aggregate demand. Fortunately, 
the theory and practice of monetary policy in the UK have changed out of all recognition in the past 
twenty-five years.2 We have moved from the Great Inflation to the Great Stability.  
The story of monetary policy in Britain during the intervening period is told by the Mais Lectures. The 
first  Mais  Lecture  was  delivered  by  my  predecessor,  Lord  Richardson,  in  1978,  at  a  point  when 
monetary policy was emerging as the main tool to deal with inflation. Not before time, you might think, 
since  only  two  years  earlier  inflation  had  reached  27%.  In  1981  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer, 
Geoffrey Howe, chose as the title of his Mais Lecture: “The Fight Against Inflation”. As he said then, 
with  inflation  still  in  double  figures,  "squeezing  inflation  out  from  an  economy  which  has  become 
accustomed  to  higher  rates  over  a  period  of  years  cannot  be  an  easy  or  painless  task.  …  the 
inflationary mentality must be eradicated. … When we have done that we will find that low inflation or 
even price stability need not be painful". The conquest of inflation was to prove harder than expected. 
In the decade that followed Geoffrey Howe’s lecture, inflation averaged over 7% a year. Only since 
1992 has inflation fallen to levels that could be described as price stability. 
In retrospect, two Mais Lectures seem to have been of particular significance: those by Nigel Lawson 
in  1984  and  by  Tony  Blair,  then  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  ten  years  ago  this  month.  Despite  clear 
differences of view, what stand out from those two lectures are their similarities. Both emphasised the 
need  for  a  medium-term  framework  for  monetary  and  fiscal  policy.  Over  twenty-five  years  we  have 
moved from monetary targets to an inflation target and from a medium term financial strategy to rules 
for fiscal policy over the cycle. Yet the essential objective of maintaining monetary and fiscal discipline 
remains the same. All major political parties in the UK now agree that stability is the key to economic 
success. 
We do not know whether the Great Stability will continue, as it has for more than a decade now. In 
part,  it  will  depend  upon  whether  our  framework  of  inflation  targeting  can  respond  to  the  economic 
shocks  that  will  undoubtedly  be  visited  upon  us  in  the  years  ahead.  And  that  is  the  subject  of  my 
lecture. In only fifteen years inflation targeting has taken the central banking world by storm. Table 1 
shows  that  there  are  now  22  countries  in  which  monetary  policy  is  based  on  an  inflation  targeting 
regime. So tonight I want to discuss what inflation targeting really means, why it has been successful 
in Britain and elsewhere, and what challenges it faces in the years ahead.  
The  lecture  tries  to  answer  three  questions.  First,  what  can  monetary  policy  do  and  how  has  our 
understanding  of  that  changed  over  time?  Second,  what  are  the  challenges  for  central  banks  that 
result  from  incomplete  knowledge  of  the  transmission  mechanism  of  monetary  policy?  Third,  is 
inflation targeting the answer to those challenges? I believe that it is. Inflation targeting, I shall argue,

is  the  natural  way  to  conduct  policy  when  there  is  a  great  deal  about  its  effects  that  we  do  not 
understand.  The  practice  of  monetary  policy  must  recognise  that  monetary  theory  will  continue  to 
evolve. That is why my lecture is subtitled: practice ahead of theory. 
What can monetary policy do? 
In  practice,  monetary  policy  means  setting  the  level  of  the  official  interest  rate  at  which  the  central 
bank deals with the banking system.3 But ideas about how interest rates should be set, and with what 
objective, have been subject to radical changes since the 1970s. Let me give three examples. None is 
new; the subject has moved on. I give them to show that monetary policy operates against an ever-
changing backdrop of ideas about the way the economy works, a theme that lies at the heart of my 
lecture. 
First, it is now widely accepted that there is no long-run trade-off between output and inflation. Both 
theory  –  following  Friedman  and  Phelps  –  and  practice  –  particularly  in  the  1970s  –  showed  that 
permanently higher inflation does not bring faster growth or higher employment, and may well reduce 
both. But in the post-war period views were different. In 1959 the Radcliffe Report on the Workings of 
the  Monetary  System  seemed  to  support  the  idea  of  a  permanent  trade-off.  The  objectives  of 
monetary policy included, it argued, “a high and stable level of employment” and “reasonably stability 
of the internal purchasing power of money”. But it went on, “…there are serious possibilities of conflict 
between them.”4
Second, the rate of inflation in the long run is determined by monetary policy, not by microeconomic 
factors. Again, that is now taken for granted, but much effort was devoted to the imposition of detailed 
direct  wage  and  price  controls  in  the  1960s  and  1970s.  Nicholas  Kaldor,  adviser  to  Harold  Wilson, 
wrote in 1971 that “It is also far more generally acknowledged – even by Conservative Prime Ministers 
– that the process of inflation is 'cost-induced' and not demand-induced', with the evident implication 
that it can be tackled only by an incomes policy'”. Not many Whitehall advisers would give that answer 
today.  
Third, in the short run monetary policy does affect output and employment and so has the potential to 
be  an  effective  stabilisation  tool.  Reflecting  a  post-war  consensus  that  monetary  policy  was  rather 
ineffective, however, the Radcliffe Report concluded that “…. there can be no reliance on this weapon 
[interest  rate  policy]  as  a  major  short-term  stabiliser  of  demand”5  It  is  now  accepted  that  monetary 
policy lies at the heart of any attempt to stabilise the economy.  
The source of monetary policy’s influence over output and employment lies in frictions, which mean 
that prices and wages do not adjust instantaneously to clear markets whenever demand and supply 
are  out of  balance.  Firms change  prices  only  irregularly  in  response  to changes  in  demand;  wages 
adjust only slowly as labour market conditions alter; and expectations are updated only slowly as new 
information  is  received.  Such  frictions  generate  short-run  relationships  between  money,  activity  and 
inflation.6 The nature of frictions goes right to the heart of the policy debate over inflation targeting. 
From  time  to  time  shocks  will  move  inflation  away  from  its  desired  long-run  level,  and  the  policy 
question is how quickly should it be brought back to that level. There is no right or wrong answer to 
that  question.  Only  an  analysis  of  the  nature  of  the  relevant  frictions  tells  us  what  is  the  “optimal” 
monetary policy. 7
                                                      
3   For many years there was a debate about whether policy was better seen as setting short-term interest rates or determining 
the monetary base. That is no longer an issue. For some time, the demand for money has been purely demand-determined. 
As a result, central banks can set the short-term interest rate either to influence real interest rates or to determine the path 
of the monetary base or a broader monetary aggregate. Money remains at the heart of the transmission mechanism but 
since its velocity is unstable most central banks use interest rates as their instrument rather than a monetary aggregate.

In a deep sense, only a complete understanding of the nature of the frictions makes it possible to decide on the objectives of 
monetary policy. Woodford (2003) and others discuss the link between that fundamental analysis and the proposition that 
monetary policy should aim to stabilise inflation and output.

That is why recent academic analysis portrays monetary policy as a “policy reaction function” which 
describes the reaction of the official short-term interest rate to any possible configuration of economic 
shocks that might arise in future. For a given model of frictions it is possible to derive the appropriate 
policy  reaction  function  which  most  advances  the  objectives  of  the  policy-makers.  Such  a  reaction 
function is a state-contingent monetary policy rule. It describes policy in every situation. There are no 
exceptions and, by construction, the rule does not change over time.  
Monetary  policy  rules  have  become  a  major  area  of  research.8  Perhaps  the  most  famous  is  the 
so-called  Taylor  rule,  named  after  John  Taylor  who  has  just  returned  to  Stanford  after  serving  as 
Under Secretary at the US Treasury. The Taylor rule implies that interest rates should rise if inflation is 
above its target and output is above its trend level, and fall when the converse is true. The path along 
which inflation should return to its desirable long-run level will therefore vary according to the state of 
the economy. 
A key motivation for the study of monetary policy rules was the insight that if economic agents base 
their decisions on expectations of the future then the way monetary policy is expected to be conducted 
in the future affects economic outcomes today. Hence it is very important to think about how policy 
influences the expectations of the private sector. Consider a simple and stark example. Suppose that 
a central bank managed to control inflation perfectly by responding to all shocks instantaneously. The 
outcome  would  be  a  constant  inflation  rate.  Households  and  firms  would  know  that  potential 
movements  in  inflation  would  never  emerge  because  all  future  shocks  would  be  instantly  offset  by 
changes in interest rates. Interest rates would change with no apparent link to or effect on inflation. To 
an observer – whether journalist or econometrician – interest rate changes would appear to have little 
to do with inflation. The central bank would appear to be behaving almost randomly. But that inference 
would be false. Indeed, if people did expect the central bank to behave randomly, then the behaviour 
of households and firms would change and inflation would no longer be stable.  
This  is  what  I  call  the  Maradona  theory  of  interest  rates.  The  great  Argentine  footballer,  Diego 
Maradona, is not usually associated with the theory of monetary policy. But his performance against 
England in the World Cup in Mexico City in June 1986 when he scored twice is a perfect illustration of 
my  point.  Maradona’s  first  “hand  of  God”  goal  was  an  exercise  of  the  old  “mystery  and  mystique” 
approach to central banking. His action was unexpected, time-inconsistent and against the rules. He 
was lucky to get away with it. His second goal, however, was an example of the power of expectations 
in the modern theory of interest rates. Maradona ran 60 yards from inside his own half beating five 
players  before  placing  the  ball  in  the  English  goal.  The  truly  remarkable  thing,  however,  is  that, 
Maradona ran virtually in a straight line. How can you beat five players by running in a straight line? 
The answer is that the English defenders reacted to what they expected Maradona to do. Because 
they expected Maradona to move either left or right, he was able to go straight on.  
Monetary  policy  works  in  a  similar  way.  Market  interest  rates  react  to  what  the  central  bank  is 
expected  to  do.  In  recent  years  the  Bank  of  England  and  other  central  banks  have  experienced 
periods  in  which  they  have  been  able  to  influence  the  path  of  the  economy  without  making  large 
moves in official interest rates. They headed in a straight line for their goals. How was that possible? 
Because financial markets did not expect interest rates to remain constant. They expected that rates 
would  move  either  up  or  down.  Those  expectations  were  sufficient  –  at  times  –  to  stabilise  private 
spending while official interest rates in fact moved very little. An example of the Maradona theory of 
interest rates in action is shown in Chart 1. It is a “porcupine” chart which shows the Bank’s official 
interest rate (the repo rate) as the thick black line together with forward interest rate curves at the time 
of successive Inflation Reports in 2002. Although by no means a perfect measure, the forward interest 
rate curve provides an idea of market participants’ expectations of future policy rates. During 2002 the 
Bank  of  England  was  able  to  achieve  its  goal  by  moving  on  a  straight  line  with  unchanged  official 
interest rates. But, although interest rates scarcely moved, expectations of future interest rates – as 
embodied  in  the  forward  curve  –  did  move  around  as  the  economic  outlook  changed  from  an 
expectation of a swift recovery to worries about a protracted slowdown. And in turn those changes in 
expected  future  rates  affected  activity  and  inflation.  In  other  words,  monetary  policy  was  able  to 
respond by less than would otherwise have been necessary because it affected expectations.  
                                                      
8   An excellent example is the recent book by Michael Woodford (2003) which builds on the ideas of the Swedish economist 
Knut  Wicksell  one  hundred  years  ago  that  the  key  to  price  stability  lies  in  thinking  about  the  appropriate  path  for  future 
nominal interest rates.

That  pattern  is  sometimes  described  as  “the  market  doing  the  work  for  us”.  I  prefer  a  different 
description.  It  is  the  framework  of  monetary  policy  doing  the  work  for  us.  Because  inflation 
expectations matter to the behaviour of households and firms, the critical aspect of monetary policy is 
how the decisions of the central bank influence those expectations. As Michael Woodford has put it, 
“not  only  do  expectations  about  policy  matter,  but,  at  least  under  current  conditions,  very  little  else 
matters”.  Indeed,  one  can  argue  that  the  real  influence  of  monetary  policy  is  less  the  effect  of  any 
individual  monthly  decision  on  interest  rates  and  more  the  ability  of  the  framework  of  policy  to 
condition inflation expectations. The precise “rule” which central banks follow is less important than 
their ability to condition expectations. That is a fundamental point on which my later argument will rest.  
It should be clear that, just as Maradona could not hope to score in every game by running towards 
goal in a straight line, so monetary policy cannot hope to meet the inflation target by leaving official 
interest rates unchanged indefinitely. Rates must always be set in a way that is consistent with the 
overall strategy of keeping inflation on track to meet the target; sometimes that will imply changes in 
rates, at other times not.  
Learning and its implication for monetary policy 
The academic literature on monetary policy rules has performed a great service in emphasising the 
importance of expectations. But there are two basic problems with the use of rules. The first is that the 
validity of any given rule depends upon the model of the economy that underlies it being true. The 
second  is  that  the  calculation  of  the  rule  –  or  policy  reaction  function  –  is  extraordinarily  complex. 
Moreover,  these  two  problems  interact,  in  that  the  complexity  of  the  decision  rule  is  increased 
enormously  when  the  possibility  of  learning  about  the  true  model  is  introduced.  So  although  policy 
rules offer important insights they do not provide a practical guide to decision-making, and it is useful 
to examine more deeply why that is the case. 
No  economist  can  point  to  a  particular  model,  and  in  honesty  say  “that  is  how  the  world  works”.  A 
crucial difference between economic and, say, meteorological analysis is that in economics there are 
no  natural  constants,  not  even  for  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment.  Our  understanding  of  the 
economy  is  incomplete  and  constantly evolving,  sometimes  in small  steps,  sometimes  in big  leaps. 
The stock of knowledge is not static. So any monetary policy rule that is judged to be optimal today is 
likely  to  be  superseded  by  a  new  and  improved  version  tomorrow.  In  other  words,  there  is  no 
time-invariant  policy  reaction  function  which  could  describe  the  policy  intentions  of  a  central  bank. 
Rather, monetary policy in practice is characterised by a continuous process of learning embedded, in 
the case of the Bank of England, in the rounds of meetings and forecasts that are the daily life of the 
Monetary Policy Committee.  
To  convince  you  of  how  important  learning  about  key  economic  relationships  is  to  decisions  on 
monetary  policy,  let  me  show  you  two  charts  which  illustrate  some  of  the  challenges  facing  the 
Monetary  Policy  Committee.  A  basic  proposition  common  to  most  models  of  the  economy  is  that  if 
demand exceeds the supply capacity of the economy then there will be upward pressure on wage and 
price inflation. In the labour market supply capacity is often equated, in the long run, with a particular 
rate of unemployment. Chart 2 plots the unemployment rate against the inflation rate in the UK over 
the period 1993-2004. It shows the trade off between unemployment and inflation in the short run, also 
known as the Phillips curve. Unemployment fell from nearly 10% in 1993 to less than 3% in 2004. But 
– in stark contrast to the earlier post-war period – inflation remained virtually unchanged. How can we 
explain this phenomenon? Was it because the natural rate of unemployment also fell – perhaps as a 
result of labour market reforms enacted in the 1980s and 1990s? Or did the Phillips curve become 
flatter  –  perhaps  because  inflation  expectations  were  anchored  on  the  target  so  that  deviations  of 
unemployment from the natural rate generated less pressure on wages and inflation than before? Or 
was the outcome the result of a chance sequence of shocks that held inflation down?  
Chart 3 shows that the slope of the short-run Phillips curve has moved around during the post-war 
period, apparently in response to changes in the monetary policy regime. In the 1970s labour market 
pressure was not offset by tighter monetary policy, leading to a spiral of wage and price inflation. The 
short-run  Phillips  curve  steepened,  with  larger  inflationary  consequences  of  any  deviation  from  the 
natural rate of unemployment. As monetary policy became more focused on controlling inflation, the 
Phillips curve flattened in the latter part of the 1980s and 1990s. Such changes in the monetary policy 
regime can also be detected in the behaviour of inflation over time. Table 2 shows that the persistence 
of  inflation  –  measured  by  the  estimated  explanatory  power  of  past  inflation  in  predicting  current 
inflation  –  has  fallen  quite  markedly  since  the  inflation  target  was  introduced  in  1992.  Was  this 
4 
 BIS Review 36/2005
because the failure of monetary policy to react quickly to an inflationary shock in the 1970s meant that 
inflation remained high for some time? And has the prompt response of monetary policy meant that 
movements in inflation more recently have proved short-lived?  
The answers to these questions matter for monetary policy. But the economy is continually evolving, 
and  we  can  never  definitively  conclude  that  one  answer  is  right  and  the  others  wrong.  So  learning 
about changes in the structure of the economy lies at the heart of the daily work of central banks. To 
describe monetary policy in terms of a constant rule derived from a known model of the economy is to 
ignore this process of learning. So how should central banks behave in the light of their ignorance? 
Two approaches have been suggested. 
Interestingly, at one end of the spectrum, both Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas argued that policy 
should be based on a simple rule precisely because of our ignorance. Central banks, in their view, 
should have limited ambitions and aim simply at steady growth of the money supply – the so-called k% 
rule  under  which  the  money  stock  rises  at  a  fixed  rate,  k%,  each  year.  As  Friedman  (1968)  put  it, 
“Steady monetary growth would provide a monetary climate favourable to the operation of those basic 
forces …… that are the true springs of economic growth. That is the most that we can ask of monetary 
policy at our present state of knowledge”.9 The principle of adopting a strategy that takes into account 
limits to our knowledge is a sound one. But advocates of a rigid k% rule argue that we should ignore 
all other sources of information (estimates of the output gap, for example) and allow any shocks to the 
velocity of money to feed through to activity or the price level. In practice, experience in both Europe 
and the US has shown that velocity shocks can be large and few economists now advocate the use of 
k% rules. So committing to a wholly inflexible rule is likely to be neither desirable nor credible. Our 
knowledge is neither complete nor constant. 
At  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  rational  optimising  behaviour  can,  in  principle,  generate  a  policy 
reaction function which takes into account uncertainty about the economy and the process of learning 
about  economic  relationships.  Such  a  reaction  function  would  describe  how  a  central  bank  would 
respond to any conceivable shock in the future, and explain how estimates of parameter values and 
the weights attached to particular models would be updated. But even in very simple examples the 
cleverest economists find the solution of those decision problems almost impossibly complicated. Fully 
rational  optimising  behaviour  is  unreasonably  demanding.  In  the  words  of  Gerd  Gigerenzer  (2001), 
optimisation  is  for “Laplacean demons”  not human beings –  a  reference  to an  imaginary being  that 
“…could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that 
of the lightest atom…”10
Both approaches, for very different reasons, end up with a monetary policy rule. The simple rule is not 
credible because we do know some things and we can learn from the past. The complicated rule is not 
feasible because it places unrealistic demands on our ability to process information. Given the lack of 
further guidance from economists as to how to make decisions, central banks have often retreated to 
the  position  that  setting  interest  rates  requires  the  exercise  of  unfettered  discretion.  But  this  has 
problems  of  its  own.  As  has  long  been  recognised,  pure  discretion  does  not  keep  private  sector 
expectations of inflation in line with the desired rate of inflation. If we are to find our way through the 
minefield between rules, on the one hand, and pure discretion, on the other, we need to think more 
carefully about the nature of decision-making in a complex world where the central bank and economic 
agents alike are learning about their environment.  
Human beings, including central bankers, are not “Laplacean demons”. Given the constraints on their 
scarce time, observation suggests that people follow simple rules of thumb.11 These rules of thumb are 
sometimes described as “heuristics”. The easiest way to understand a heuristic is to imagine a cricket 
match. The fielder is standing in the deep when the batsman hits the ball somewhere in his direction – 
see Chart 4. How should the fielder try to catch the ball? One view – the rational optimisation view – is 
that the fielder either knows, or behaves as if he knows, the laws of physics. Then he could compute 
the trajectory of the ball, run to the point at which he could catch it (A in Chart 4), and wait for the ball 
to arrive. This theory of decision-making has testable implications. The fielder will run in a straight line 
(the solid line FA), and will normally be stationary when making the catch. But that is not how fielders

behave  in  practice.  Various  empirical  studies  of  baseball  and  cricket  players  suggest  that  fielders 
follow simple heuristics. For example, they keep their eye on the ball, adjusting their running speed so 
that the angle of the gaze – the angle between the eye and the ball – remains roughly constant.12 The 
heuristic will guide the fielder to the point at which he can catch the ball, without a need to acquire 
information about variables such as wind speed and direction, spin or the other relevant factors, nor 
perform complex calculations on those data. But it means that the fielder will run in a slight arc (the 
dotted  line  FA)  and  be  moving  when  the  ball  arrives.  What  is  instructive  about  this  example  is  the 
ability to distinguish empirically between a simple heuristic and fully optimising behaviour, and that the 
evidence favours the former.  
A  useful  heuristic  has  two  characteristics.  It  should  be  fast  to  compute  and  frugal  in  its  data 
requirements. New heuristics can be adopted when needed. We might think of a “toolbox” of heuristics 
from  which  an  appropriate  choice  can  be  made  according  to  the  task  that  is  to  be  performed. 
Experimental evidence in laboratory settings shows that some fast and frugal heuristics can be about 
as accurate as much more data-intensive, optimisation-based methods such as multiple regression.  
What are the implications of heuristics for monetary policy? There are two issues. First, although the 
central bank will try to be as rational as possible in processing all the relevant information, it may well 
itself use a range of heuristics. For example, in normal circumstances the heuristic “set interest rates 
such that expected inflation two years ahead is equal to the target” might serve the Monetary Policy 
committee well. But in other circumstances, say following a large shock, the heuristic might be “bring 
inflation back to target over a period of more than two years and explain carefully why the heuristic has 
changed”. The central bank can adapt its particular policy-setting heuristic to changing circumstances 
and evolving knowledge, so that the policy regime as a whole is robust to changing views about how 
the economy works.  
Second, we do not know whether – and, if so, to what extent – people use heuristics to make real 
economic decisions. But a central bank should be alert to the possibility of their doing so. Given the 
importance of expectations, the more the central bank can do to behave in a way that makes it easy 
for the private sector to adopt a simple heuristic to guide expectations the better. A good heuristic from 
that point of view would be "expect inflation to be equal to target". A bad heuristic would be "if inflation 
is  well  away  from  target  expect  it  to  deviate  further".  We  can  encourage  people  to  use  the  first  by 
announcing targets that are quantitative and useful. We can discourage the second by being open and 
transparent about the reasons for movements in inflation and decisions on monetary policy. If we have 
no hidden message, then eventually people will stop looking for it. 
Rational optimising behaviour is in many situations too demanding, and actual decisions may reflect 
the use of heuristics. That must be taken on board in the choice of monetary policy strategy. In turn 
the strategy may affect the heuristic chosen by economic agents. And a good strategy will not only 
help agents choose a heuristic but will be robust with respect to that choice. Does inflation targeting 
meet those criteria?  
Inflation targeting as a framework which accommodates learning  
So  far  I  have  emphasised  three  key  points  about  monetary  policy.  First,  expectations  play  a 
fundamental role in the way monetary policy works. As the Maradona theory of interest rates shows, 
expectations of future monetary policy actions are at least as important as the level at which the official 
interest rate is set today. Second, our knowledge of the economy is continuously evolving – as the 
history  of  the  Mais  lecture  has  itself  demonstrated.  There  simply  is  no  unchanging  rule,  however 
complex, that can adequately describe the optimal monetary policy strategy. Third, the complexity of 
optimising behaviour means that central banks need to allow for the possibility that people use simple 
rules of thumb.  
Taken together, these arguments provide a powerful case for inflation targeting. An inflation targeting 
framework combines two distinct elements: (a) a precise numerical target for inflation in the medium-
term and (b) a response to economic shocks in the short term. The inflation target provides a rule-like 
framework on which the private sector can anchor its expectations about future inflation. As Gordon 
Brown put it in his Mais Lecture in 1999, "a credible framework means working within clearly defined 
                                                      
12   To be precise, the angle of gaze remains within a certain range - reported by Gigerenzer and Selten (2001).

long-term  policy  objectives,  maximum  openness  and  transparency,  and  clear  and  accountable 
divisions of responsibility". It is a natural heuristic around which agents can form their expectations. 
And the discretion in responding to shocks afforded by inflation targeting allows the central bank to 
adapt  its  strategy  to  new  information.  That  is  why  inflation  targeting  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  a 
framework of “constrained discretion”. Following a shock which moves inflation away from target and 
output from its normal level, there is discretion about the horizon over which inflation is brought back to 
target. But the exercise of that discretion must be clearly explained and justified in terms of the need, 
in the words of the remit of the Monetary Policy Committee, to avoid “undesirable volatility in output”. 
The great attraction of an inflation target is that it is a framework that does not have to be changed 
each time we learn about aspects of the economy such as the velocity of money or the underlying rate 
of  productivity  growth,  as  was  the  case  in  the  past  with  frameworks  based  on  targets  for  money 
aggregates or nominal GDP growth. It is a framework designed for a world of learning.  
The empirical evidence suggests that inflation targeting has helped to confer tangible benefits. One 
test  of  whether  inflation  expectations  are  well-anchored  is  the  volatility  of  long-term  interest  rates. 
Chart 5 shows the standard deviation of ten-year forward interest rates in the United Kingdom since 
1992 and compares it with the figure for the United States. In both countries, volatility rose in the early 
1990s. But whereas volatility has been broadly stable in the United States since the mid-1990s, it has 
fallen steadily in the United Kingdom. In a comparative study of OECD countries, Levin et al (2004) 
found that inflation expectations were better anchored in inflation targeting countries in the sense that 
movements in actual inflation were less likely to cause inflation expectations to change. The clarity and 
simplicity of an inflation target mean that a natural heuristic for the private sector is “expected inflation 
equals the inflation target”. 
Inflation targeting is a framework for making and communicating decisions. It is not a new theory of the 
transmission mechanism of  monetary  policy.  It  does  not reflect  a  new  understanding  of  the  laws of 
economics.  But,  by  anchoring  inflation  expectations  on  the  target,  it  can  alter  the  transmission 
mechanism by reducing the persistence of inflationary shocks. And it does so without pretending to 
commit to a rule that is incredible because it is not expected to last. 
The implications of an inflation target for central bank communications are natural enough. First, the 
clarity  of  the  inflation  target  focuses  attention  on  the  case  for  price  stability  which  must  be  made 
continuously. Second, each forecast must be accompanied by an explanation of the current thinking 
behind  the  MPC’s  views;  in  essence  the  “model”  underlying  the  MPC’s  thinking  is  changing  all  the 
time. Third, there is no point trying to communicate a time-invariant policy reaction function when that 
does not exist. The regular commentary on its thinking published in its Minutes and Inflation Reports is 
part  of  a  process  by  which  the  MPC  communicates  with  the  general  public.  A  reputation  for 
communicating openly and honestly about the range of possible outcomes matters, because it makes 
it more likely that people will continue to listen. 
What are the main challenges for inflation targeting in the future? The most immediate stems from its 
very success. Although it is now widely accepted that there is no long-run trade off between inflation 
and  output,  the  ability  of  monetary  policy  to  affect  output  in  the  short  run  means  that  there  is,  in 
principle, a permanent trade off between the volatility of inflation and the volatility of output, which 
might be represented by the line AA in chart 6. The choice of a horizon over which to bring inflation 
back  to  target  is  equivalent  to  choosing  a  point  on  this  volatility  trade  off.  The  striking  change, 
however,  is  the  remarkable  improvement  in  the  trade-off  that  followed  the  introduction  of  inflation 
targeting, as can be seen in chart 6. The volatility of both inflation and output growth were much lower 
than in earlier periods.  
Part  of  the  improvement may  lie  in  the  pattern  of shocks  over the  past  decade,  although  the world 
economy has hardly contributed to that stability. So the challenge ahead is that if a shock, larger than 
we  have  experienced  recently  but  not  large  relative  to  historical  experience,  were  to  move  inflation 
significantly away from target, then inflation expectations might become dislodged from the target. The 
behaviour of expectations and so the economy as a whole would change. So far there is little sign that 
the shocks we have experienced have detached inflation expectations from the target, and that is a 
source of comfort. But the MPC will continue to pay particular attention to the evidence on inflation 
expectations.  Many  of  the  problems  of  the  past  resulted  from  the  failure  to  take  action  before 
expectations had started to drift upwards, and the cost of that inaction proved to be high. When the 
time comes for me to write an open letter to the Chancellor because inflation has deviated by more 
than  one  percentage  point  from  target  –  and  it  is  very  surprising  that  such  a  letter  has  not  been 
required in the eight years since the MPC was set up – I will welcome the opportunity to explain how

we expect to bring inflation back to target and over what horizon. Such letters are an integral part of 
the policy framework, not an indication of its failure. 
Conclusions 
In this lecture I have advanced three propositions. First, expectations are of fundamental importance 
to monetary policy. Second, the strategy of policy is more important than any of the individual monthly 
decisions on interest rates. Third, in designing a strategy be aware of the likely role of heuristics in 
forming expectations, and so keep it simple.  
From  those  perspectives  inflation  targeting  appears  a  natural  way  to  conduct  monetary  policy.  And 
experience of inflation targeting suggests that a managed monetary standard can lead to stability – of 
both inflation and the economy as a whole – without the straitjacket of a gold standard, currency board 
or  rigid  fixed  exchange  rate  target.  Inflation  targeting  anchors  inflation  expectations,  yet  allows  a 
flexible response to economic shocks. 
Is  inflation  targeting  the  last  word  in  monetary  policy?  Almost  certainly  not.  Twenty-five  years  from 
now, I am confident that one of my successors will be able to look back and explain in his or her Mais 
Lecture the great improvements that took place between 2005 and 2030. But I like to think that the 
inflation target framework has the ability to serve us well over that period. 
Thirty  years  ago  the  theory  of  monetary  policy  was  ahead  of  its  practice,  at  least  in  the  United 
Kingdom. Now I hope that the practice has given the theorists something to think about.
