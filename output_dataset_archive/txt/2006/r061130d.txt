Lars Nyberg: Are hedge funds dangerous?  
Speech by Mr Lars Nyberg, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at a meeting at Nordea and 
the CFA Society of Sweden, Stockholm, 24 November 2006. 
 I shall begin by thanking you for the invitation to come here to Nordea and the CFA Society of Sweden 
to develop some thoughts on the usefulness and risks with hedge funds. After several years of strong 
growth,  hedge  funds  are  a  hot  topic  among  market  agents  and  authorities.  Although  hedge  funds’ 
percentage of the total capital managed is small, around five per cent, they account for a large part of 
the liquidity on certain markets. Many people express concern as to what effects hedge funds might 
have on financial stability and after the much-publicised collapse of the US hedge fund Amaranth in 
the autumn, the debate on regulation has gained new impetus. 
As  you  may  perhaps  know,  Amaranth  primarily  traded  various  gas  and  energy  derivatives.  After 
summer 2005, Amaranth held gigantic positions in the gas market – they believed in a price increase. 
Between August and October 2005 the price of natural gas rose by 50 per cent, partly as a result of 
the severe hurricanes. The fund earned substantial amounts of money and the fund managers were 
also  expecting  this  autumn  to  see  high  energy  prices  during  the  winter.  They  bought  futures  for 
November and March and sold (sold short) contracts for October and April. However, this year did not 
develop as expected. During the period from August to mid-September the price of natural gas fell by 
40 per cent and in a couple of weeks Amaranth lost USD 6 billion, which corresponded to two thirds of 
its capital. Despite the size of the amount, the market effects were largely non-existent and there was 
never any concern in terms of financial stability. The private sector also managed to settle its positions 
without any intervention from the responsible authorities. Does this mean that the concern over hedge 
funds  is  exaggerated?  Or  is  increased  regulation  necessary?  Before  I  discuss  these  questions, 
however, I would like to take a brief look back at the development of hedge funds in recent years.1  
A look back 
Hedge funds are a relatively new phenomenon in the Swedish market. However, the first hedge fund 
was  established  in  the  United  States  60  years  ago.  At  the  end  of  the  1940s,  US  journalist  Alfred 
Winslow Jones bought shares he considered to be under-valued and sold short shares he considered 
over-valued. His idea was that the price of under-valued shares should rise relatively more on a rising 
market and the price of over-valued shares should fall relatively more on a falling market. If the fund 
managers  made  a  reasonable  selection,  this  meant  that  the  fund  would  earn  money  regardless  of 
whether the market rose or fell – in other words the fund was protected, or hedged, against systematic 
market risk.  
In other words, the initial idea of hedge funds was to take positions based on the price relationships 
between securities, while limiting or eliminating market risk. Many people still connect the concept of a 
hedge  fund  with  this  strategy,  but  today  this  so-called  market-neutral  strategy  is  only  one  of  many. 
Moreover, the concept hedge fund is misleading, as many of the funds do not hedge, but take large 
net positions.  
A  common  factor  for  hedge  funds  is  that  they  have  absolute  earnings  targets  -  rather  than  relating 
earnings  to  a  benchmark  index.  They  are  also  subject  to  much  fewer  restrictions  concerning 
investment strategies than traditional funds. In addition to buying securities, the hedge funds can go 
short,  that  is  to  say,  they  can  sell  securities  they  do  not  own.  Moreover,  they  can  use  pledges  or 
derivatives to increase or decrease the risk in their fund management. Investments in hedge funds are 
often tied over a long period of time, which means that the fund can take on fairly illiquid positions. The 
charges are performance-based, which gives the fund managers a clear incentive to strive for good 
earnings. It is also common that fund managers themselves invest substantial amounts in their own 
hedge fund.

However, hedge funds are far from a homogeneous group. One may roughly distinguish three overall 
investment strategies: market-neutral, directional and event-driven. Market-neutral strategies attempt, 
as  I  mentioned  earlier,  to  exploit  differences  in  the  valuation  of  various  securities,  while  trying  to 
protect  themselves  against  overall  market  risk.  Directional  strategies  entail  finding  macroeconomic 
trends and trying to predict future market movements. Event-driven strategies aim to identify securities 
whose  prices  will  be  affected  by  specific  corporate  events,  such  as  acquisitions,  mergers  and 
bankruptcies. Neither of the latter two investment strategies is thus hedged in Jones’ original sense. 
Many  hedge funds  describe  themselves  as  "multi-strategy”  –  they  combine  different strategies  over 
time to achieve the highest possible earnings. This also applied to Amaranth, but the fact was that half 
of the fund’s assets were invested in forward contracts for natural gas. Many hedge funds also use 
complex trade strategies, where they try to find discrepancies between different derivative prices or 
maturities and their theoretical values. The well-known hedge fund Long Term Capital Management 
(LTCM), which crashed in 1998, was this type of fund. 
Developments internationally and in Sweden 
Over  the  past  ten  years,  hedge  funds  have  grown  considerably,  both  in  terms  of  number  and  the 
amount of capital managed. Internationally, the capital managed has grown by almost 30 per cent a 
year since 1998. Today the hedge funds manage approximately USD 1,000 billion, corresponding to 
around  5  per  cent  of  the  total  capital  managed  internationally,  divided  between  8,000  funds.  Most 
hedge funds are relatively small, most have fewer than SEK 800 million in managed capital and almost 
half  of  them  have  less  than  SEK  200  million.  However,  there  are  exceptions.  LTCM  –  which  was 
gigantic – had at most a capital of around SEK 70 billion. This can be compared, for instance, with the 
state pension funds in Sweden, which each manage capital amounting to around SEK 150 million.  
The  hedge  fund  market  has  also  developed  rapidly  in  Sweden.  Brummer  &  Partners  were  first  in 
Sweden, with their hedge fund Zenit, in summer 1996.Nektar, which operates in the fixed income and 
foreign exchange market, and originally followed Jones’ ideas completely, came soon after. Since then 
around  60  more  funds  have  been  established  and  the  capital  managed  has  gradually  increased. 
Today, hedge funds account for a good six per cent of the total capital managed in Swedish-registered 
funds. This percentage has more than doubled over the past ten years and now corresponds to just 
over SEK 85 billion.2 The size of the Swedish hedge funds varies substantially. The largest Swedish 
hedge  fund  had  at  the  end  of  June  2005  a  market  value  of  a  good  SEK  26  billion,  which  is  a 
considerable  sum  even  in  an  international  perspective.  The  smallest  fund  at  the  same  time  had  a 
negative  market  value  of  SEK  5  million.  The  median  fund  had  a  market  value  of  around  SEK  225 
million. [Figure 1] 
The hedge funds’ earnings over the past ten years may not appear that fantastic at first glance. One of 
the largest hedge fund indices, Credit Suisse/Tremont has over the past twelve years had an average 
increase in value of around 8 per cent, similar to the S&P 500. However, if one takes into account the 
low risk in most hedge funds, the picture is entirely different. For instance, the Swedish hedge fund 
index shows a much lower volatility than the general index. [Figure 2 and 3]

Initially,  the  investors  consisted  almost  exclusively  of  wealthy  individuals.  Gradually,  institutional 
investors such as pension funds, foundations and insurance companies have also begun to invest in 
hedge funds. Some time back the market also opened up to small-scale savers, as a number of hedge 
funds now have lower minimum requirements for the capital invested. In addition, a large part of the 
capital inflow today is through funds that invest in other hedge funds, known as Funds of Hedge Funds 
(FOHFs), which also allow relatively low investment amounts. These funds also entail an advantage in 
that the investor does not need to have specific knowledge of each individual fund. On the other hand, 
the investment is more expensive as these funds generally take out an additional fee on top of the 
hedge funds’ own fees. 
What,  then  has  driven  and  is  driving  the  explosive  development  in  hedge  funds?  One  important 
explanation is, of course, that the hedge funds, as I recently described, have become more accessible 
to a wider circle of investors. Hedge funds have a number of positive characteristics, one of the most 
important being that they help the investors to diversify their portfolios. By supplementing an existing 
investment portfolio with a hedge fund, the investor can both reduce risk and increase earnings, which 
may appear as a contradiction. However, the reason is the hedge funds’ low correlation to traditional 
asset types such as shares and debt securities. With the aid of hedge funds, the investor can both 
protect his/her portfolio during downswings and dampen the effects of a fluctuating market. The heavy 
stock  market  decline  immediately  after  the  turn  of  the  millennium  gave  hedge  funds  an  additional 
boost,  as  many  people  were  looking  for  alternative  forms  of  investment.  In  recent  years,  long-term 
interest  rates  have  gradually  fallen  to  historically  low  levels,  which  has  led  to  a  search  for  yield, 
investors seeking new asset types, which initially also benefited the hedge funds. 
Hedge funds and the financial markets 
Hedge  funds  fulfil  several  valuable  functions  in  the  financial  markets;  they  provide  liquidity,  they 
improve pricing and they increase transparency. The fact that hedge funds contribute to better liquidity 
is particularly noticeable in new and more complex markets, such as the market for credit derivatives, 
where the hedge funds currently account for an estimated 25 per cent of the activity among primary 
dealers.  The  hedge  funds  that  have  specialised  in  identifying  mispriced  assets  –  that  is,  classic 
arbitrage  –  often  contribute  to  more  correct  market  pricing,  which  in  turn  leads  to  a  more  efficient

Hedge funds are speculative and prone to herd behaviour. 
allocation of resources and better risk management. This is an important contribution to the efficiency 
of the financial markets.  
However, as I observed at the beginning of my speech, the rapid growth in hedge funds has created 
an international debate on the risks entailed in their operations and potential negative effects on the 
financial  system.  There  is  concern  both  for  the  role  of  the  hedge  funds  as  counterparties  to  other 
agents and for the hedge funds’ own activities. With regard to counterparty risks, these mainly concern 
the banks’ exposures to hedge funds and indirect risks through contagion effects in the markets. Large 
and complex positions in certain markets may make the contagion risks difficult to distinguish. 
With regard to the hedge funds’ own activities, the concerns are based on three beliefs: 
• 
• 
• 
Let me comment on these points one by one. It is true that in most countries hedge funds’ activities 
are less than transparent (although not in Sweden). The authorities in many countries have little or no 
information about the funds’ activities or the persons active in them. This applies in particular to funds 
that are located off-shore, such as in Bermuda or the Cayman Islands. This creates not only a risk that 
risk  concentrations  build  up,  but  also  facilitate  illegal  activities.  The  number  of  cases  where  hedge 
funds are suspected of being involved in various forms of fraud has grown dramatically in the United 
States in recent years. My opinion on this point is clear: Hedge funds should of course be subjected to 
the same disclosure requirements as other financial institutions.  
The  second  source  of  concern  concerns  indebtedness.  Unlike  more  regulated  institutions,  hedge 
funds can in principle have unlimited leverage. This may be worrying from a stability perspective. A 
high level of indebtedness naturally increases both the probability of and the effects of a failure. The 
debt/equity ratio varies, but the fact is that most hedge funds are not heavily leveraged. To get a rough 
idea  of  the  indebtedness  of  a  fund  one  may  simply  divide  the  fund’s  market  value  by  its  equity. 
Calculations  show  that  for  the  most  indebted  Swedish  hedge  fund  this  measure  is  320  per  cent, 
compared with a median of 80 per cent. An international study from 2003 shows that the debt/equity 
ratio was less than 200 per cent in more than 80 per cent of the funds examined. These are modest 
levels  in  comparison  with  financial  institutions.  For  example,  the  major  Swedish  banks  have  a 
debt/equity ratio of 2,300 per cent on average. 
Thirdly,  hedge  funds  are  often  accused  of  engaging  in  herd  behaviour,  that  is,  of  imitating  one 
another's  behaviour  and  taking  similar  positions.  This  type  of  strategy  risks  reinforcing  market 
fluctuations  and  having  a  destabilising  effect.  This  applies  in  particular  to  macro  funds,  which  take 
positions and investment decisions on the basis of an expectation of macroeconomic developments. 
For example, it is often claimed that hedge funds were involved in and reinforced the effects of the 
ERM crises. The evidence is not clear-cut. I believe that it is difficult to claim that hedge funds follow 
the prevailing trend to a greater extent than other investors. Traditional investors often have limits that 
force them to sell when there is a sharp fall in the price of an asset. This could in turn lead to a self-
reinforcing  spiral.  The  absolute,  rather  than  relative,  required  rate  of  return  on  hedge  funds  should 
reduce the incentives for herd behaviour. On the other hand, it is true that the hedge funds are very 
quick to take advantage of mispricing and imbalances in companies’ finances or countries’ economies, 
such as an unsustainable exchange rate – but this is of course difficult to be critical of. 
When we discuss the effects of hedge funds on the financial markets, I believe it may be useful to 
compare  the  crisis  at  Amaranth,  which  I  described  in  the  beginning,  with  the  crisis  at  LTCM.  The 
effects on the financial markets were very different. Despite the fact that Amaranth’s losses were much 
greater  than  those  of  LTCM,  no  authority  needed  to  intervene;  Amaranth  was  able  to  close  its 
positions of its own accord and in a smooth manner. The large positions were sold (at a substantial 
discount, one assumes) to JP Morgan and Citadel, another large hedge fund. The situation with LTCM 
was quite different. A number of events during 1998 (including the Russian debt crisis) had created 
considerable unease in the financial markets and LTCM had entirely the wrong positions for such a 
development. When the investors’ assets had fallen from USD 5 billion to USD 1.5 billion in the space 
of six months, the US central bank intervened. The size of the fund, combined with the fact that so 
many financial agents were involved, meant that the Federal Reserve saw a threat to financial stability. 
To avoid an uncontrolled collapse, the Fed called together a group of LTCM’s largest creditors, who 
took over the fund’s positions. 
BIS Review 116/2006

One important difference between the two hedge funds was how much they had borrowed in relation 
to their capital. The debt/equity ratio at LTCM was between 25 and 30, while that at Amaranth was 
around 5. A further problem for LTCM was that the fund was partly involved in very complex positions 
on the derivatives market that were difficult to close. Many other funds and banks held the same types 
of positions. Amaranth, on the other hand, was largely alone in its part of the market – most others had 
no positions, or contrary positions, in energy derivatives. This made settlement easier, if not cheaper. 
A further explanation is probably that Amaranth’s losses occurred under very favourable economic and 
financial  circumstances,  where  the  market  had  good  access  to  capital.  This  was  far  from  the  case 
when  LTCM  tried  to  settle  its  positions  in  the  midst  of  the  Russia  crisis.  Under  more  strained 
conditions, perhaps the sequence of events for Amaranth would have been entirely different and the 
risks to the financial system much greater.  
However, the fact that the financial system could manage the problems in Amaranth may also imply 
that it has become more resilient. The markets have demonstrated that they can manage a number of 
major strains in recent years, both macroeconomic shocks and unexpected market events, without any 
tangible effect on their functioning. The banks’ management of risk and their collateral requirements 
do appear to be stricter than they were in 1998. We will return to a further discussion of the resilience 
of the financial system when the Riksbank’s Financial Stability Report is published at the beginning of 
December. 
Does the hedge fund market require further regulation? 
As the hedge funds have grown, voices have been raised calling for more extensive regulation of the 
funds’ operations. Ordinary investment funds are regulated by the UCITS directive. UCITS regulates, 
for instance, the type of assets a fund is allowed to invest in, the information that should be given to 
investors, and the diversification of risks.3 Hedge funds, on the other hand, are completely unregulated 
in  many  countries.  In  return,  the  authorities  often  require  that  investments  in  hedge  funds  should 
exceed a certain minimum level.4 The purpose of this requirement is to limit the hedge funds' investor 
circle  to  wealthy  and,  presumably,  well-informed  individuals  and  thereby  to  protect  "ordinary" 
consumers. Most hedge funds are constructed so that the investor, under unfortunate circumstances, 
may lose all or at least large parts of his capital.  
In  the  United  States  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  has  long  attempted  to  increase 
transparency  in  hedge  funds.  In  February  this  year  they  introduced  a  new  regulation  that  entails  a 
registration  requirement  for  most  large  hedge  funds  –  even  those  invested off-shore. However,  this 
regulation was declared invalid by a Federal court in June.  
In  Sweden,  hedge  funds  are  obliged  to  register  with  Finansinspektionen,  the  Swedish  Financial 
Supervisory Authority, and to regularly report any measures that describe the risks in the fund, such as 
value-at-risk measures or measures of liquidity risk and indebtedness. The main rule is that the fund’s 
resources, as in the case of securities funds, should be invested according to the principle regarding 
risk diversification. Given this, it has not been considered necessary to set a minimum requirement for 
investment.  Previously,  Swedish  hedge  funds  were  obliged  to  report  all  of  their  holdings  to 
Finansinspektionen, but this was not considered particularly meaningful. 
There are two main arguments for regulating hedge funds’ operations. The first is based on protecting 
the  consumers  from  funds  that  take  excessive  risks.  Amaranth’s  gigantic  losses  affected  several 
pension funds, for instance. However, in my opinion, this type of argument is rather strange. If one 
wants  to  protect  pension  savers’  investments,  one  should  limit  the  pension  funds’  investment 
opportunities, not the hedge funds’ operations. 
The second argument is linked to financial stability and the increasing role played by hedge funds. If a 
large number of funds were to fail and at the same time be highly indebted, there is a risk that the 
financial markets would be affected. However, this scarcely constitutes a reason for limiting the hedge 
funds’ investment freedom or for introducing some form of capital adequacy requirement. As I see it,

November  2005  and  “The  regulation  and  distribution  of  hedge  funds  in  Europe  –  Changes  and  challenges”,

In Italy the minimum limit for investment is EUR 500 000, in Ireland it is EUR 250 000 and in Spain it is EUR 50 000.

such regulation could result in liquidity disappearing from the markets where the hedge funds operate 
just when it is needed most. Increased disclosure of funds’ risks, on the other hand, could help the 
market  to  function  efficiently.  If  the  hedge  funds’  risk  positions  can  be  assessed  externally,  market 
discipline ought to improve. 
I consider that both LTCM and Amaranth are good examples that transparency rather than regulation 
is the problem. As I have already mentioned, LTCM was a very large fund and at the same time had 
heavy loans. The fact that the banks concerned accepted such a high level of indebtedness is in itself 
remarkable – one explanation was probably confidence in the prominent figures behind LTCM, who 
included  Robert  Merton  and  Myron  Scholes.  However,  the  banks  did  not  have  any  overview  of  the 
fund’s size and total risk position. In their own interest, they should have required greater disclosure, 
and the authorities should have required this of the banks. 
With  regard  to  the  positions  in  Amaranth,  there  are  similar  questions.  Why  didn’t  the  markets  and 
clearing institutions react to the large build-up of risk? And why didn’t the lenders adjust their margin 
calls  to  correspond  to  the  risk  concentration?  Better  disclosure  of  Amaranth’s  risk  profile,  from  the 
authorities, the markets, the clearing institutions and individual lenders would probably have increased 
the chance of detecting the risk positions being built up.  
Conclusion 
New financial crises will occur and hedge funds, which have become an integral part of the modern 
financial  markets,  will  probably  be  involved.  The  large  capital  flow  to  the  sector  has  meant,  not 
unexpectedly,  that  profitability  has  declined  and  it  is  not  unreasonable  to  expect  that  a  number  of 
funds will consequently be forced to close down after more or less substantial losses. However, the 
advantages  of  the  hedge  funds’  operations  exceed  the  risks  from  a  welfare  perspective.  The 
Riksbank’s  view  as  regards  further  regulation  is  that  the  focus  should  be  on  the  hedge  funds' 
counterparties  -  particularly  the  systemically-important  banks  -  being  able  to  manage  their  risks. 
Improving the banks’ risk management with regard to hedge funds has been the objective of a number 
of initiatives by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and other organisations ever since the 
LTCM crisis in 1998. From a stability point of view, the central issue is that the systemically-important 
banks  should  manage  their  counterparty  exposures  correctly  –  take  sufficient  collateral,  have 
appropriate limits and be capable of managing potential liquidity problems. The arguments for further 
regulation of hedge funds are in this context weak.
