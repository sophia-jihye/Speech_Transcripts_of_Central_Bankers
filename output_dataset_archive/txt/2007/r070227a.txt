Stefan Ingves: Introduction on monetary policy 
Speech  by  Mr  Stefan  Ingves,  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  the  Riksdag  Committee  on 
Finance, Stockholm, 22 February 2007. 
 Thank  you  for  the  invitation  to  come  here!  I  came  here  for  the  first  time  one  year  ago,  as  newly- 
appointed Governor of the Riksbank. A year passes quickly, and now it is once again time for me to 
summarise the past year and at the same time report on how the Executive Board of the Riksbank 
views the prospects for the economy and inflation.  
Before I begin, I would like to welcome the fact that the Committee has decided to hold this hearing at 
a later date in relation to the publication of the Riksbank's report. Of course, this means I risk having to 
answer even sharper questions than usual, but it’s all in the line of duty. It is also important that these 
hearings are held under the best possible conditions. 
My most important message today is: 
• 
We have now begun to publish our own forecast for the repo rate. This means that we have 
taken a further step towards increased clarity and openness in monetary policy.  
Inflation  rose  last  year,  but  was  still  below  the  target.  One  of  the  main  reasons  is  the 
substantial  productivity  growth.  Understanding  which  mechanisms  lie  behind  the  strong 
productivity has been, and is, an important task for the Riksbank.  
The  economic  prospects  are  bright.  Economic  activity  is  strong  and  resource  utilisation  is 
increasing. Given this, we raised the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points last week.  
Our assessment is that the repo rate needs to be raised by a further 0.25 percentage points 
over the coming six months. After that we can probably pause a while before it is time for 
another increase. 
   Changes in the Riksbank’s forecasting methods 
Let me begin by saying something about a couple of new elements we have introduced in connection 
with the latest forecasting work.  
As  you  have  probably  already  noticed,  one change  is  that  we  are  now  for  the  first  time  basing  our 
forecasts for inflation and the real economy on our own assessment of what constitutes a reasonable 
future development of the repo rate. Previously, we based our forecasts on the assumption that the 
repo rate would develop in line with the expectations that could be read from the interest rates in the 
financial markets. Prior to this, our forecasts were based on the assumption that the repo rate would 
remain unchanged throughout the forecast period.  
The biggest advantage in using our own forecasts for the development of the repo rate is that it will 
then be clear what monetary policy the Riksbank considers reasonable in the future. This change is 
above all a further step towards increased clarity in monetary policy. I don’t believe it is possible to be 
clearer than this with regard to our intentions for the repo rate.  
I also believe that the monetary policy discussion gains by the Riksbank publishing its own forecast for 
the  interest  rate.  It  will  enrich  the  debate,  which  will  concern  more  the  future  development  of  the 
interest  rate  and  not  merely  its  current  level.  This  has  been  clear  over  the  past  week.  Our  current 
decision to raise the interest rate by a further 0.25 percentage points came under the shadow of a 
discussion on the level of the repo rate in the longer term. Since the long-term development of the 
repo rate is much more important to most households and companies than an individual interest rate 
adjustment, this is a positive sign. 
One thing it is important to emphasise is that we are talking about a forecast for the repo rate. This is 
the repo rate development that currently appears most likely given the information available. We are 
not making any promises. The fact that the Riksbank is presenting its own interest rate path does not 
mean that we are laying down a policy that we will commit ourselves to following. Previously, we did 
not commit ourselves to following the interest rate path based on market expectations. The reason is 
BIS Review 17/2007 
 1
that  the  conditions  are  constantly  changing.  Various  shocks  occur  that  mean  we  have  to  regularly 
reconsider what would be an appropriate monetary policy. Adhering to one and the same interest rate 
path,  despite  conditions  changing,  is  about  as  bad  as  always  driving  a  car  at  the  same  speed, 
regardless of whether the road is dry or treacherously icy.  
It is not particularly strange that the appropriate path for the repo rate should vary over time, but it is 
still worth emphasising this. It is sometimes raised as a potential problem that when a central bank 
presents its own policy rate forecast, it can be seen as a failure if the central bank does not later follow 
the  path  that  it  had  forecast.  However,  I  am  quite  convinced  that  the  Swedish  monetary  policy 
discussion  has  now  reached  such  a  stage  that  this  will  not  be  a  problem.  There  is  currently 
widespread understanding that the assessments are uncertain and that new information may change 
the conditions for the monetary policy decisions quite substantially.  
Others  have  pointed  to  a  risk  that  the  information  value  of  setting  interest  rates  in  the  market  may 
deteriorate if the central bank publishes its own interest rate forecast. The reason is said to be that 
market agents would then no longer seek other information that has significance for long-term rates. 
But I believe that this is also a rather exaggerated fear. The financial market agents know that we live 
in an uncertain world and will continue to make their own assessments of interest rate developments. I 
am therefore not particularly surprised that interest rates with a somewhat longer duration have only 
partially adjusted to the path we published last week. It is natural that from time to time some agents 
will have a different view of what would be an appropriate repo rate in the somewhat longer term than 
the Riksbank has, and this is also reflected in the setting of the interest rates. 
I  mentioned  that  we  have  made  two  changes  in  connection  with  the  latest  forecasts.  The  second 
change is that we have designed our report in a slightly different way. Our hope is that the new design 
will  make  the  report  more  readable.  The  report  has  also  changed  its  name  and  is  now  called  the 
"Monetary  Policy  Report”.  The  reason  for  this  is  that  the  report  will  now  contain  monetary  policy 
conclusions,  as  we  are  presenting  our  own  forecast  for  the  repo  rate.  There  will  be  a  clear  link 
between the forecasts and the monetary policy considerations directly in the report. The idea is that 
the report will not only show how we think the repo rate should develop in future, but also as clearly as 
possible describe why we think the repo rate path we have chosen is the most appropriate. I will return 
shortly to our reasoning with regard to an appropriate interest rate path on this occasion. However, 
before doing so, I intend to look back at the past year. This is what we usually do at the first hearing of 
the year. 
High productivity growth contributed to low inflation in 2006 
Inflation  rose  last  year,  but  was  nevertheless  below  the  2  per  cent  target.  CPI  inflation  rose  by  an 
average of 1.4 per cent. Underlying inflation, UND1X, was 1.2 per cent.  
A  comparison  with  our  forecasts shows  that  inflation  was  lower in  2006  than  we  had  anticipated  in 
2004. On the other hand we succeeded in predicting last year’s inflation in the forecasts we made in 
2005. 
One  reason  why  inflation  has  been  low  in  recent  years  is  that  prices  of  imported  goods  have 
developed  weakly.  This  is  probably  linked  to  stiff  international  price  competitive  pressure.  Another 
important  reason  is  that  productivity  has  risen  faster  than  the  Riksbank  and  other  forecasters  had 
expected.  The  unexpectedly  high  productivity  growth  has  meant  that  companies  have  been  able  to 
increase production at a rapid rate without costs per unit produced rising to any great extent.  
Understanding which mechanisms and changes in the economy that lie behind the strong productivity 
has  been,  and  is,  an  important  task  for  the  Riksbank.  Other  forecasters  have  also  assumed  that 
companies’  production  conditions  should  have  been  affected  by  the  various  structural  changes  we 
have seen acting in the economy over many years now. I am thinking here of phenomena such as 
globalisation and the rapid development of information technology. Most analysts probably agree that 
these  changes  have  contributed  to  increased  competitive  pressure  and  that  they  have  enabled 
production to be made more efficient in several ways. We have also been able to note that productivity 
growth  has  shown  an  increase  trend  over  the  past  decade.  This  has  confirmed  our  opinion  that 
structural factors in the economy lie behind the strong productivity growth.  
It is one thing to observe structural changes in the economy and have an opinion on the direction in 
which they will have an effect. It is another thing entirely to be able to predict with any accuracy how 
large and how lasting the impact will be. One of the conditions that must be taken into account is that 
2 
 BIS Review 17/2007
productivity growth usually varies over the business cycle. At the beginning of the business cycle, for 
instance, productivity growth is usually quite high. Part of the strong productivity in recent years has 
probably therefore been cyclical. But exactly how much is difficult to say.  
At  the  same  time,  the  assessment  of  productivity  growth  is  an  important  building  block  in  the 
Riksbank’s inflation forecasts. Gaining a deeper knowledge of the driving forces behind productivity 
growth  will  therefore  remain  a  high  priority  area  for  the  Riksbank.  The  Bank  already  has  a  project 
aimed at improving understanding of the correlation between, among other things, IT investments and 
productivity  growth.  We  also  intend  to  invite  various  researchers  to  an  in-depth  discussion  on  the 
driving forces behind productivity in Sweden and abroad. Hopefully, this will give us some new insights 
into productivity development.  
As  a  complement  to  our  statistical  studies  of  productivity  and  other  subjects,  we  will  also  create 
channels for direct contacts with companies. This is to improve our knowledge of the current status 
and current events in the economy. 
At the same time, I would like to point out that one should not have overly high expectations that the 
work will lead to significantly more accurate forecasts. We will probably have to continue to live with 
some  surprises  in  the  economy.  This  applies  in  particular  when  structural  changes  in  the  economy 
change the historical pattern. 
But improving understanding of what has happened is still important. The cause behind fluctuations in 
inflation and growth is important for how monetary policy should be designed. 
The high productivity growth has meant that the Riksbank has been able to conduct an expansionary 
monetary policy. In other words, the economy has managed a high growth rate without prices rising 
much. Under these circumstances a natural question might be whether we should have cut the rate 
more in order to push up inflation towards the target more quickly?  
With  hindsight  it  is  fairly  easy  to  note  that  we  could  possibly  have  made  the  interest  rate  cuts  at  a 
slightly  faster  pace  when  we  began  making  cuts  a  few  years  ago.  We  have  already  noted  this  in 
various contexts and it is hardly controversial. 
On the other hand, I do not believe that it would have been wise to cut the rate much more in recent 
years.  In  2005  the  interest  rate  had  fallen  to  a  historically  low  level  of  1.5  per  cent.  Although  the 
Riksbank  predicted  in  2005  that  inflation  would  remain  low  in  2006,  albeit  rising  slightly,  we  were 
counting on strong growth in demand, partly due to the expansionary monetary policy. The low interest 
rates  had  also  led  to  a  rapid  rise  in  household  borrowing  and  house  prices.  If  we  had  tried  in  that 
situation to push up inflation more quickly by means of further interest rat cuts, I believe there was a 
risk that the economy would have overheated later on, with excessively high price and wage increases 
and other imbalances. In that case we would have been forced to tighten monetary policy much more 
than we now envisage. Ultimately, we would have risked an unstable economic development.  
Monetary policy’s ability to stabilise the economy 
Let  me  also  briefly  mention  in  this  context  the  question  of  monetary  policy’s  ability  to  stabilise  the 
economy in general.  
By considering how quickly we should aim to bring inflation back on target, we try to contribute to the 
most  stable  development  of  production  and  employment  possible.  But  the  fact  that  we  give 
consideration to the real economy when formulating monetary policy does not mean that we have any 
targets for employment or production. There are several reasons for this.  
Firstly, it could probably easily lead to unrealistic expectations of what we can achieve by raising and 
cutting the interest rate. Monetary policy cannot in the long run affect either production or employment. 
Well-judged adjustments in the interest rate can ensure a stable development of inflation in the long 
term.  In  addition,  monetary  policy  can,  at  best,  contribute  to  alleviating  cyclical  fluctuations  in 
production and unemployment. However, the interest rate is much too blunt an instrument to be able 
to fine-tune the economy to any great extent. 
Secondly, a production target or employment target would only be purposeful if we were fairly sure 
how large the growth potential of the economy was and what level of employment represented some 
form  of  equilibrium.  In  practice,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  this  with  any  great  precision.  Both 
potential growth and employment vary over time with structural changes in the economy in ways that 
are difficult to quantify.  
BIS Review 17/2007

Thirdly, an extra difficulty in this context is that the picture of how the economy develops changes over 
time as statistics are revised. This applies in particular to GDP statistics. It becomes particularly clear 
how difficult it would be for the Riksbank to have a target for productivity growth if one looks at how the 
statistics were revised at the end of 2004 and beginning of 2005. 
The  information  available  at  the  beginning  of  2005  indicated  a  fairly  clear  slowdown  in  production 
growth. Later on in 2005 the picture of a slowdown in the growth of the economy was confirmed, but it 
then appeared to have a more prolonged course of events. Since then the picture has been revised 
again,  and  now  the  economic  downturn  around  the  end  of  2004/beginning  of  2005  appears  much 
milder than was indicated by the statistics at that time. Today we have a new description of history to 
base our own assessments on.  
This type of statistical measuring problem was one of the things that made Francesco Giavazzi and 
Frederic  Mishkin  advice  against  having  targets  for  production  or  employment  in  their  evaluation  of 
Swedish monetary policy. I agree with them. The best we can do is to balance monetary policy so that 
the  economy  follows  what  is  roughly  considered  to  be  a  long-term  favourable  path.  This  balance 
should of course be within the scope of our inflation target. 
The current situation and monetary policy considerations  
This  seems  like  a  good  point  to  move  on  to  talk  about  the  Riksbank’s  current  views  on  inflation 
prospects.  
The economy has grown rapidly in recent years. Over the coming years we are expecting growth in 
the economy to slow down and approach a growth rate that is more sustainable in the long term. One 
reason is that our assessment is that international economic activity will slow down; another is that the 
productivity increases will slow down.  
Over the coming year, GDP growth nevertheless looks to be relatively high. Employment will rise and 
households will increase their consumption at a rapid rate.  
We are assuming that employment will continue to rise during the forecast period, albeit at a slower 
rate. This will lead to unemployment falling. When we make forecasts for the labour market, we also 
have  to  take  into  account  the  fact  that  the  labour  supply  will  increase  when  economic  activity 
strengthens.  This  is  a  normal  pattern.  The  Government’s  policy  will  probably  also  mean  that  the 
number  of  persons  in  the  labour  force  increases  slightly  more  than  has  been  usual  in  previous 
economic upturns. The fact that the labour supply increases will mean that unemployment will fall at a 
slower rate than employment rises.  
With regard to inflation, we expect it will fall over the coming six months. It is the large fluctuations in 
energy prices that make an impact on inflation in the short term. We cannot – and should not – do 
much about this type of short-term fluctuation in inflation. In the longer term we are expecting inflation 
to rise and be close to 2 per cent two years ahead. 
One might wonder, if inflation is now expected to fall in the short term, what reason do we have to 
believe that it will rise to 2 per cent in the longer term?  
One  important  reason  for  this  forecast  is  that  productivity  growth  should  be  more  modest  in  future. 
Over  the  past  two  years  we  have  been  able  to  note  that  productivity  growth  has  slowed  down 
compared with the years before that. This indicates that productivity growth is about to slacken to a 
more normal level, seen from a long-term perspective.  
As employment rises and the lack of labour increases, it is also reasonable to assume that the rate of 
wage  increase  will  be  gradually  raised.  The  Riksbank’s  forecast  assumes  that  wage  increases  will 
grow as resource utilisation in the labour market rises.  
A rising rate of wage increase and a stabilisation of productivity increases at a more normal level will 
mean  that  cost  pressures  in  the  economy  increase  in  the  coming  years.  With  more  rapid  cost 
increases, price increases will also be greater in the long term.  
There is thus good reason to believe that inflation will increase during the forecast period. At the same 
time, what we are expecting is a modest upturn in inflation, despite a strong upturn in employment and 
relatively  high  GDP  growth.  This  is  due  to  continuing  favourable  supply  conditions.  For  one  thing, 
productivity growth is expected to remain at a relatively high level, and for another thing the labour 
supply will probably increase more than during previous economic upturns. A larger supply of labour 
4 
 BIS Review 17/2007
will  hold  back  the  pressure  for  higher  wage  increases.  Moreover,  it  appears  that  international  price 
pressures will remain high. These hold back price increases on imported goods. 
But  I  would  also  like  to  emphasise  that  the  inflation  forecast  is  uncertain.  This  is  illustrated  by  the 
uncertainty bands around the inflation forecast that is included in our report. The uncertainty bands are 
based on the Riksbank’s historical forecasting errors. Their breadth indicates that it is not particularly 
meaningful to focus on tenths of percentage points in inflation.  
But the uncertainty bands also show that there is a large probability that inflation will remain within the 
tolerance interval of 1-3 per cent over the coming years. It is also worth reminding that inflation seen 
over a longer period of time has not on average deviated significantly from the target.  
In our current assessment the rate of wage increase is particularly uncertain. On the one hand, the 
fact  that  many  agreements  in  the  labour  market  will  be  renegotiated  in  a  favourable  labour  market 
situation entails a risk that wages will increase more than we had assumed in our main scenario. On 
the  other  hand,  it  is  also  possible  that  we  are  underestimating  how  much  the  labour  supply  may 
increase. This means there is also a downside risk for wages. As before, we cannot ignore that there 
are  risks  linked  to  the  rapid  increase  in  house  prices  and  loans.  Imbalances  could  build  up.  When 
imbalances sooner or later have to be corrected, this can lead to undesirable fluctuations in inflation 
and the real economy.  
At our most recent monetary policy meeting we weighed these risks and considerations against one 
another.  This  resulted  in  the  assessment  that  the  repo  rate  needed  to  be  raised  by  a  further  0.25 
percentage points and that it would then need to be raised once more over the coming six months. 
After that we considered it would be probably possible to pause before making a further increase.  
In  our  Monetary  Policy  Report  we  highlight  two  other  possible  interest  rate  paths  to  show  the 
considerations that need to be made. One of these involves the interest rate being raised at a slower 
pace and the other a more rapid pace than in the main scenario. With our current knowledge of the 
state of the economy and inflationary pressures, our assessment is that faster interest rate increases 
would lead to excessively low inflation. Correspondingly, slower interest rate increases would lead to 
excessively high inflation.  
Let me point out in conclusion that the inflation assessment we make now is not particularly different 
from the one we made in October, when we published our previous report. From the comments in the 
mass media, one might get the impression that the Riksbank had made a drastic change in its views of 
inflationary pressures in the economy. But this is not the case. On the other hand, we now believe that 
growth will be a little higher and employment growth will be stronger than we forecast in October. At 
the same time, it appears that the labour supply will increase a little more than we assumed then. Our 
inflation forecast therefore remains largely the same. 
Our assessment of the interest rate has therefore also changed very little. In October we based our 
inflation forecast on the market’s expectations of the development of the repo rate. The forecast for the 
repo rate that we presented last week agrees fairly well with the market expectations in October.  
But  this  does  not  mean  that  we  will  not  need  to  revise  our  assessment  in  the  future.  I  would  once 
again like to emphasise that the path for the interest rate is a forecast and therefore uncertain. It is not 
a  promise.  But  nevertheless  it  is  our  best  current  assessment  of  how  the  repo  rate will  need  to  be 
adjusted in the near future. It is reasonable that we report it in a similar manner to the way we talk 
about what we think will happen with production growth and the labour market and a number of other 
variables.  
Summary 
I have today emphasised that our decision to publish our own forecast for the interest rate should be 
regarded as a further step towards greater openness and clarity in monetary policy.  
When looking back, I observed that inflation in 2006 was held down by, among other things, the strong 
development in productivity. This has contributed to a high GDP growth without any significant rise in 
prices. Gaining a deeper understanding of the driving forces behind productivity growth is a difficult 
task. It is also an important one, to which we devote considerable effort.  
I  have  also  described  the  background  to  our  decision  to  raise  the  interest  rate  by  0.25  percentage 
points and to our assessment that a further increase is necessary over the coming six months before 
we  probably  pause  before  making  another  increase.  Continued  good  economic  activity  and  an 
BIS Review 17/2007 
 5
increase  in  employment  will  lead  to  inflation  rising  in  the  coming  years.  But  we  are  nevertheless 
assuming that the inflation upturn will be modest. This is due to continued favourable supply conditions 
in  the  economy.  Finally,  I  have  pointed  out  that  our  forecast,  as  always,  is  uncertain.  This  applies 
equally to our interest rate forecast. 
Thank you!
