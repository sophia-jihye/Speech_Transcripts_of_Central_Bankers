Thomas Jordan: Are special regulations needed for private equity? 
Summary of an address by Mr Thomas Jordan, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National 
Bank, in the series "Germany and Switzerland, partners in dialogue", Berlin, 9 May 2007. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The  topic  of  private  equity  and  its  regulation  currently  appear  to  be  provoking  heated  debate  and 
dividing opinion on an almost unprecedented scale. This address will consider the regulation of private 
equity from three different vantage points: first, the regulation of private equity as an economic activity; 
second,  its  regulation  for  reasons  of  financial  stability;  third,  the  regulation  of  private  equity  as  an 
investment  vehicle.  Taken  as  a  whole,  it  is  important  that  we  maintain  a  balance  when  regulating 
private  equity  to  ensure  that  opportunities  for  economic  growth  can  be  utilised  without  incurring 
excessive risks.
