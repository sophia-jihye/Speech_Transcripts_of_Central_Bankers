Stefan Ingves: Introduction on monetary policy 
Speech by Mr Stefan Ingves, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, to the Riksdag Commitee 
on Finance, Stockholm, 15 November 2007.  
 What  is  the  objective  of  the  Riksbank’s  monetary  policy?  To  maintain  price  stability  –  an 
inflation  rate  around  two  per  cent  a  year?  Yes,  this  is  of  course  correct.  But  behind  this 
wording there lies a deeper meaning – the actual core of the task delegated by the Riksdag 
(the Swedish parliament) and ultimately the Swedish people to the Riksbank. Because what 
it is essentially all about is to create the best possible conditions for good and sustainable 
economic development. And monetary policy contributes to this by keeping inflation low and 
stable. The inflation target is not merely a target, but also a means. 
The fact that I as Governor of the Riksbank have the opportunity to discuss monetary policy 
with you who represent the Riksdag is also important for the prospects of reaching this goal 
in the best possible way. The Riksbank must have support and legitimacy from the people to 
be able to succeed in its policy. It must therefore be easy to examine how monetary policy is 
conducted and how well we live up to our principles. The fact that the Riksbank Governor 
regularly  takes  part  in  these  hearings  is  an  important  part  of  this  process.  Our  task  also 
means  that  we  must  constantly  strive  to  become  better  at  what  we  do  and  develop  our 
working  methods.  We  must  adapt  to  new  demands  from  outside  and  implement  changes 
where  we  or  others  find  scope  for  improvement.  Evaluation  and  constructive  debate 
contribute to making us better at what we do. 
My  introduction  on  monetary  policy  here  today  will  in  a  way  deal  with  evaluation  and 
development.  I  shall  talk  about  the  contents  of  our  Monetary  Policy  Report  –  our  view  of 
inflation  prospects,  the  decision  at  the  end  of  October  to  raise  the  repo  rate  by  0.25 
percentage points and what interest rate policy we believe will be required over the coming 
years. The report is one of the best tools for examining how well we do our job. But I will also 
talk about some changes we have made to better meet the requirements made of us, not 
least in our role as independent authority. 
Because if I summarise what has happened in monetary policy since I was here in February, 
it is not merely a question of the forecasts and interest rate decisions we have published. We 
have also made changes in the way we communicate, to become clearer and more open. 
There have been fairly lively discussions of this over the past year. 
It is good that the Riksbank’s strategy is discussed. But I sometimes think that it has been 
difficult to distinguish whether the criticism concerns our forecasts not being considered good 
enough  or whether  it  concerns  our  changes  in  communication.  It is of  course  important  to 
distinguish between on the one hand our policy and our assessments, and on the other hand 
the  way  we  communicate  them  –  our  communication  strategy.  I  therefore  wish  to  discuss 
these  areas  separately  today.  Moreover,  there  are  other  new  elements  that  have  been 
discussed with the Committee on Finance and are linked to the ambition to become clearer 
and more open. So let me begin there – by briefly discussing the changes we have made 
recently  and  why  we  have  made  them.  After  that  I  will  go  on  to  talk  about  the  economic 
situation and interest rate policy. 
Changes for better monetary policy 
The driving forces behind greater openness and clarity 
Both the Riksbank and most other central banks have become more open and clear in recent 
years (slide 1). This is partly because we have seen it as a way to easier attain our target 
BIS Review 132/2007

and  to  make  monetary  policy  more  efficient.  By  being  open  about  the  way  we  think,  it  is 
easier for others to predict our monetary policy. It will also be easier for the general public to 
make sure that the interest rate decisions we make are really aimed at achieving low and 
stable  inflation.  This  increases  the  credibility  of  the  inflation  target  and  makes  it  easier  to 
anchor  expectations  around  two  per  cent.  Developments  in  Sweden  from  the  mid-1990s 
onwards are a good example of this (slide 2). 
And  by  being  clear  about  how  we  view  future  monetary  policy  we  can  also  increase  the 
efficiency of monetary policy (slide 1). It is not merely the current interest rate decision and 
the current level of the interest rate that are important to future inflation and demand in the 
economy.  Households  and  companies  do  not  base  their  financial  decisions  only  on  the 
current interest rates. Expectations of how the repo rate will develop over the coming years 
are at least as important. 
But there are also other reasons for the increased openness. As I mentioned earlier, public 
support and legitimacy are a fundamental requirement for monetary policy to work. We have 
freedom  with  responsibility  and  with  this  come  demands  for  insight  and  accountability. 
Openness  is  also  something  that  has  long  imbued  Swedish  public  administration.  The 
principle of free public access which means that public authorities' activities shall as far as 
possible  be  carried  out  openly,  was  established  as  early  as  the  late  18th  century,  a  time 
when few other countries had such ideas. So this is a long tradition we are maintaining. 
The  fact  that  we  are  examined  closely  is  also  something  that  affects  the  efficiency  of  our 
work. The more open we are, the easier it is for a member of the Committee on Finance or 
any  other  member  of  society  to  evaluate  how  well  monetary  policy  works.  Clarity  and 
increased openness outwards lead to a better discussion of monetary policy. In this way it 
functions as an extra incentive for us to become even more efficient within the walls of the 
Riksbank.  
Changes in our way of communicating 
So what are the changes that these driving forces have resulted in over the past year (slide 
3)? There are primarily two changes involved. One is that we have followed the example of 
the  central  banks  in  New  Zealand  and  Norway  and  now  publish  our  own  forecast  for  the 
future  interest  rate.  The  other  is  that  representatives  of  the  Riksbank  no  longer  signal  in 
advance, through speeches and press releases, how they consider the interest rate should 
be set at the next meeting. 
There  has  perhaps  been  less  focus  on  a  couple  of  other  changes,  but  these  are  also 
important components in the whole that makes the strategy for our communication. Since the 
summer  we  now  publish  in  the  minutes  the  names  of  Executive  Board  members  as  they 
express their opinions in the discussion at the monetary policy meeting. We now hold press 
conferences in connection with all of the now 6 monetary policy meetings a year. From this 
December we will publish an interest rate forecast in connection with each of these meetings. 
Previously  the  interest  rate  path  has  only  been  published in  connection  with  the Monetary 
Policy Reports issued three times a year. 
We have already discussed the interest rate path here in the Committee on Finance, but not 
the  question  of  signalling.  It  is  true  that  the  signalling  has  been  discussed  in  several 
speeches by Executive Board members. But as the idea behind these hearings is that I shall 
give an account of what has happened since the last time I was here, it seems appropriate to 
take up this issue again. 
Earlier the Riksbank applied something that I have on a couple of occasions described as 
“signalling  by  degrees”.  Between  the  monetary  policy  meetings  the  individual  Executive 
Board members sometimes held speeches where we more or less explicitly indicated how 
we thought the interest rate should be set at the next meeting. The idea was that sufficient 
2 
 BIS Review 132/2007
information  on  how  the  Executive  Board  reasoned  should  have  come  out  by  degrees  to 
prevent economic agents being taken by surprise when the interest rate decision was made. 
But  since  we  began  publishing  our  own  interest  rate  forecast  the  need  for  this  type  of 
signalling  between  the  monetary  policy  meetings  has  declined.  Now  that  we  will  also  be 
publishing our interest rate forecasts every second month, the need has declined further. The 
general public and the financial markets will now receive at fairly regular intervals a detailed 
description of how a majority of the Executive Board members consider that the repo rate 
should be set in the future. This is one of several reasons why we have stopped signalling in 
speeches prior to coming interest rate decisions, unless there are special circumstances. 
There  were  also  some  problems  with  the  earlier  signalling  which  we  wanted  to  avoid.  In 
certain situations it was probably difficult to determine whether the signal in a speech should 
be  interpreted  as  an  individual  member’s  opinion  or  whether  it  reflected  the  views  of  a 
majority on the Executive Board. If the individual Board members sent out different signals it 
could  probably  also  be  difficult  to  distinguish  a  clear  message.  In  addition,  it  was  unclear 
when and if the signals should be sent out. 
Finally, and at least as important in my opinion, there was also a democratic aspect to this 
question.  This  has  to  do  with  the  fact  that  we  are  an  independent  authority  and  that  the 
general public should have good insight into the decision-making process. There must be no 
doubt that the interest rate decisions are actually made at the monetary policy meetings and 
not at some other, more diffuse, point in time – in some informal way that prevents insight. If 
the  signalling  prior  to  the  meetings leads  people  to  believe  that  the  interest  rate decisions 
have been made in advance of the meetings, then doubts may arise. 
Why has this led to a debate? 
The fact that the debate on our communication has been fairly lively probably has several 
explanations. To begin with, the pace of our development towards openness and clarity has 
been fairly high over the past two years. And if one makes a lot of changes in a short time it 
is  not  so  surprising  that  discussions  arise.  Because  even  if  one  has  prepared  the  way, 
changes  often  mean  that  all  those  involved  must  undergo  a  period  of  “learning  by  doing” 
before everything falls into place. This applies not least to us, I would like to emphasise. 
The changes also mean, in particular our own interest rate forecast, that we are now sticking 
out our necks and opening up for criticism more than before. When we describe our policy it 
is no longer in the form of a simple, but perhaps slightly misleading policy rule. This was the 
way  things  were  before  when  we  used  the  more  easily  understood,  but  less  realistic, 
assumption of an unchanged repo rate. Instead we are painting a more complex picture, the 
way  it  actually  looks  to us  who  make  the  decisions.  Slightly  more  complicated  on  the  one 
hand,  but  on  the  other  hand  more  realistic  and  with  significantly  better  opportunities  to 
evaluate our work! 
The fact that we are publishing our own forecast for the policy rate also means that it will be 
very  clear  when  we  reconsider  our  view  of  what  interest  rate  policy  will  be  needed  in  the 
future.  It  also  becomes  evident  when  our  assessment  differs  from  that  of  the  market,  and 
these differences often cause a debate. But the fact that we are criticised for changing our 
minds, or for our views being different from the market view, is hardly a reason to refrain from 
reporting  as  honestly  as  possible  what  we  believe.  The  fact  that  we  changed  our  view  or 
made  a  different  assessment  than  the  market  also  happened  before,  when  our  forecasts 
were based on the assumption of an unchanged repo rate. The difference was merely that it 
did not show as much as there was no interest rate forecast to use as comparison. 
But  it  is  important  to  distinguish  between  what  is  criticism  of  the  Riksbank’s  economic 
assessments and what is criticism of the actual communication strategy. At the time as we 
published  the  first  interest  rate  paths  and  stopped  "signalling  by  degrees”,  our  view  of 
economic  developments  differed  from  many  market  agents’  analyses.  I  believe  that  this 
BIS Review 132/2007 
 3
contributed  to  criticism  that  actually  dealt  with  differences  in  economic  assessments  partly 
spreading  to  the  changes  in  our  communication.  It  is  too  early  to  assess  as  yet,  but  I  am 
convinced  that  the  advantages  of  our  new  method  of  communicating  will  in  the  long  term 
outweigh any disadvantages. 
I would like to emphasise that an open and constructive debate is something we welcome. 
We  will  not  refrain  from  changes  that  we  believe  lead  to  a  better  monetary  policy,  just 
because we risk being criticised in the process. This would be a very bad strategy and does 
not fit in with our task. We believe that the best way to conduct monetary policy is to explain 
as openly and honestly as possible both what we are doing and how we are thinking. And 
this is definitely something the general public can require of us in our role as independent 
authority. 
All of these changes are steps in that direction. Steps we have taken to become clearer and 
more open – to become more efficient in our way of communicating. I would also like to point 
out  that  much  of  what  we  have  done  is  in  line  with  questions  discussed  here  in  the 
Committee  on  Finance.  This  emphasises  the  importance  of  using  debate  and  dialogue  to 
reach  new  solutions.  We  essentially  all  want  the  same  thing  –  to  create  in  the  best  way 
possible the right conditions for good and sustainable economic growth. 
Other changes 
The Committee on Finance itself has also initiated several changes that contribute to good 
discussions  on  monetary  policy  (slide  4).  One  change  I  am  thinking  of  is  the  fact  that  the 
hearing  with  the  Governor  of  the  Riksbank  now  takes  place  a  couple  of  weeks  after  the 
Monetary Policy Report has been published and that experts can be called in to assist the 
Committee, if necessary. Of course, it means I have to answer more difficult questions the 
more time you have had to prepare yourselves. But this is how it should be and something 
positive for all parties. 
I  would  also  like  to  mention  another  new  element  –  a  change  of  name  which  was  largely 
initiated by the Committee on Finance. I am referring to the measure of underlying inflation 
calculated as CPI adjusted for households’ mortgage interest expenditure. It also excludes 
the direct effects of changes in indirect taxes and subsidies. This measure was previously 
called UND1X. This name referred to the fact that it was a measure of underlying inflation, 
but probably appeared a little too cryptic. I remember that I may have let slip that I thought it 
sounded like the name of a rocket fuel during my first hearing. The new and hopefully slightly 
less difficult name since a week ago is CPIX, where the X indicates that something has been 
excluded from the CPI. 
This  takes  me  onto  today’s  second  theme,  namely  inflation  prospects,  our  most  recent 
interest rate decision and our view of what monetary policy will be appropriate in the future. 
The economic situation and future prospects 
It  can  hardly  have  escaped  the  attention  of  anyone  here  today  that  we  now  base  our 
forecasts on our own assessment of what future movements in the repo rate we believe will 
provide  a  well-balanced  monetary  policy.  So  before  I  take  up  the  rest  of  the  economic 
analysis, I shall first describe the interest rate assumption. Our analysis is based partly on 
the increase in the repo rate of 0.25 percentage points to 4 per cent which we decided on 
just over two weeks ago, and partly on the fact that the interest rate will need to be raised 
slightly further in the future – to around 4.25 per cent during the first half of 2008. So how did 
we reach this assessment?

A strong Swedish economy with increased cost and inflationary pressures… 
If we begin with the situation at home, it is clear that the Swedish economy is continuing to 
show strong growth (slide 5). We see increased cost and inflationary pressures ahead of us 
and there are a couple of main factors in this development that I wish to highlight. 
Strong growth 
Both the statistics in the National Accounts and the survey of Swedish companies carried out 
by  the  Riksbank  confirm  the  picture  of  strong  growth  in  Sweden.  Although  the  rate  of 
increase in GDP has slowed down slightly, it remains fairly high and is expected to be around 
3  per  cent  this  year.  Our  assessment  is  that  we  are  in  a  situation  where  we  are  currently 
making more use of economic resources than normal. 
If we look ahead, we are expecting GDP to grow slightly more slowly up to 2010 than it has 
in recent years. This is due to several interacting factors; we believe that productivity and the 
labour  supply  will  increase  more  slowly,  and  that  international  growth  will  be  lower.  In 
addition, we are expecting the interest rate to rise gradually, the exchange rate to be stronger 
and investment to increase at a slower rate. These factors subdue growth.  
… and tighter labour market 
Despite the fact that GDP growth has been strong for several years, it was not until 2005 that 
employment began to increase (slide 6). And in 2006 both the number of hours worked and 
the  number  of  persons  employed  rose  quite  substantially.  This  was  partly  because  the 
number of people in employment measures increased considerably during the fourth quarter 
of  last  year.  But  despite  the  fact  that  fewer  people  are  in  labour  market  programmes  this 
year,  the  number  of  employed  has  continued  to  increase.  This  indicates  considerable 
strength  in  the  labour  market.  We  also  assess  that  employment  will  continue  to  increase 
during the forecast period, but at a slower rate. The fact that the pace slows down is due to 
the  economic  upturn  slackening.  It  is  also  due  to  higher  wage  increases  contributing  to  a 
lower demand for labour. 
The  supply  of  labour  has  also  increased,  but  not  as  much  as  employment.  Open 
unemployment  has  thus  fallen  (slide  7).  According  to  our  forecast,  the  labour  supply  will 
continue to increase, albeit at a slower rate, during the forecast period. This development is 
mainly due to the economic cycle, but also to some of the Government’s measures. The fact 
that the rate of increase is slowing down is due to the economic upturn slackening, and also 
to  factors  such  as  the  number  of  persons  in  the  age  groups  with  high  participation  in  the 
labour  force  declining.  All  in  all,  this  will  lead  to  the  number  of  open  unemployed  persons 
continuing to fall, but at an ever slower rate. Compared with what we were expecting in June, 
the conditions in the labour market have become tighter. 
This means in turn that it is reasonable to assume that wages will rise more quickly (slide 8). 
And the agreements signed so far support this picture. The new agreements will make an 
impact  in  2008,  and  the  labour  shortages  will  also  become  more  marked  then.  We  are 
therefore counting on wages increasing more during next year than in 2007, by around 4.5 
per cent. Labour costs per hour are also expected to increase. How this affects companies’ 
costs for the goods they produce will in turn depend on how productivity develops.  
Productivity growing more slowly and labour costs increasing 
If  one  looks  back  at  the  past  decade,  productivity  in  the  Swedish  economy  has  improved 
significantly (slide 9). This meant that production could increase more quickly than costs. It 
also contributed to employment showing fairly weak development over a long period, despite 
good growth. 
But more recently employment has increased, while productivity growth has been lower. We 
believe that the slower productivity growth is to some extent temporary. There can be several 
BIS Review 132/2007 
 5
reasons  for  this.  One  reason  is  probably  that  new  persons  are  being  employed  in  the 
companies and that it quite simply takes time before they are fully productive. Another could 
be that new groups are entering the labour market. For instance, the service sector normally 
increases  fairly  late  in  an  economic  cycle  and  then  the  productivity  measured  is  slightly 
weaker.  Something  that  further  fuelled  the  slowdown  in  productivity  during  the  second 
quarter this year was the low holiday absence in June, which we assess to be a temporary 
effect. Our forecast is that productivity will once again accelerate, but increase at a slower 
rate than it has in recent years. 
If one looks at the forecasts for the labour market and productivity together, one can also see 
that  companies’  costs  in  production  are  expected  to  increase  more  rapidly  than  in  recent 
years. Unit labour costs are rising according to our assessment, by 4.8 per cent a year, but 
the rate of increase will then fall back as productivity begins to increase more rapidly once 
again. 
Expectations confirm the picture of increased cost and inflationary pressures 
If I very briefly summarise the domestic situation, the wheels of the Swedish economy are 
turning at a good pace. We have a high level of utilisation of economic resources and cost 
pressures are increasing. Something that supports this picture is that both households and 
companies have adjusted their inflation expectations upwards, according to various surveys. 
And  if  one  instead  measures  inflation  expectations  by  looking  at  the  difference  between 
nominal and real bonds, the results point in the same direction. 
… is counteracted by slightly weaker international developments 
International developments appear to provide some counterbalance to the slightly stronger 
Swedish  economy.  Although  we  are  counting  on  international  growth  being  good,  it  will 
probably be lower than we predicted in June. There has been unrest in the financial markets, 
particularly in recent months, and there have been signs of weaker economic growth in the 
United States and the euro area, among others (slide 10). But at the same time we are now 
expecting  slightly  higher  growth  in  other  parts  of  the  world,  including  Asia  and  eastern 
Europe.  Our  view  of  growth  in  the  world  economy  is  therefore  only  marginally  changed. 
Nevertheless,  our  assessment  is  that  the  slowdown  in  among  others  the  United  States, 
together with the unrest in the financial markets will slow down economic developments in 
Sweden somewhat. I would therefore like to take the opportunity to say a few words about 
this, as it has received so much attention in recent months. 
The financial unrest and how it affects the Swedish economy 
The  weaker  growth  in  the  United  States  and  the  anxiety  that  has  arisen  in  the  financial 
markets  is  largely  linked  to  the  problems  in  the  US  housing  and  mortgage  markets.  This 
concerns above all the market for sub-prime loans. These are, somewhat simplified, loans to 
households that do not have sufficient credit rating to be granted a normal mortgage. 
During  the  summer  there  were  signs  that  all  was  not  well.  The  number  of  households 
experiencing  difficulties  in  paying  their  mortgages  had  gradually  increased.  The  unrest 
intensified  when  it  was  revealed  that  several  financial  institutions  had  made  substantial 
losses  related  to  the  sub-prime  market.  The  fact  that  an  apparently  national  problem  has 
global effects to the extent that we have seen is due in this case very much to the fact that 
the loans have been "repackaged" into fairly technically complicated securities and sold on to 
investors around the world. And the unrest that has arisen has largely been concerned with 
the fact that it is difficult to see who is bearing the credit risks, and to what extent. 
These events have had several effects. There has been a more general reassessment of risk 
in the financial markets. The general uncertainty has led to an increase in demand for liquid 
and safe assets such as government securities. The interest rate on government securities 
has fallen, while the unwillingness to take on risk has contributed to rising interest rates on 
6 
 BIS Review 132/2007
loans and investments between banks; interbank rates (slide 11). But all in all, it nevertheless 
appears as though the financial turbulence has so far not had as large repercussions on the 
financial markets as, for instance, the Asia crisis in 1997 and the IT crash in 2000. 
What effects can we expect on the Swedish economy? Perhaps the most important effect will 
arise in that growth in the United States will slow down when housing investments there fall 
and households consume less. The lower demand in the United States to some extent slows 
down international economic activity and there will be a slightly slower increase in Swedish 
exports. The financial unrest will probably also contribute to Swedish households maintain a 
certain  level  of  precautionary  saving.  The  fact  that  it  costs  more  for  banks  to  finance 
themselves may also contribute to households and companies sooner or later facing dearer 
loans. 
But there is considerable uncertainty over how extensive the effects of the financial unrest 
and the US housing market will finally be. We therefore analyse an alternative scenario with 
weaker international growth in our Monetary Policy Report. 
Prospects for inflation and interest rates 
We are expecting inflation to rise fairly sharply next year (slide 12). This is partly connected 
to energy prices rising more rapidly. But inflation is rising even adjusted for energy prices. 
And the reasons are primarily that utilisation of the economy’s resources and cost pressures 
have  increased.  Moreover,  there  are  signs  that  food  prices  will  increase  rapidly  over  the 
coming year. Inflation measured in terms of CPI will amount to around 3 per cent in 2008, 
according  to  our  forecast.  The  measures  of  underlying  inflation,  CPIX,  which  I  recently 
mentioned, will in our opinion rise from the current level to around the target next year. The 
differences  between  the  measures  are  largely  due  to  households’  mortgage  expenditure 
increasing and to higher indirect costs. When the economic cycle enters a calmer phase, the 
CPIX will fall back to levels around 2 per cent, while the CPI will remain slightly higher. This 
is our assessment, given that we raise the repo rate in the way I described earlier. 
The interest rate decision and our forecast for the interest rate 
To summarise, one can say that two forces are pulling in opposite directions (slide 13). One 
is the stronger development here at home, and the other is a slightly weaker demand abroad. 
But even if we expect that slightly poorer international growth will have a dampening effect 
on the Swedish economy, this is not sufficient to hold back the increased cost pressures. The 
interest rate therefore needs to be raised, and this was what we did around two weeks ago 
(slide 14). 
With regard to the future repo rate, our forecast remains largely the same as in June, despite 
the fact that a lot has happened in the world economy since then. So to keep the underlying 
inflation rate around our target of 2 per cent a couple of years ahead, our assessment is that 
it is necessary to raise the repo rate slightly further in the future – to around 4.25 per cent 
during the first half of 2008. This interest rate policy should at the same time contribute to 
balanced growth in production and employment.  
A couple of words about uncertainty – a forecast and not a promise 
There  is  always  considerable  uncertainty  regarding  future  economic  events.  This  means 
there  is  also  considerable  uncertainty  regarding  future  repo  rate  movements.  The  interest 
rate path we have published is a forecast. It is not a promise! 
There  are  primarily  two  risk  scenarios  involved  this  time.  If  cost  pressures  become  higher 
than in the main scenario, the Riksbank may need to raise the repo rate more. This could 
occur if wages rise more quickly or if productivity increases more slowly than expected. If the 
financial unrest persists and international economic activity will be weaker than expected, the 
interest rate may instead need to be lower. The direction for monetary policy in practice will 
BIS Review 132/2007 
 7
depend  on  how  new  information  on  economic  developments  abroad  and  in  Sweden  will 
affect the prospects for economic activity and inflation. (Slide 15) 
Conclusion 
The Swedish economy is doing well. And the essential purpose of our work is to ensure good 
economic growth that is sustainable in the long term. As things look today, we are assuming 
that the interest rate path in our forecast will contribute to inflation being in line with our target 
around two years ahead. We believe that this will at the same time contribute to a balanced 
development in production and employment. (Slide 16) 
And we also believe that the changes we have made in our communication will help enable 
us to fulfil the requirements made of us in a better way. We have made the changes in our 
communication to become even clearer and more open. We always have this ambition, and 
have had it since the inflation target was introduced. 
But it is not merely with regard to communication that we are constantly reviewing and trying 
to  develop  our  methods  of  working.  No,  it  applies  of  course  to  all  parts  of  our  activities  – 
everything from our way of making forecasts to how the organisation looks and how we can 
improve the opportunities to assess how well we are doing. And an important part of this is 
discussions like the one we are having today.  
Thank you!
