Paul Tucker: Money and credit – banking and the macroeconomy 
Speech  by  Mr  Paul  Tucker,  Executive  Director  and  Member  of  the  Monetary  Policy 
Committee  of  the  Bank  of  England,  at  the  Monetary  Policy  and  the  Markets  Conference, 
London, 13 December 2007. 
My thanks for comments and/or for background work to Peter Andrews, Charlie Bean, Tim Besley, Roger Clews, 
Andy  Haldane,  Colin  Miles,  James  Proudman  and  Iain  de  Weymarn.  Special  thanks  to  Jing  Yang  and  Alex 
Haberis. For comments and background work to Damien Lynch. And for secretarial support to Sandra Bannister 
and Cheryl Feeney.  
 Each  month  the  MPC  sets  a  policy  rate,  Bank  Rate,  that  will  prevail  until  our  next  policy 
meeting. But no one – here today, in the market, or on the Committee – thinks that setting 
the  overnight  money  market  rate  for  the  coming  30  days  can  be  enough  to  steer  demand 
conditions and maintain stable inflation. Rather, policy works on the basis of expectations of 
the path of the Bank Rate in the future, and of how our policy settings will vary according to 
economic conditions: the so-called “reaction function”.  
Perceptions of the reaction function therefore matter a lot and a great deal of effort goes into 
being transparent about the three inputs: the Committee’s objective; the MPC’s views on the 
shocks to demand and supply affecting the economy; and our views on how the economy 
works  and  how  our  policy  settings  affect  it.  This  conference  is  focused  on  one  important 
element  of  this:  the  role  of  financial  markets  in  the  setting  and  transmission  of  monetary 
policy. That is covered in the Bank’s publications on how the economy works, including the 
Committee’s  1999  paper  on  the  Monetary  Transmission  Mechanism  (MTM),  and  books 
describing  the  models  used  in  forecasting.1  But  those  high-level  descriptions  miss  out  an 
awful lot about how the real and financial parts of the economy connect. Financial variables 
are  limited  to  the  short-term  interest  rate,  the  exchange  rate,  and  equities.  Nothing  on  the 
role of long-maturity interest rates, or on credit spreads and risk premia – which misses out a 
whole universe of financial asset prices. Very little on credit more generally. Next to nothing 
on money. And nothing at all on the role of bank intermediation. 
These  gaps  were  perhaps  underlined  by  a  degree  of  confusion  amongst  commentators 
about  the  way  in  which  Money  and  Credit  featured  somewhat  more  prominently  in  the 
Committee’s discussions during the backend of 2006 and into this year (Chart 1). With both 
having been strong for a while, some asked whether this marked some kind of change in the 
reaction function, implying a greater stress on nominal variables. 
Given  the  near  identity  of  deposits  and  bank  lending,  Money  and  Credit  are  often  used 
almost inseparably, even interchangeably, with wider measures of non-bank credit looked at 
only  when  assessing  the  health  of  corporate and  household  sector  balance  sheets.  But  in 
some circumstances one can do better to approach things the other way round, starting with 
general credit conditions, examining the interactions of non-bank and bank lending, and then 
broad money as a (partial) counterpart to M4L. My remarks today will follow that structure, 
which will provide a framework for some observations about the current tightening in credit 
conditions, as well as about the preceding expansion.

Credit 
Credit is, of course, vital to any economy, enabling households and firms to make choices 
about whether to bring forward or defer spending from income. There are conditions in which 
it would play no active role, passively reflecting cyclical fluctuations in output, employment 
and  inflation.  In  a  world  of  more  or  less  complete  transparency  between  borrowers  and 
lenders, very low transactions costs, and very low risk aversion, access to credit would not 
be  rationed;  and  ex  ante  yields  on  financial  assets,  including  loans  and  bonds,  would  not 
embody risk premia. So if households and firms wanted to bring forward spending in the face 
of shocks to the economy, they would be able to do so restricted only by their need to remain 
solvent.  
But  nobody  believes  that  that  is  a  description  of  the  real  world  in  which  households  and 
companies  manage  their  affairs.  Both  are,  to  a  greater  or  lesser  degree,  rationed  in  their 
access  to  credit,  given  that  borrowers  know  a  great  deal  more  about  their  conditions  and 
prospects  than  do  risk-averse  lenders,  and  that  lenders  face  obstacles  in  ensuring  that 
borrowers  honour  their  contracts.2  The  availability,  price  and  terms  of  credit–  whether 
unsecured or secured – will be sensitive to a range of factors, including assessments of the 
idiosyncratic  risks  of  a  particular  borrower,  and  the  risks  common  across  borrowers. 
Variations in these factors give rise to the possibility of a credit cycle.  
A borrower’s ability to pledge collateral can help to overcome the problems of “asymmetric 
information” and enforceability, by evidencing its net worth and giving it a continuing stake in 
its contract with the lender. This can give rise to the so-called “financial accelerator” channel 
of the Monetary Transmission Mechanism (MTM), in which monetary policy works partly by 
affecting lending terms through its effect on asset values and so the net worth of borrowers.3  
But credit conditions also depend on the access to credit of the lenders themselves. There is 
an important distinction here between intermediation across bank balance sheets and via the 
capital markets, although as I shall describe it turns out to be blurred.  
Total credit: capital markets and securitisation 
For  the  moment,  I  shall  put  that  distinction  to  one  side  in  order  to  focus  on  total  credit.  A 
series of environmental changes over the past decade or so have affected the quantity and 
price of credit generally. Greater macroeconomic stability, and perceptions that it will persist 
more  or  less  uninterrupted,  probably  increased  the  supply  of  credit;  and  by  reducing  risk 
premia, may have increased demand too (Diagram A).  
Other developments are more likely to have worked purely through credit supply. The most 
obvious is the growth of instruments such as credit derivatives and securitisation, associated 
with an increased role for rating agencies in monitoring credit risk. This was in effect a shock 
to  technology,  making  portfolios  transferable.  By  offering  the  prospect  of  better  meeting 
desired risk profiles and by separating origination from investment, it has brought more non-
bank financial institutions, and so more capital resources, into the credit markets, increasing 
the supply of credit (Diagram B). 
This  seems  to  have  been  borne  out  in  the  significant  shift  in  actual  credit  quantities  and 
prices up to the middle of this year.  
In  the  United  Kingdom,  non-bank  lenders  have  accounted  for  a  greater  share  of  credit 
extension to both the household and corporate sectors (Charts 2-4).

that,  especially 
the  corporate  sector  (Chart  8).  An 
for  sub-investment  grade  borrowers, 
A lot of that has been securitised (Chart 5). For the household sector, spreads on securitised 
portfolios of both secured and unsecured credit fell between 2003 and 2005 (Chart 6). That 
will have contributed to the fall in effective rates on the underlying mortgages and personal 
loans (Chart 7).  
illustrative 
The  same  broad  picture  holds 
decomposition  suggests 
the 
compression of spreads could not be explained solely by reduced compensation for default 
risk, with the excess possibly reflecting lower liquidity premia (Chart 9).4  
These falls in spreads were material relative to the changes in the MPC’s Bank Rate and to 
the risk-free yield curve. For example, in the latest “policy cycle”, we increased Bank Rate by 
125bp  over  11  months  from  August  2006.  During  that  period,  effective  rates  on  new 
mortgages  rose  by  closer  to  50bp.  In  other  words,  from  around  2003,  monetary  policy 
needed to take account of a progressive loosening of credit conditions.  
The  tables  have  now  turned.  Spreads  have  risen;  the  issuance  of  securitised  portfolios  of 
household  loans  has  collapsed;  corporate  bond  issuance  has  fallen  (Charts  10-11).  It  is 
pretty clear that, for the time being, there has been an adverse shift in the supply of credit 
from  the  non-banking  sector.  In  part,  that  seems  to  be  due  to  investors  becoming  less 
confident that they can base decisions about exposures to complex credit portfolios on rating 
agency  ratings;  this  is  akin  to  lenders  deciding  that  their  monitoring  of  risk  was  less  good 
than  they  thought.  In  part,  it  is  due  to  various  types  of  non-bank  investor  in  credit  finding 
themselves facing actual or incipient liquidity pressures. Both as cause and effect, liquidity in 
the capital markets is impaired. This is apparent in the opening up of a so-called “negative 
basis” between the spreads on corporate bond and on equivalent credit-default swaps, which 
unbundle the transfer of credit risk from the provision of funds and so are less affected by 
liquidity hoarding (Chart 12).  
A twin-engine financial system?  
At various times over the past decade or so, it had been argued5 that the macroeconomy as 
a  whole  should  be  more  resilient  to  shocks  to  a  financial  system  with  “twin  engines”  – 
combining  capital  markets  with  banking  system  intermediation  of  savings  and  credit.  The 
argument  is  that  when  the  capital  markets  are  impaired,  banking  can  take  more  of  the 
burden,  and  vice  versa.  I  have  a  good  deal  of  sympathy  for  this  view  –  but  not  for  all 
circumstances.  It  rather  overstates  the  independence  of  capital  markets  and  banking,  as 
recent developments graphically demonstrate.  
First,  whether  through  financing  the  purchase  of  credit  assets  by  leveraged  funds  or 
warehousing  portfolios  prior  to  sale  or  providing  “liquidity  lines”  to  conduits  and  other 
investment vehicles, the banking system puts its capital and liquidity behind the distribution 
of credit risk to the wider asset-manager universe. As the official sector stressed over recent 
years, it is important to be clear about the circumstances in which risk can flow back to the 
banking system.6  
Second,  the  “twin  engines”  view  draws  too  absolute  a  line  between  banks  and  non-bank 
financial  intermediaries.  Alongside  other  asset  managers,  banks  have  been  material 
investors  in  securitised  credit.  In  some  respects,  it  may  be  more  useful  to  distinguish

between intermediaries on the basis of whether they undertake some combination of maturity 
transformation,  leveraging  their  balance  sheets,  and  mark-to-market  valuations.  Banks  are 
not alone in having these characteristics, and so there can be common shocks to bank and 
non-bank investors. In a recent series of papers,7 Hyun Shin has argued that balance sheet 
management  of  this  kind  amplifies  the  credit  cycle.  That  sounds  like  the  “financial 
accelerator”  model,  except  that  Shin’s  position  is  that  the  outcomes  can  exceed  those 
warranted by fundamentals. His argument is that in the upswing of a business cycle, the rise 
in  asset  values  increases  the  accounting  net  worth  of  banks  and  other  intermediaries, 
enabling them to leverage up their balance sheets. This expands credit; and increases the 
liquidity  in  capital  markets,  reducing  liquidity  premia  embodied  in  asset  prices;  and  so  on. 
And when the music stops, the process can be reversed as falls in asset values, leverage 
and liquidity feed on each other. (For Shin, the villain is mark-to-market accounting, although 
I would not want its virtues in reducing forbearance to be overlooked.) 
Thirdly, the “twin engines” view may place insufficient weight on banks having remained the 
principal  originators  of  credit,  given  that  small  firms  and  households  cannot  issue  bonds 
directly into the capital markets. It has been argued that the growth of markets for securitising 
loan portfolios made banks less relevant to overall credit conditions, and so to the business 
cycle, because a bank’s ability to originate credit becomes less intimately bound up with its 
own financial strength.8 But if, as currently, the capital markets’ appetite for securitised credit 
diminishes, a larger proportion of loans will after all remain on the balance sheets of banks.  
All this brings back into focus the potential macroeconomic relevance of bank lending.  
Bank lending 
The  economic  literature  on  the  “bank  lending”  channel  of  the  Monetary  Transmission 
Mechanism explores the conditions under which a tightening of monetary policy causes the 
terms  on  bank  lending  to  tighten  over  and  above  the  increase  in  risk-free  short-term  real 
rates. The literature has typically assumed (i) that a monetary policy tightening is effected by 
the  central  bank  withdrawing  reserves  from  the  system  (or  slowing  the  pace  of  reserves 
injection);  (ii)  that  banks  are  required  to  hold  a  proportion  of  transactions  deposits  in 
reserves, so that reduced reserves provision entails slower deposit growth; and (iii) that they 
do not have unrestricted access to liabilities that are not subject to reserves requirements, 
and so cannot fill the gap left by slower deposit growth and must, instead, slow loan growth, 
which they do by tightening credit conditions.9 The first two steps seem archaic. We effect 
monetary policy changes by controlling the price not the quantity of central bank money in 
the system; and, in the UK, banks choose their own reserves targets rather than having them 
determined by a balance sheet ratio of some kind.  
But  the  third  plank  in  these  models  –  restricted  access  to  non-deposit  liabilities,  whether 
capital-like or not – plainly is still relevant today. In a world of asymmetric information, banks 
do not have unrestricted access to resources, and we do not believe that a bank’s lending

behaviour  is  invariant  to  its  capital gearing  or  to  the  composition  of  its  liabilities.10  We  do, 
therefore,  face  questions  about  the  extent  to  which  a  shock  to  banks’  liquidity  or  capital 
resources can bring about a shift in credit conditions with macroeconomic effects that, other 
things  being  equal,  monetary  policy  should  seek  to  offset  in  order  to  maintain  aggregate 
demand in line with aggregate supply.  
Over  the  past  15  years  or  so,  when  banks  have  seemed  anything  but  restricted,  easier 
access to liquidity or capital may have brought about a progressive relaxation of bank lending 
conditions. That this featured in commentary on monetary policy rather less than the recent 
manifest tightening may say no more than that sharp contractions attract more attention than 
gradual expansions. In a similar vein, on the whole, research does better at identifying these 
“credit channel” mechanisms in the context of particular stressed episodes than in longer-run 
averages.11
Be that as it may, it is beyond doubt that there has recently been an adverse shock to bank 
balance  sheets  –  involving  capital,  liquidity,  and  a  potent  “asymmetric”  information 
mechanism  affecting  a  wide  range  of  banks.  I  will  pick  out  four  elements  in  the  story, 
involving liquidity, counterparty-credit risk and capital.  
First, near closure of the capital markets for leveraged loans, conduit and SIV commercial 
paper,  and  RMBS  has  left  banks  whose  business  model  is  “originate  and  distribute” 
unexpectedly  holding  on  to  loans  and,  in  addition,  facing  the  prospect  of  having  to  take 
assets  back  on  to  their  balance  sheets.  The  consequent  reintermediation  is  a  hit  to  both 
capital ratios and liquidity, as the banks have bigger books to fund. For these reasons alone, 
big  picture, banks  responded  from  August  onwards  by  tightening  loan  terms  and  hoarding 
liquidity.  
But the story does not end there. The second element is that access to resources (uninsured 
deposits)  from  outside  the  banking  sector  has  become  more  restricted  since  the  summer. 
While  the  new  risk-transfer  instruments  have  plainly  dispersed  risks,  lack  of  ex  ante 
disclosure left market participants highly uncertain about the scale and distribution of losses 
across the banking sector itself. On top of that, open-ended investment vehicles that have (or 
may have) themselves invested in structured-finance paper have felt compelled to preserve 
liquidity,  to  guard  against  redemption  risk.  And  one  significant  source  of  demand  for  bank 
hybrid-capital instruments over the past half-decade or so, the SIVs, has been turned off due 
to their own funding problems. Taken together, the upshot for the banking system has been a 
shortening in the maturity of wholesale deposits, and an intermittent tightening of access to 
hybrid capital instruments (Chart 13).  
Coming on top of an involuntary increase in risk-weighted assets and reduced access to term 
liquidity,  the  third  component  of  the  shock,  apparent  since  late  autumn,  has  been  some 
actual  impairment  of  capital  resources.  Large  banks  especially  have  progressively  written 
down  the  values  of  structured-finance  assets,  reflecting  deterioration  in  the  underlying 
position  of  the  US  household  sector  and  in  the  values  of  a  wide  range  of  leveraged 
instruments.  But  the  adjustment  is  drawn  out,  partly  due  to  uncertainty  about  appropriate 
mark-to-market valuations given the impaired liquidity in ABS markets. To avoid this process 
amplifying  the  credit  cycle,12  some  replenishment  of  common  equity  may  be  needed,  and 
has already begun.  
                                                 
10   In  a  Modigliani-Miller  world  of  perfect  capital  markets,  a  bank’s  overall  cost  of  funds  is  independent  of  its 
capital  and  funding  structure.  As  a  result  the  level  of  bank  capital  and  the  balance  of  wholesale  and  retail 
funding are not relevant to bank lending decisions and so do not affect the monetary transmission mechanism.

The  fourth  element  in  the  story,  underway  since  August,  has  been  distributional.  Banks 
relatively reliant on wholesale funding have bid up for funds. But doing so has been taken as 
an  adverse  signal,  prompting  further  rationing  of  wholesale  money  market  lending  at  term 
maturities and potentially deterring the strong from entering the market; this is what is known 
as  a  “Lemons”  problem13.  In  the  United  Kingdom,  since  August,  mortgage  approvals  and 
secured lending have declined by more at the medium-sized mortgage banks and specialist 
lenders than at the largest UK banks, partly due to Northern Rock (Charts 14-15). This was 
symmetric. Their mortgage portfolios grew faster over the previous years. All told, this looks 
like a manifestation of the Kashyap and Stein finding, in various non-UK settings, that lending 
is more cyclically variable at banks that start off with weaker balance sheets;14 or, as I would 
prefer to put it, with concentrated income streams and/or funding sources. 
Won’t  the  macroeconomic  effect  of  this  be  dampened  by  the  bigger  and  more  diversified 
banks picking up the slack? It is important to distinguish the longer term from the near term. 
The  longer-term  impact  will  depend  on  whether  the  structure  of  the  industry  shifts.  The 
securitisation boom seems to have altered the terms of trade in UK banking for a while. By 
reducing reliance on retail deposits, it reduced barriers to entry. Lenders’ margins fell (Chart 
16),  and  credit  conditions  in  the  UK  mortgage  market  eased.  Conversely,  the  painful 
reminder  that  undiversified  funding  and  income  sources  may  leave  a  bank  unusually 
vulnerable  will  probably  bring  about  another  shock  to  the  structure  of  the  market.  The 
persistent  tightening  in  mortgage  credit  that  that  would  bring  was  a  factor  in  the  MPC’s 
November projections.  
In the near term, the extent to which the big or more diversified banks fill the gap will depend 
on  the  extent  to  which  they  too  preserve  capital  and  liquidity  in  the  face  of  the  harsh 
environment I have described.  
Money, or bank intermediation  
So  far  I  have  focused  entirely  on  credit.  Where  does  this  leave  money  (or  Money),  the 
starting point for much traditional monetary analysis? 
Well, much that I have said about banks – their capacity, in the short run, to lever up their 
balance  sheets  and  expand  credit  at  will;  their  role  in  providing  liquidity  insurance  to 
investment vehicles and corporates – turns precisely on their liabilities being money. And for 
this reason, banks are after all decisively different from other intermediaries.  
As  transactions  balances  and  so  the  means  of  exchange  in  our  payments  system,  the 
moneyness  of  bank  deposits  lies  at  the  core  of  credit  intermediation.  Subject  only  but 
crucially  to  confidence  in  their  soundness,  banks  extend  credit  by  simply  increasing  the 
borrowing  customer’s  current  account,  which  can  be  paid  away  to  wherever  the  borrower 
wants  by  the  bank  “writing  a  cheque  on  itself”.  That  is,  banks  extend  credit  by  creating 
money. This “money creation” process is constrained: by their need to manage the liquidity 
risk  –  from  the  withdrawal  of  deposits  and  the  draw-down  of  back-up  lines  –  to  which  it

Journal  of  Economics,  Vol.  84,  No.  3,  pp.  488-500.  A  market  for  “lemons”  issue  arises  when  informational 
deficiencies give rise to uncertainty about the true quality of a product. In such circumstances, buyers choose 
to pay only average prices for goods that carry the risk of sellers overstating their true quality. As a result, 
sellers of good products, having little incentive to participate in such markets, are driven out by those sellers of 
poor quality products. The most common example of the problem is the market for used new cars. Rationing 
in the interbank markets is discussed by Freixas, X. and J. Jorge (2007) in “The role of interbank markets in 
monetary policy: a model with rationing”, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Economics Working Papers.

exposes them.15 Adequate capital and liquidity, including for stressed circumstances, are the 
essential ingredients for maintaining confidence.16  
If  that  excursion  into  the  realm  of  financial  stability  appears  to  have  drifted  away  from  the 
immediate issue of Money, it is because the health of bank balance sheets is relevant to both 
the demand for money and its supply, even if this is apparent only occasionally. 
Charles Goodhart has already, and very usefully, stressed the importance of recovering the 
notion  of  shocks  to  the  supply  of  broad  money.17  In  the  main,  however,  in  terms  of  the 
underlying  drivers,  we  are  talking  here  of  shifts  in  the  supply  of  broad  money  caused  by 
shocks to the supply of bank lending: banks create money by extending credit (Diagram C). 
And  as  discussed  earlier,  key  drivers  in  terms  of  bank  balance  sheet  growth  include  the 
variables  that  underpin  bankers’  confidence  in  borrowers;  and,  conversely,  confidence  in 
banks themselves. It should come as no surprise that the “credit channel” macroeconomic 
literature  converged  with  bankers  in  focusing  on  the  tangible  collateral  available  from 
borrowers,  and  on  their  own  capital  and  liquidity  (which  includes  the  ex  ante  and  ex  post 
terms on which they have access to central bank reserves).  
Some important things can be said about this account of shifts in the supply of broad money. 
First, in contrast to the textbook account of shocks to the Money supply via the proverbial 
helicopter drop of base money (pound notes), firms and households are not caught in a bind 
where, in aggregate, they are forced to hold the increased supply of broad money, even if it 
exceeds  demand.  Following  a  shock  to  the  supply  of  credit,  in  which  some  people  or 
companies become less credit constrained, it will be open to others to reduce their existing 
borrowing  as  the  extra  money  circulates  around  the  economy  via  the  purchase  of  goods, 
services and financial assets.  
Second, and more important, the shocks to credit supply are, in themselves, real not nominal 
shocks. And like other real shocks, causing changes in the balance of Aggregate Demand 
and Aggregate Supply, there is a nominal effect only if monetary policy does not respond via 
alterations to the path of short-term interest rates to keep the economy on a stable path and 
in line with the inflation target.  
Absent an appropriate policy response, the easing in monetary conditions would in time feed 
into inflation through an expansion of nominal spending. In the first instance, the expansion 
of “liquidity” represented by faster money growth may sometimes work through asset prices. 
That  is  because  with  imperfect  substitution  between  different  kinds  of  financial  assets, 
relative risk premia may be altered, which in turn may affect borrowing conditions in capital 
markets.18
With an appropriate policy response, what should we expect to see in bank balance sheets, 
in broad money growth, following a credit-supply shock? It might be that the path for broad

18   There is an echo here of a channel stressed by Brunner & Melter, but with the impulse coming from the central 
bank’s short-term interest rate rather than the quantity of reserves, and the transmission into risk premia and 
so other asset prices coming via the expected path of the policy rate and broad money rather than via narrow 
money.

money should be unaltered in the medium term. In other words, a persistent acceleration (or 
deceleration) of M4 would be indicative of a nominal shock, jeopardising achievement of the 
inflation target. The world is not so simple, however. The underlying drivers of the change in 
the  supply  of  bank  lending,  and  so  in  broad  money,  may  also  bring  about  shifts  in  the 
demand  for  money,  validating  a  different  level  for  real  money  balances  –  perhaps  most 
obviously, if investment and so the economy’s productive capacity were affected. 
For  some  underlying  shocks,  it  is  probably  better  to  think  about  the  effects  on  banking 
intermediation rather than simply on bank lending. Faced with a change in their costs and 
opportunities, bankers might sometimes be able to adjust the terms on either their assets or 
their liabilities (or both). Currently, banks have incurred an adverse shock to their wholesale 
funding  (Chart  17).  The  evidence  so  far  suggests  that,  as  well  as  tightening  terms  for 
borrowers, they are improving rates offered on retail deposits.  
Where  does  that  leave  us  on  Money?  It  is  clear  enough  from  the  long-run  relationship 
between money growth and inflation that prolonged shifts in money growth can be an amber 
light  (Chart  18).  And  possible  liquidity  effects  mean  that,  through  risk  premia,  shifts  in  the 
quantity  of  money  may  feed  back  into  financial  asset  markets  and  so  into  broader  credit 
conditions.  But  there  are  no  “easy  wins”  when  it  comes  to  analysing  Money  demand  and 
supply.19  
Money and credit in the current conjuncture  
Those  challenges  are  certainly  apparent  right  now.  Judging  from  a  combination  of  market 
intelligence, surveys and prices, there is no doubt that credit conditions for both households 
and firms have tightened materially. The Bank’s new Credit Conditions Survey, published for 
the first time in September, recorded a clear tightening in availability of credit to corporates 
over  the  previous  quarter.  A  month  later,  a  mini-survey  unsurprisingly  revealed  tighter 
conditions  for  households  too.20  Spreads  on  corporate  and  household  credit  are  already 
higher across the board; and for risky borrowers, financing costs have risen notwithstanding 
the fall in risk-free yields.  
Since  August,  the  MPC  has  stressed,  however,  that  it  will  not  be  sufficient  in  these 
circumstances  to  look  solely  at  the  price  of  credit,  as  there  could  be  increased  quantity 
rationing.  The  standard  view  is  that  households  and  small  firms  are  more  likely  to  be 
adversely  affected  in  such  circumstances  than  large  firms,  which  typically  have  greater 
access to capital markets. But as this disturbance affected the wholesale loan markets, we 
will need to monitor conditions for corporate bond and loan issuance. Indeed, we will need to 
look at total credit, and carefully across different sectors to track the impact of the tightening. 
But  timely  and  rich  data  are  available  on  just  bank  lending.  And  interpreting  them  is  not 
straightforward given the nature of the shock to the system. If reintermediation is significant, 
banks will be taking back on to their balance sheets conduit and investment vehicle paper or 
just holding onto loans for longer than usual before they can be sold onto the capital markets. 
                                                 
19   Perhaps nothing illustrates this as cleanly as the advent of credit derivatives. Derivatives of any kind unbundle 
funding (and so liquidity risk) from the underlying risk to which an agent is seeking exposure via a particular 
contract. So a credit derivative unbundles credit risk from funding. This further complicates interpretation of the 
bank  lending  data  (M4L).  Imagine  that,  due  to  their  customer  networks  and  screening  capability,  banks 
originate all credit, but that they use credit-default swaps to shed a great portion of the credit risk via CDS to 
non-bank  financial  institutions.  In  the  limit,  this  would  be  a  world  in  which  M4L  correctly  measured  (bank) 
lending and M4 was one useful measure of “liquidity”. But it would also be a world in which shocks to credit 
conditions  from  capital  and  risk  appetite  worked  largely  through  non-bank  lenders,  and  in  which  shocks  to 
liquidity  worked  largely  through  depositor  confidence  in  the  banking  system.  In  the  real  world,  this  story 
underlines the need to look at total credit, and to analyse the monetary data with finesse.

 BIS Review 149/2007
It cannot be ruled out that, for a while, the M4L growth rate may deceive as to the underlying 
pace of credit expansion in the economy.  
That is important because, in a nutshell, the turmoil in financial markets is not just a “City” 
event. How potent it will be macroeconomically will depend on how long current conditions 
persist, and the feedback loop between the financial economy and the real economy. 
As to its persistence, necessary conditions for an alleviation of the current strains in credit 
markets are probably at least twofold. First, that the US housing and household debt markets 
stabilise.  Second,  that  banks  and  other  financial  intermediaries  recognise  impairments  to 
asset values, so that uncertainties about counterparty credit risks begin to reduce.  
On  the  financial-real  economy  interaction,  we  must  try  to  avoid  a  vicious  circle  in  which 
tighter  liquidity  conditions,  lower  asset  values,  impaired  capital  resources,  reduced  credit 
supply,  and  slower  aggregate  demand  feed  back  on  each  other.  A  variety  of  policy 
responses  are  possible.  The  announcement  yesterday  by  central  banks  of  co-ordinated 
action via term auctions to alleviate pressure in financing markets is directed at that. Second, 
regulatory authorities around the world are monitoring banks’ liquidity and capital positions, 
including in the context of Basel II. And, thirdly, monetary policy also can in principle play a 
role,  through  what  is  effectively  a  “financial  accelerator”  working  through  bank  balance 
sheets, where that is consistent with maintaining stable inflation in the medium term. 
In the UK, the starting point has been robust domestic demand; the leveraged-buyout sector 
aside,  generally  healthy  corporate  balance  sheets;  somewhat  more  vulnerable  household 
balance sheets;21 and potentially stretched commercial and residential property prices.  
At the Committee’s November meeting, I explored the case for an “insurance cut” addressed 
to  the  downside  risks  from  tightening  credit  conditions.  The  case  for  such  a  cut  was 
strengthened  by  Bank  Rate,  at  5¾%,  standing  at  a  level  that  was  most  probably  mildly 
restrictive. But that had to be weighed against the upward pressures on inflation stemming 
largely  from  the  rise  in  energy  and  other  commodity  prices.  Our  November  projections 
seemed to me likely to validate the expectation already embodied in the money market curve 
that  Bank  Rate  would  over  time  be  lowered,  representing  some  offset  to  the  tightening  in 
liquidity and credit premia. That being so, on balance, I concluded that an immediate cut was 
not  necessary;  and  that  “no  change”  would  give  the  Committee  a  valuable  opportunity  to 
explain  in  the  Inflation  Report  the  implications  of  both  the  credit  and  commodity  shocks, 
underlining that the Committee remains focused on anchoring inflation expectations and so 
achieving the inflation target over the medium term. 
Looking  ahead,  I  noted  the  importance  of  distinguishing  between,  on  the  one  hand,  the 
passing  through  into  the  macroeconomy  of  the  shocks  that  had  already  occurred  to  credit 
conditions and to commodity prices; and, on the other hand, the possibility of new shocks on 
either or both fronts.  
That was my starting point for our December meeting, the minutes of which will be published 
next week.  
Summary and conclusions  
Let me try to pull together some of my central themes. 
                                                 
21   “…households have increased their debt….more debt unavoidably leaves them more vulnerable to bad luck, 
eg adverse economic shocks”, Tucker, P. M. W. (2003), “Credit conditions and monetary policy”, speech at 
the Leeds Financial Services Initiative, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Autumn 2003, p. 373.

I have stressed that we should take care to avoid talking about money when we mean credit. 
In a similar spirit, we should be clear when we mean total credit and when bank lending, but 
without assuming the two are divorced. 
I  have  also  stressed  the  need  for  attention  to  the  underlying  drivers  of  credit  conditions 
throughout the economic cycle. In today’s financial system, we may well need richer data on 
credit quantities and flows outside the banking sector, perhaps along the lines of the US Flow 
of  Funds  statistics.  The  Bank’s  new  Credit  Conditions  Survey  is  also  designed  to  give  us 
better qualitative information to put alongside the quantity and price data. Even so, as with 
asset prices more generally, we will sometimes find it hard to distinguish between changes in 
credit  conditions  warranted  by  fundamentals  and  those  that  are  not.  Failure  to  recognise 
fundamentally  warranted  and  sustainable  shifts  would  deplete  welfare.  But  it  is  distinctly 
uncomfortable  for  the  world’s  central  banks  to  rely  entirely  on  mopping  up  after  a  bubble 
bursts: one imbalance can lead to another.22 The central banking community does not yet 
have a satisfactory way through this dilemma.  
And Money? It occupies one end of the liquidity spectrum, and so changes in the quantity of 
money might potentially affect risk premia, and so credit conditions more generally. Gauging 
that  is  a  formidable  challenge.  As  an  input  to  policy,  there  is  just  no  alternative  to  getting 
one’s hands dirty in analysing the monetary data. With an institutional rather than functional 
definition of broad money, special care is needed not to be misled by shifts in the demand for 
money from the plethora of non-bank financial institutions. This is important if we are to use 
money  as  an  indicator  of  nominal  trends  alongside  survey  and  financial-market-based 
measures of inflation expectations.  
That  brings  me  back  to  where  I  began:  with  our  policy  reaction  function.  Occasionally  the 
markets  will  be  surprised  by  our  policy  decisions.  But  we  should  do  all  we  can  to  avoid 
confusion about how we think about the economy and about monetary policy strategy. In the 
spring, my own view of the signals from broad money had not altered materially. So today I 
have  tried  to  explain  how  I  think  about  money,  credit  and  the  connections  between  them. 
That  has  provided  a  framework  for  some  observations  on  the  current  conjuncture, 
underlining the need for careful attention to conditions in the banking system. Central banks 
should  be,  and  need  to  be,  well  placed  to  undertake  that  analysis,  which  has  rarely  been 
more important than now.  
                                                 
22   I argued this in Tucker, P. M. W. (2006), “Reflections on operating inflation targeting”, speech at the Chicago 
Graduate School of Business, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Summer 2006, p. 220.
