Thomas Jordan: Monetary policy and uncertainty 
Summary of a speech by Mr Thomas Jordan, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss 
National Bank, at the University Freiburg im Breisgau, Freiburg, Germany, 15 January 2008. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The  economy  is  a  complex  system.  Moreover,  it  is  constantly  changing  as  a  result  of 
technological advances and globalisation. Consequently, monetary policy operates in a very 
uncertain  environment.  The  unforeseen  and  radical  developments  in  the  international 
financial markets emanating from the current crisis in the US housing and mortgage market 
have – once again – brought home the major role of uncertainty in monetary policy.  
We are uncertain about the exact way in which the economy functions, the current state of 
the economy and about future exogenous shocks. This uncertainty can express itself in the 
form  of  risk,  with  a  known  probability  distribution.  Alternatively,  it  may  take  the  form  of 
Knightian uncertainty, in which the probability distribution is unknown. It is the latter form of 
uncertainty which presents monetary policy with the greater challenges.  
Uncertainty is a reason why changes to the monetary policy instrument are generally applied 
only  gradually  and  in  small  steps.  However,  if  the  economy  is  thought  to  be  facing  major 
threats, uncertainty may demand rapid and decisive action. 
Monetary  policy  decision-makers  must  be  aware  of  uncertainty  and  the  limitations  of  their 
knowledge.  The  high  degree  of  uncertainty  militates  against  ambitious  fine-tuning  of  the 
economy  but  favours  focusing  on  the  main  task  of  monetary  policy,  which  is  maintaining 
price stability. Moreover, uncertainty necessitates broad-based and impartial analysis as well 
as judgment and flexibility in monetary policy decision-making.
