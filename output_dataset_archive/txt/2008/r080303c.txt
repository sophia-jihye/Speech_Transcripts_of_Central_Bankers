Stefan Ingves: Introduction on monetary policy 
Speech  by  Mr  Stefan  Ingves,  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  the  Riksdag's 
Committee on Finance, Stockholm, 26 February 2008. 
 I would like to begin in roughly the same way as I did when I was last here – by saying a few 
words about the objective and basic purpose of monetary policy. It is in the light of this that 
we  make  our  interest  rate  decisions.  And  our  actions  should  be  assessed  against  this 
background. Our most recent economic assessment and the material for assessing monetary 
policy are also what we are here to discuss today.  
We must always bear in mind that the basis for monetary policy is the price stability objective 
which the Swedish people, through the Riksdag, have delegated to the Riksbank. And this is 
actually  not  merely  an  objective,  it  is  also  a  means.  By  keeping  inflation  low  and  stable, 
monetary  policy  shall help  to  create  the  best possible  conditions  for good  and  sustainable 
economic development.  
To do this in the best possible manner we must constantly learn from what is happening and 
try  to  become  better  at  what  we  do.  Part  of  this  process  involves,  of  course,  examining, 
assessing  and  discussing  monetary  policy  in  a  constructive  manner.  Here  the  Riksdag 
Committee  on  Finance  plays  an  important  role,  both  in  examining  and  in  developing  the 
examination process.  
The  Committee  has  recently  taken  several  good  initiatives.  The  most  recent  example  was 
ordering  the  more  detailed  material  for  assessing  monetary  policy  which  the  Riksbank 
published about a week ago. I shall return to this assessment later. But first I would like to 
say a few words about current monetary policy. 
Our most recent assessment 
Our  most  recent  interest  rate  decision  was  not  an  easy  one.  There  is  considerable 
uncertainty, for instance, on which direction international economic activity will take. And, as 
you are aware, we also had slightly differing opinions within the Executive Board. However, 
we must nevertheless make a decision and the majority of us reached the assessment that 
the repo rate should be raised to 4.25 per cent. We are forecasting that the repo rate will 
remain  around  this  level  over  the  coming  year.  This  type  of  interest  rate  development  will 
contribute to inflation falling back and being around the 2 per cent target a couple of years 
ahead, at the same time as production and employment develop in a balanced manner. 
Different forces are pulling in different directions 
In our decision we weighed together many different factors. A lot has happened; both events 
that could push up inflation and events that could hold it back.  
On the one side were conditions implying a higher interest rate. Inflation rose rapidly in 2007 
and  we  are  expecting  it  to  remain  high  over  the  coming  year.  Expected  inflation  has  also 
risen and cost pressures are high. Economic activity in Sweden remains good and the labour 
market  is  strong.  Although  GDP  growth  will  slacken  and  employment  will  increase  more 
slowly this year, resource utilisation will nevertheless be higher than normal.  
On the other side there was an increased risk of weaker growth in the world economy. There 
is considerable uncertainty over which direction developments in the US economy will take 
and how this will affect the rest of the world. And the financial markets have continued to be 
marked by unease and turmoil.

When all of these factors were weighed together, the majority of us reached largely the same 
view regarding the repo rate as expressed in our December forecast, that is, that the interest 
rate needed to be raised in order for us to attain the inflation target. However, there is still 
considerable uncertainty regarding economic indicators and inflation prospects. It therefore 
appears particularly important to point out that the interest rate path is a forecast. It is not a 
promise! And the interest rate decisions that are made in the future will of course depend on 
how new information affects the prospects for inflation and economic activity in Sweden. 
Communication in connection with the interest rate decision 
It can hardly have escaped the notice of anyone here that the Riksbank received a good deal 
of  criticism  in  connection  with  this  interest  rate  increase.  What  has  been  criticised  is, 
perhaps, not so much the increase as such, more that the interest rate decision took many 
by surprise. 
There have been comments that the Riksbank has been too silent and not prepared market 
agents and others for a raise. We must, of course, consider this criticism. A natural part of 
monetary policy is to consider whether there are things we could do better. This is the way 
we always try to work.  
There is one aspect of this of which it is important to be aware. This is that we quite simply 
cannot send clear signals as to how the interest rate will be set two to three weeks ahead of 
a  monetary  policy  meeting.  This  would  require  us  to  be  fairly  certain  about  the  majority 
opinion and that it will not change. The decision-making situation is often unclear to the very 
last. And, I would say that this was definitely the case this time.  
Now, I do believe that there is widespread understanding that we cannot in advance state 
how the interest rate will be set. It may be the case that as a result of the recent turmoil there 
has been more of a need than usual that the Riksbank comments on the course of events, 
without anticipating the interest rate decision.  
Assessing monetary policy 
Now let us look back and discuss the material for assessing monetary policy, which came 
about on the initiative of the Committee on Finance. It is for me quite special this time. This is 
the  first  occasion  on  which  the  material  for  assessing  monetary  policy  actually  covers 
decisions that I have been party to. 
I  do  not  intend  to  say  a  great  deal  about  any  conclusions  in  the  material  in  this  brief 
introduction. The point is that it is the Committee on Finance that assesses us. However, I 
would  like  to  raise  several  issues  of  principle  about  assessment  in  general  and  about 
assessing monetary policy in particular. These issues have in various ways left their mark on 
the formulation of the material. 
For several reasons, it is important that we are assessed. As I mentioned earlier, one reason 
is that we become more efficient and develop our work methods. Monetary policy acts with a 
lag and must therefore be based on forecasts. If we are to be as proficient as possible in 
forecasting future developments then we must continuously take heed and incorporate new 
knowledge, both new theories and everything else that is happening in the economy “right 
now”. One might say that it is similar to navigating with a nautical chart that is continuously 
being redrawn a bit. But it is not enough to have the latest shipping forecast and an up-to-
date chart in order to be a skilful skipper. In order to learn just how much the rudder needs to 
be adjusted in rough seas, one has to learn from experience. Hopefully, one becomes more 
skilful at maintaining one’s course each time one has to parry. And, for monetary policy to be 
as efficient as possible, we must, in the same way, learn from past events.  
Another  reason  concerns  our  role  as  an  independent  authority.  It  presupposes  that  the 
general public has ample opportunity to insight into our activities and that we are regularly 
2 
 BIS Review 22/2008
examined.  So  assessment  is  important  to  us  –  both  from  an  efficiency  perspective  and  a 
democratic perspective. However, for the assessment to meet these purposes, there are a 
couple of factors to be taken into account. 
What can monetary policy achieve? 
To begin with, the demands – the actual base for the assessment – should be founded on 
what monetary policy can actually achieve. Monetary policy is able to secure an inflation rate 
that  is  in  line  with  the  inflation  target  over  a  number  of  years.  It  can  also  contribute  to 
stabilising  cyclical  fluctuations  in  production  and  employment.  However,  monetary  policy 
cannot achieve a permanently higher level of employment or growth in the economy. Both 
previous experience and economic theory have shown this to be the case. And this was one 
of the reasons why it was decided when drawing up the Sveriges Riksbank Act that it would 
be  inappropriate  for  the  Riksbank  to  have  an  explicit  target  regarding,  for  instance,  GDP 
growth or employment, in addition to the price stability objective. 
It would then appear natural to assess monetary policy by looking at the way in which the 
inflation outcome relates to the Riksbank’s inflation target. But there are some factors here 
too that should be borne in mind.  
In retrospect 
One such factor is that efficient inflation targeting by necessity must be based on forecasts of 
economic development. When a central bank changes its policy rate it takes time before, for 
instance,  inflation,  production  and  employment  react.  Assessing  monetary  policy  in 
retrospect  is,  therefore,  not  as  simple  as  it  may  seem.  It  is  not  enough  to  merely  make  a 
direct comparison of outcome and forecast, or inflation outcome and target. The inflation and 
production that are observed will have been affected by various events, which in many cases 
could not be predicted when the forecast was made. It is important, therefore, to consider 
what  information  was  available  at  the  time  the  decisions  were  made  when  one  discusses 
whether the analysis and interest rate decisions were reasonable. A large forecasting error 
can imply that the forecast was poor. But, it can also be due to a shock, which could not have 
been predicted, having a major effect on the economy. 
What then, are reasonable demands to make of our forecasts? One reasonable demand is 
that they do not on average have poorer accuracy than forecasts made by other economic 
analysts.  Should  our  forecasts  be  ”systematically”  inferior,  it  would  evidently  have  been 
possible  for  us  to  make  better  assessments  on  the  whole.  This  could  also  mean  that  our 
monetary policy decisions probably were not as good as they could have been.  
A long period of examination is necessary to be able to say anything more definite about the 
accuracy of the forecasts. The economy is constantly exposed to random shocks that lead to 
forecasts being incorrect. However, over a long period of time these errors offset one another 
and  on  average  good  forecasts  should  therefore  not  over-estimate  or  under-estimate  the 
actual events. For shorter periods it may be interesting to study individual forecasting errors 
in  greater  detail  to  try  to  analyse  their  causes.  But  even  if  such  an  analysis  is  valuable  it 
cannot be used to draw general conclusions about the forecasting performance.  
While  accuracy  is  very  important,  even  more  is  required  for  a  forecast  to  be  good  in  a 
monetary policy context. A good forecast for inflation, for instance, should correspond with 
the  forecasts  for  other  variables.  And  the  driving  forces  behind  the  forecasts  should  be 
explained in a comprehensible manner. Why does the forecast look the way it does? What 
are  the  mechanisms  acting  as  a  motor  for  this  development?  These  qualities  are  also 
required for a forecast to function as part of the decision-making base for practical monetary 
policy.

Consideration to the real economy 
Another factor to take into account in an assessment of monetary policy is that there may 
sometimes be reason to deliberately deviate from the inflation target. Normally we focus our 
policy  on  attaining  the  inflation  target  within  two  years.  This  is  partly  due  to  it  taking  time 
before  monetary  policy  has  its  full  effect.  But  it  also  has  to  do  with  the  Riksbank  thereby 
being  able  to  contribute  to  a  more  stable  development  in  production  and  employment. 
However, it does assume that the inflation target is not threatened. 
To be able to assess monetary policy during a certain year, it is important to remember that 
such  considerations  also  lie  behind  the  decisions.  In  order  to  gain  a  picture  of  the  initial 
situation for a certain year, it is necessary to study the course of inflation in earlier years. The 
fact that inflation has been allowed to deviate from the target may be due to poor monetary 
policy decisions. But it may also have been part of a deliberate strategy by the Riksbank to 
be able to balance production and employment. If we do take such considerations, we shall 
however have clearly explained this in connection with our decisions. 
So how did it turn out? 
After  this  general  discussion,  allow  me  to  conclude  with  a  very  brief  description  of  the 
considerations that monetary policy faced during the assessment period. The development 
we  envisaged  in  2005  and  2006  was  that  economic  activity  would  continue  to  strengthen. 
Cost  pressures  and  resource  utilisation  were  expected  to  rise  gradually,  but  a  strong 
development of productivity was nonetheless assumed to hold back inflationary pressures. 
The  most  important  consideration was  the  rate  at  which  the  repo  rate  should  be  raised.  It 
was a question of the low inflation rate initially rising towards the target, but in a way that did 
not involve a risk of an overly rapid increase in the rate of inflation later on.  
At the beginning of 2006 we began a phase with increases, which continued in 2007. The 
policy was expected to contribute to inflation being below the target during a relatively long 
period, to then be around 2 per cent, measured in terms of the CPI, during 2007. Underlying 
inflation, the CPIX, was expected to be around 1.5 per cent. The inflation outcome was close 
to these forecasts – at 2.2 and 1.2 per cent respectively. As I just observed, one cannot rely 
too heavily on individual forecasts. But I cannot deny that it, psychologically at least, feels far 
more satisfying than if we had been further away.  
But, naturally, the actual assessment of how well we have managed is the responsibility of 
the  Committee  on  Finance.  And  the  Committee’s  initiative  to  the  independent  material  for 
assessment that we have now published will hopefully make it easier to examine our work. I 
hope it will contribute to a good discussion on monetary policy.  
Thank you!
