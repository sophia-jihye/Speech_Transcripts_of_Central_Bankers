 Fundamentally,  globalisation  is  not  a  new  phenomenon,  and  yet  the  world  has  changed 
dramatically in the past twenty years. This is also evident in financial markets, where, since 
August  2007,  a  local  event  like  the  correction  in  the  US  residential  property  market  has 
rapidly developed into a global event. We are now experiencing the first truly major crisis of 
financial globalisation.  
The longer the crisis lasts, the harder it will be – but also the more important – to keep in 
mind the advantages of financial globalisation and preserve them in the long run. There is a 
need for regulatory correction, and such a need will remain in the future. The existing system 
of  regulation  and  supervision  should  be  further  improved.  The  regulation  of  liquidity  and 
equity,  in  particular,  needs  to  be  fine-tuned,  strengthened  and  adjusted  to  the  latest 
developments in financial markets. However, it is possible that more will be needed than just 
the fine-tuning of regulations. The buffers in the financial system have to be strengthened. In 
simple terms, what is ultimately required is that international banks strengthen their capital 
backing. At the same time, bigger liquidity cushions are needed. In addition, the authorities 
should  look  into  the  possibility  of  supplementing  the  complex  regulations  with  simpler  and 
more robust indicators such as, for instance, more effective concentration limits and an upper 
limit for the indebtedness ratio.
