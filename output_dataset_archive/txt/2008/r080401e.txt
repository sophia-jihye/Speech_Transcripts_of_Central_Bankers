Rakesh Mohan: Innovation and growth – role of the financial sector 
Text  of  the  Bharti  Annual  Lecture  by  Dr  Rakesh  Mohan,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Reserve 
Bank  of  India,  at  a  function  organised  by  Entrepreneurship  Development  Institute of  India, 
Ahmedabad, 28 March 2008.

 “Accelerating  productivity  growth  entails  a  matching  acceleration  in  the 
potential output of goods and services and a corresponding rise in the real 
incomes  available  to  purchase  the  new  output.  The  problem  is  that  the 
pickup in productivity tends to create even greater increases in aggregate 
demand than potential aggregate supply” – Alan Greenspan 
“Whatever  the  supply  side  may  have  in  store,  delivering  low  and  stable 
inflation – and being expected to do so – is how monetary policy can give 
sustainable growth its best chance” – John Vickers 
I  am  deeply  honoured  to  be  invited  to  deliver  the  Bharti  Annual  Lecture  at  the 
Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India. I thought that since I am speaking at this 
cradle of entrepreneurship it would be most appropriate for me to speak on "Innovation and 
Growth". Being in the central bank of the country, however, I should perhaps also focus on 
the role of the financial sector in fostering such innovation and growth. But you may still ask, 
what  can  a  central  banker  say  about  innovation  and  entrepreneurship,  since  we  are,  by 
profession,  supposed  to  be  staid,  boring  and  non-adventurous:  among  our  key  tasks  is  to 
provide financial stability. 
As it happens, the subject of innovation and growth is very central to the concern of central 
banks. A key concern, in fact, the primary objective, of monetary authorities is to achieve low 
and  stable  inflation.  A  necessary  ingredient  for  achievement  of  low  inflation  is  the 
acceleration of productivity growth in an environment of high economic growth. When growth 
in  productivity  is  high,  a  sustained  increase  in  income,  leading  to  sustained  growth  in 
demand  can  be  managed  with  low  inflation.  So  the  quest  for  increasing  productivity  is  of 
great  interest  to  central  bankers,  and  it  is  entrepreneurship  and  innovation  that  leads  to 
productivity growth. 
If I may add a personal note, I have had a long standing academic interest in the promotion 
of research and development, and hence of productivity. In fact, my first academic papers 
were on the measurement of productivity of research and extension in agriculture. Somewhat 
more  recently,  I  also  worked  on  European  industrial  and  technology  policy  at  the  United 
Nations Institute for New Technologies in Maastricht in the mid 1990s. So I am very pleased 
to get this opportunity today to speak on innovation and growth in India. 
In  view  of  the  sharp  acceleration  in  India's  economic  growth  and  the  keen  interest  in  its 
potential  growth,  in  my  talk  today,  I  will,  first,  provide  a  brief  overview  of  India’s  long-term 
growth performance. I will then attempt to set out the conditions for successful innovations. 
To  assess  the  role  of  innovations  in  the  Indian  economy,  I  will  document  the  estimated 
contributions of productivity gains to real GDP growth. I then focus on the role of financial 
sector reforms in contributing to innovation and growth. Finally, I will conclude by outlining 
the  role  of  monetary  policy  in  sustaining  growth  and  innovations  by  ensuring  price  and 
financial stability.

India's growth experience: an overview 
We are now passing through a period of remarkable change and very interesting times. For 
half  a  century  before  independence  in  1947,  there  was  hardly  any  discernible  economic 
growth in the whole Indian sub-continent. We have come a long way from the growth of 3-3.5 
per cent growth in 1950s, to around 5.5 per cent in 1980s, 5.8 per cent in 1990s, and most 
recently to a sustainable growth path of around 8.5 per cent plus (Table 1). But, what is even 
more  striking  is  the  fact  that  if  we  take  into  account  the  decline  in  the  rate  of  population 
growth from 2.2 per cent for 40 years during 1960-90 to 1.8 per cent in the 1990s and further 
down to 1.6 per cent currently, the growth in per capita GDP has seen a tremendous push 
from around 1.6 per cent a year in the 1950s to around 7 per cent per year now.

With such a high rate of economic growth that  we have now experienced in recent years, 
progress in the country is now very palpable. The growth is manifesting itself in many ways 
all across the country: innovation and entrepreneurship are in the air. Exciting changes are 
taking  place  in  all  spheres.  Even  in  agriculture,  which  otherwise  has  exhibited  low  growth 
over the past decade, a great deal of innovation is taking place. You only need to look at the 
documentation done by the National Innovation Foundation, anchored at your neighbouring 
institution the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad. Changes in public policy over 
the past couple of decades have indeed freed the entrepreneurial spirit of India. Our job as 
macroeconomic managers is to provide the overall environment for such entrepreneurship, 
innovation and growth to flourish. 
What  constitutes  such  an  environment?  Low  and  stable  inflation  is  essential:  high  and 
uneven inflation enhances risk and is hence inimical to innovation and risk taking. Investment 
cannot take place without the availability of risk capital, buttressed by the availability of an 
adequate  flow  of  credit  to  nurture  the  investment  climate.  Furthermore,  the  cost  of  money 
available must reflect appropriately the risk and opportunity cost of lending. Underpricing of 
risk can lead to excessive risk taking, and overpricing would lead to the converse. For people 
to take risk, to innovate and grow, to have confidence in the future, the environment of low 
and  stable  inflation  has  to  be  supported  by  the  maintenance  of  overall  financial  stability. 
Finally, it is the existence of sound financial institutions that is necessary for the appropriate 
supply  of  financial  resources  to  take  place.  It  is  the  job  of  the  central  bank  and  other 
regulatory institutions to ensure the existence of such an overall financial environment. 
The  whole  process  of  economic  reforms,  capital  market  forms,  financial  market  reforms, 
banking  reforms,  and  monetary  policy  reforms  have  all  combined  to  provide  such  an 
environment.  We  need  to  ensure  that  this  kind  of  growth  environment  –  low  and  stable 
inflation and financial stability – is indeed maintained and sustained in the medium to long-
term, so that in India entrepreneurship can flower and flourish further.

 BIS Review 36/2008
Conditions for innovation and growth  
The  foremost  economic  thinker  who  talked  about  innovation  was  Joseph  Schumpeter.  He 
defined  it  to  encompass  any  of  a  number  of  different  features.  The  introduction  of  a  new 
method of production would naturally embody some innovation. Indian industry has clearly 
embraced a host of new methods of production in recent years. Second, the opening of new 
markets also needs innovation in marketing approaches and techniques. The data collected 
in the Market Information Surveys of Households (MISH) by the National Council of Applied 
Economic Research (NCAER) amply demonstrate how new markets have been developed in 
the country, right since late 1980s. Third, the use of new sources of supply of raw materials 
also  involves  innovation.  With  trade  liberalization,  industry  now  has  access  to  all  raw 
materials  and  goods  available  in  the  world,  so  a  great  deal  of  innovation  has  been  taking 
place  in  their  procurement  and  use.  A  fourth  possibility  is  innovation  in  new  forms  of 
industrial  organization.  With  overall  change  taking  place  in  the  economic  environment,  we 
are  also  witnessing  new  forms  of  industrial organization  on  a  regular basis. Thus,  from  all 
these  four  points  of  view,  the  pace  of  innovation  has  been  very  healthy  in  India  since  the 
early 1990s. 
The  National  Knowledge  Commission  (2007)  in  its  recent report  titled "Innovation  in  India" 
has defined innovation in a similar fashion:  
"as a process by which varying degrees of measurable value enhancement 
is planned and achieved, in any commercial activity. This process may be 
breakthrough or incremental, and it may occur systematically in a company 
or sporadically; it may be achieved by: 
- 
- 
- 
introducing new or improved goods or services and/or 
implementing new or improved operational processes and/or 
implementing new or improved organizational/ managerial processes 
in order to improve market share, competitiveness and quality, while reducing costs." 
Besides Schumpeter, there are others who have talked  about different types of innovation 
such  as  business  model  innovation,  marketing  innovation,  improvement  in  product  design 
and in product pricing. Here again, we can observe a bucket-full of innovation in the country. 
In  terms  of  organizational  innovation,  Indian  business  organizations  have  ventured  into  all 
kinds  of  new  kinds  of  business  models  –  be  it  the  introduction  of  flat  organizations,  lean 
organizations,  or  pyramidal  organizations  –  and  things  keep  on  changing  according  to  the 
changing  business  environment.  New  business  practices  are  also  being  introduced:  for 
example,  the  practice  of  360  degree  evaluation  within  companies  is  a  new  concept  and 
perhaps alien to a hierarchical society. Another type of innovation is process innovation. The 
Indian pharmaceutical industry is known for its great degree of process innovation in drugs. 
Yet another area is product and service innovation in terms of new goods and services for 
which Indian examples can be many. As regards supply chain innovation, the best example 
comes from the rural sector particularly the agriculture sector, but which is still in its infancy 
in India.  
All these innovations take place when there is some need. The old saying that “necessity is 
the mother of all invention” is clearly true. What has spurred the acceleration of invention in 
India is the overall economic reform process. For example, delicensing of industry in 1991 
ushered  in  a  new  era  of  competition;  which  was  then  reinforced  by  continuing  trade 
liberalization  and  tariff  reform  throughout  the  decade.  Furthermore  the  freeing  of  foreign 
direct investment (FDI) not only provided new competition, but also brought new techniques 
and  technology  into  the  country.  Thus,  Indian  industry  was  forced  to  innovate  in  all  the 
different ways mentioned to cope with the new competition. 
All the innovations in the real sector needed corresponding innovations in the financial sector 
as  well.  Innovations  in  products  and  services  in  the  real  sector  therefore,  move  ideally  in 
BIS Review 36/2008

parallel with innovations in the financial sector. Furthermore, strong public policies and good 
governance structures nurture these two developments and direct them in a non-disruptive 
and  constructive  manner  so  that  the  positive  growth  process  can  be  sustained.  Financial 
innovation  involves  development  of  new  financial  services  and  products.  And  these  new 
products and services need to be more easily accessible. So, financial firms have to innovate 
to  broaden  access  to  their  services.  Greater  financial  inclusion  is  a  must.  The  spread  of 
micro finance is one method by which financial inclusion is being sought to be achieved.  
Innovation  involves  risk.  If  risk  is  to  be  financed  effectively,  it  is  essential  for  financial 
institutions to improve their risk management systems in their entirety. First is the need to 
develop  appropriate  risk  assessment  systems.  Here  the  proposed  introduction  of  credit 
information  bureaus  should  help  greatly  in  the  future.  Second  is  the  development  of  risk 
mitigation systems. Third, appropriate risk allocation mechanisms have to be developed, so 
that  risk  is  adequately  distributed  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  financial  institutions.  As 
financial  systems  become  more  market  oriented  and  as  price  discovery  of  interest  rates 
becomes  more  efficient,  financial  institutions  find  better  and  better  ways  of  managing  and 
allocating risk. Effective development of financial systems to finance innovation takes a good 
deal of time.  
Innovations can either be supply induced or demand led. Supply led innovations arise from 
new research and development activities that give rise to new technologies, new products, 
and  new  processes.  Demand  led  innovation  essentially  arises  from  the  pressures  of  new 
competition. And, of course, R & D itself can be demand induced. 
For innovation to take place on a continuous and efficient basis in response to the pressures 
felt there is a need for an effective national innovation system. Apart from the structuring of in 
house  mechanisms  within  firms,  there  is  need  for  the  existence  of  mutually  supporting 
networks of organizations that nurture the culture of research development and innovation. 
R&D  institutions  have  to  be  supported  by  standard  setting  organizations,  technical 
consultancies and the like so that firms have adequate technical support systems. Clusters 
and  incubators  are  also  needed  for  creating  such  supportive  environments  for  small  and 
medium firms. 
But  innovation  also  comes  embedded  in  both  labour  and  capital.  As  investment  picks  up, 
new machines are installed that have newer technology embedded in them. For the same 
price the new machine does much more than the old one. The revolution in machine tools 
with embedded new information technology over the last 20 years is a case in point. Another 
example  could  be  what  is  happening  to  cell  phone  technology  with  multi-tasks,  at  lower 
prices. A great deal of work can now be accomplished on the cell phone even when people 
are travelling. Thus, a great deal of innovation gets embedded in new capital, and all these 
changes  enhance  efficiency  and  productivity.  Similarly,  on  the  human  capital  side,  newly 
trained manpower comes with newer skills. They do the same jobs much faster than the less 
trained older labour force. As organisations renew their labour force or impart training to their 
existing workers they are likely to increase their pace of innovation and productivity growth. 
All  such  developments  that  promote  innovation  and  productivity  growth  are  of  the  utmost 
interest to central banks.  
While it is interesting to note that productivity appears to have picked up worldwide over the 
last decade or so and new investments could have been the source of its acceleration, the 
implications of such positive shocks for sustained growth need to be understood. The rapid 
replacement of new technology means that the technological progress gets embedded in the 
accumulation  of  fresh  capital  stock  at  a  faster  rate  than  would  otherwise  be  the  case. 
Second, recent research shows that new technology is quite sensitive to movements in the 
cost  of  capital.  A  combination  of  high  price  elasticity  and  the  declining  price  of  high-tech 
equipment  also  contributes  to  an  investment  boom.  Third,  these  investments  have 
considerable externalities or spill over effects. The application of new technology has helped 
to  reduce  operating  expenses  and  as  a  result  of  higher  productivity  there  has  been 
4 
 BIS Review 36/2008
considerable stability in labour costs. Globalisation in terms of outsourcing combined with the 
availability  of  new  skilled  labour  in  China  and  India  has  also  contributed  to  low  inflation 
worldwide.  Combined  with  the  impact  of  competition  in  exercising  pricing  leverage,  these 
developments  have  helped  significantly  in  containing  inflationary  pressures  during  the 
expansion phase of global GDP over the past decade. 
In this process, the law of supply creating its own demand also operates. First, productivity 
increases result in a higher potential for growth and this in turn generates further demand for 
goods  and  services.  The  real  rate  of  return  on  new  investments  increases  and  capital 
spending accelerates to take advantage of the profit opportunities. Employment and income 
generated help to augment consumer demand as well. The spurt in capital market valuations 
could be a reflection of such higher profitability. The wealth effect of such a capital market 
spurt could further accelerate both consumer and investment demand. 
Higher the growth in productivity, higher is the overall growth at given levels of investment 
and  that  also  means  that  much  higher  growth  can  be  sustained  by  higher  investments 
without  arousing  inflationary  pressures.  The  best  thing  thus  one  can  do  is  to  encourage 
innovation, productivity and growth which can then bring about better control over inflation. 
This is exactly what has happened in the world in the last 10 years. Central banks around the 
world congratulate themselves for having been very successful especially in the last 10 to 15 
years  for  having  tamed  inflation  internationally.  But,  what  lies  behind  that  achievement 
through monetary policy is also the gains that have come through increases in productivity. 
The productivity boom in the US has contributed immensely to non-inflationary growth in the 
US and also globally in the last decade. What is important from the central bankers’ point of 
view  is  that  this  inflation  moderation  has  taken  place  in  the  presence  of  considerable 
monetary  accommodation  over  the  same  period.  In  the  US,  most  of  the  1995-2000 
productivity  growth  acceleration  can  be  attributed  to  investments  in  technology  and 
management know-how needed to exploit it (Oliner, Sichel and Stiroh).  
Thus, encouraging innovative activity through investments in R&D activity is something that 
is central to the concern of central banks. Innovation and productivity growth contribute to the 
attainment  of  low  and  stable  inflation,  and  low  and  stable  inflation,  in  turn,  provides  an 
appropriate environment for innovation. 
Whereas innovation is characteristically done within firms or in R&D organisation, for such 
activity to flourish, it is essential that there is both macroeconomic and financial stability. 
In  sum,  we  need  a  conducive  macroeconomic  environment  for  innovation  and  growth,  a 
supportive  financial  system  and  an  innovation  nurturing  environment  through  national 
innovation systems. 
There  are  now  some  signs  that  inflation  could  be  again  increasing  worldwide.  Commodity 
prices,  particularly  of  food  and  oil,  have  been  increasing  in  particular.  Similarly  there  are 
indications  that  global  growth  could  be  slowing  down  at  the  same  time,  particularly  in  the 
United States. Is this happening because innovation and productivity growth is slowing down 
in the US? Similar tendencies are evident in the UK. So, the outlook for productivity growth is 
crucial in the global context and of great concern to central bankers. 
India’s growth experience: trends in innovation and productivity 
I have earlier sketched India's broad growth path since independence. When growth was low 
in the 1950s, 1960s, and particularly in the 1970s, there was little innovation. Now that the 
growth is much higher there is also the appearance of much more innovation all round. What 
is  the  evidence  that  this  is  actually  happening?  Unlike  the  upsurge  in  growth  in  the  mid 
1990s,  the  growth  this  time  around  has  been  much  more  broad-based,  driven  by  robust 
contributions from both manufacturing and services. And, most importantly, unlike in the past 
an  important  ingredient  of  this  growth  momentum  has  been  improvements  in  factor 
productivity.  
BIS Review 36/2008

Whereas it is difficult to obtain a comprehensive picture of the spread of innovation in the 
country,  occasional  surveys  provide  good  evidence  on  the  increasing  importance  that  is 
being placed by firms on innovation. There are also some macro estimates available on the 
extent of productivity growth and efficiency in capital use in the Indian economy. I present 
these in turn. 
The  National  Knowledge  Commission  carried  out  a  survey  of  a  wide  variety  of  firms  to 
understand the nature of innovations, the differences between firms across sectors, and the 
role played by innovations in driving growth in India. The survey covered a total of 137 firms 
– 58 large firms and 79 small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The survey results suggest 
that innovation is clearly in the air in the Indian business environment. 
The survey found that innovation gained in importance in the decision making processes of 
firms  –  both  large  and  small.  Firms  find  that  an  increasing  proportion  of  their  growth  in 
revenue,  profitability,  reduction  in  costs  and  increase  in  market  share  can  be  attributed  to 
innovations. Thus investing in innovation is being seen as a necessity for business success. 
Most innovation is incremental, though breakthrough innovations can bring a more dramatic 
jump in sales, profitability and the like. As might be expected, it is large firms that can hope to 
do breakthrough innovations, while small firms typically do incremental innovations. 
Consistent with our earlier classification of what constitutes innovation, the survey finds that 
innovations  are  well  spread  across  new  products,  new  methods  of  production,  marketing, 
innovative  use  of  raw  materials,  and  the  like.  Interestingly,  although  the  intensity  of 
innovation  is  found  to  be  higher  in  manufacturing  firms,  the  pace  of  growth  in  innovation 
intensity  is  higher  in  service  sector  firms.  Service  firms  are,  furthermore,  more  likely  to  be 
"highly innovative". 
As  regards  the  process  of  innovation,  firms  that  consciously  invest  in  R&D,  have  better 
contacts  and  collaboration  with  R&D  institutions,  universities  and  government  laboratories 
have a better chance of making innovation. Thus, there is great potential synergy between 
public investment in knowledge generating institutions and private entrepreneurship. In fact, 
some  of  the  key  barriers  to innovation  are  the shortage  of skills,  dull  educational  curricula 
and inadequate interaction with public agencies. Correspondingly, within firms, the attention 
of top management to the importance of innovation is essential. 
These survey results confirm the a priori view of rising innovation activity and awareness in 
India  and  their  growing  importance  in  driving  competitiveness  and  productivity  gains  in  an 
increasingly  competitive  economic  environment.  At  the  same  time,  as  the  results  indicate, 
there is a need to improve the skills of the workforce. The quality of education imparted in 
several  colleges  and  universities  in  the  country  remains  less  than  adequate  to  meet  the 
emerging  demands  for  skilled  professionals.  Substantial  expansion  and  reforms  in  the 
education sector would be needed on an urgent basis. Education facilities would need to be 
extended at all levels, viz., primary, secondary and at a tertiary level.  
Macro evidence 
The survey-based evidence of growing recognition of innovation as well as its importance in 
production, presented above, is also supported by macro evidence in terms of economy-wide 
growth decomposition exercises. There is evidence that the step-up in Indian growth in the 
post-1993 period has been led by improvements in factor productivity. Bosworth and Collins 
(2007) who study the period 1978-2004 find a pick-up in productivity growth in the latter part 
of their sample (Table 2). Annual real GDP growth rose by 2 percentage points between the 
period 1978-1993 and the period 1993-2004; according to estimates by Bosworth and Collins 
(op  cit),  this  pick-up  was  almost  evenly  divided  between  higher  capital  deepening  and 
productivity growth. The sample period covered by Bosworth and Collins (op cit) ends in the 
year 2003-04, whereas the acceleration in real GDP growth has occurred in the subsequent 
years. The same period has also exhibited a surge in domestic savings and investment. With 
6 
 BIS Review 36/2008
the  step  up  in  growth  since  2003-04,  it  will  be  interesting  to  study  the  growth  accounting 
analysis for the period since 2003-04 onwards to find out the comparative contributions of 
capital deepening and productivity to the acceleration in real GDP growth: but for this we will 
now have to wait for a few years.

There  has  been  a  good  deal  of  academic  discussion  on  the  nature  of  growth  in  East  and 
South  East  Asia,  particularly  in  the  aftermath  of  the  financial  crisis  of  1997.  One  view  to 
emerge  was  that  the  high  growth  experienced  by  this  region  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  was 
based on extensive capital investment, and that there was little innovation and productivity 
growth in these countries during that period. This is somewhat different from the more recent 
growth  experiences  of  China  and  India.  Growth  in  both  China  and  India  has  been 
accompanied by significant productivity growth (Table 2). What is notable is that the growth 
in  capital  investment  has  been  very  high  in  China,  in  contrast  to  that  in  India,  while 
employment growth has been comparable. We can also observe that the pace of productivity 
growth  picked  up  significantly  in  India  in  the  1990s,  after  the  advent  of  economic reforms. 
India  has  indeed  been  very  economical  in  use  of  capital  and  therefore  the  growth  in 
productivity has been relatively high in India since the mid-1990s. The record of the rest of 
Asia has not been as good with regard to productivity growth. 
It  is  important  to  speculate  on  the  reasons  for  such  differences  in  performance.  Definitive 
answers are difficult to find and need much more careful research. However, it is probably 
correct to say that the Indian financial sector has been less distorted than China and some of 
the other Asian countries after the financial sector reforms of the early and mid 1990s. The 
cost of capital became market related after the mid 1990s. Indian industry appears to have 
responded  well  to  these  emerging  market  signals.  Debt  equity  ratios  came  down  after  the 
late 1990s when real and nominal interest rates rose. And productivity appears to have risen. 
Capital  seems  to  be  used  with  much  more  care.  So,  financial  sector  reforms  could  have 
played an important role in the increase in innovation and productivity in Indian industry in 
recent years. Indian industry has clearly been working hard over the last decade, which is 
also now evident in the attainment of very high profit growth over the last 5 years or so.  
Despite the favourable features which have helped Indian industry to achieve a consistently 
high  growth  in  the  recent  years,  the  uncertainties  about  productivity  trends  pose  a  major 
challenge in India. Latecomers to industrialisation can achieve considerable local innovation 
and  growth  in  productivity  by  adopting  already  available  technology.  As  the  level  of 
BIS Review 36/2008

technology  improves,  greater  R  &  D  investment  has  to  be  made,  both  to  adapt  available 
technology and to develop the new technology needed for innovation. Once the potential for 
low hanging technology fruit is exhausted new investment has to be made or greater effort to 
pluck the higher hanging fruit. Indian industry therefore has to become more conscious of the 
need  for  continuing  the  rate  of  innovation  achieved.  It  will  need  greater  attention  to 
enhancing the level of human capital through training and higher education, higher rates of 
capital investment, along with more research and development activities. 
Turning to sectoral analysis of productivity growth for the Indian economy, estimates suggest 
that productivity gains were recorded in both industry and in the services sectors in the post-
reform period (Table 3). The gains were relatively modest in industry vis-a-vis the services 
sector, which recorded a significant pick-up in productivity growth, which is consistent with 
the sketchy micro evidence available. According to estimates by Bosworth and Collins (op 
cit), productivity gains accounted for almost 70 per cent of the growth in output per worker of 
the  services  sector  during  the  period  1993-2004;  over  the  same  period,  productivity  gains 
accounted  for  only  a  third  of  the  growth  in  output  per  worker  of  the  industrial  sector.  The 
relatively lower order of contribution of productivity in the industrial sector could perhaps be 
reflective of the slowdown in the sector over the latter part of the sample period.

The significantly higher order of productivity growth in the services sector could be attributed 
to  the  fact  that  the  delivery  of  services  has  changed  tremendously.  The  introduction  of 
information technology has changed the face of service delivery. Financial services are the 
most  obvious  illustration  of  this  revolution.  In  fact,  it  is  difficult  to  imagine  the  delivery  of 
financial services without the use of information technology. Trading in capital markets is now 
totally electronic, which has also helped greatly in expanding the access to capital markets 
across the country. Now access to the capital market is, in principle, equalized regardless of 
the person’s physical location. The introduction of mobile banking has just begun: now that 
there almost 300 million cell phones in the country we can expect a huge transformation in 
the delivery of banking services as this technology takes root. Travel services are another 
area where the use of information technology has changed the form of service delivery. Air, 
train, bus and hotel bookings can be made from the comfort of the home without the use of 
intermediaries.  This  has  also  resulted  in  great  cost  savings,  hence  an  increase  in 
productivity.  The  delivery  of  government  services  is  also  beginning  to  take  advantage  of 
information  technology  in  a  myriad  of  ways,  from  land  titling  to  bill  payments,  information 
dissemination and the like. Thus innovation is pervasive in our daily lives.  
The efficiency in the use of resources in India, in a cross-country context, is also evident from 
the movements in incremental capital output ratios of the overall economy. Analysis clearly 
indicates that not only has there been a consistent upward trend in India’s investment rate 
since the 1950s, there is also evidence that capital has been employed productively. Barring 
the decade of the 1970s, the incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) has hovered around 4. 
There  are  some  signs  of  improvement  in  domestic  productivity  in  the  post-reforms  period, 
consistent with the earlier evidence. Cross-country comparison indicates that ICOR has been 
amongst the lowest in India. This is especially true of the period since the 1980s onwards 
(Table 4). Various reform measures aimed at increasing the competitiveness appear to be 
having the desired impact on the productivity of the Indian economy.

 The evidence thus clearly demonstrates that India has achieved its growth in recent years 
with judicious use of capital accumulation while innovating to achieve significant productivity 
growth. A conducive macroeconomic policy framework, accompanied by greater efficiency in 
financial intermediation, which transmits appropriate signals with regard to the cost of capital, 
has contributed to this pattern of growth. Policy changes have also contributed to the rapid 
growth  in  trade  and  capital  flows,  which  have  enabled  the  diffusion  of  newer  technologies 
and management systems necessary for continuing innovation and productivity growth. This 
provides comfort that the improvements in productivity, can be sustained in the medium term.

 BIS Review 36/2008
Role of financial sector reforms in promoting innovation and growth 
The  key  issue  for  innovation  and  growth  in  financial  sector  development  is  how  well  the 
financial  system  is  able  to  finance  new  ideas,  new  products  and  new  entrepreneurs.  In  a 
repressed financial system, sans adequate risk management systems and limited depth of 
financial markets, banks are typically happy to fund incumbents, and exhibit little interest in 
funding new businesses and new ideas. As financial systems develop, larger corporates can 
go  to  the  market  directly  and  disintermediation  takes  place.  So,  banks  have  fewer 
incumbents to finance and so it can be expected that they would be pushed increasingly into 
financing more and more new projects, new entrepreneurs and new ideas.  
Has  this  happened  in  India?  Financial  sector  reforms  have  covered  almost  all  aspects  of 
banking and the capital market. The decontrol and expansion of capital markets should have 
made  the  access  to  market  intermediated  financial  resources  easier  for  well  established, 
credit rated large incumbents. Reforms in the banking system have been aimed to bring in 
greater efficiency by introducing new competition through the new private sector banks and 
increased operational autonomy to public sector banks. In the government securities market, 
the  reform  measures  have  been  aimed  at  better  price  discovery  of  interest  rates  by 
auctioning  government  securities,  and  developing  the  infrastructure  for  efficient  trading.  In 
the  forex  market  likewise,  there  has  been  a  gradual  movement  towards  a  market-based 
exchange rate regime coupled with the introduction of newer products and players. Side-by 
side,  conscious  steps  have  been  undertaken  towards  building  up  of  the  institutional 
architecture in terms of markets, technological and legal infrastructure. 
Consequent upon the wide array of such measures, the cost of funds for the corporate sector 
has  become  market-related.  Coupled  with  greater  access  to  foreign  investment  alongside 
improvements  through  trade  liberalization,  there  is  a  significant  growth  in  manufacturing 
exports  as  also  the  import  intensity  of  exports.  The  corporate  sector  has  thus  become 
increasingly exposed to international product and factor prices. Such market-driven pricing of 
products and factors combined with gradual reduction in rates of interest in an overall benign 
interest  rate  environment  and  moderate  debt  equity  ratios  have  resulted  in  lower  interest 
outgo.  This,  in  turn,  has  promoted  better  resource  allocation  and  efficient  use  of  new 
technology, which has become reflected in their profit and efficiency parameters.  
What has been the result in terms of corporate performance? All the important parameters: 
sales,  gross  profit,  profit  after  tax,  all  have  recorded  robust  growth  rates  since  2002-03, 
implying that economic activity in the corporate sector has improved tremendously over this 
period (Table 5). The dependence on banks for financing has indeed gone down. There has 
been a very significant reduction of interest expenses in total expenditure. To that extent, the 
corporate sector could have become more insensitive to small movements in interest rates.

The  high  growth  in  profits  of  the  corporate  sector  suggests  that  competition  is  inadequate 
and that entry of new firms or even the threat of entry of new firms is low. Growth in output is 
being  driven  more  by  expansion  of  existing  firms  rather  than  through  the  creation  of  new 
firms. This pattern would suggest that new firms are not finding it easy to access funds from 
the  banking  system  at  reasonable  risk  adjusted  rates.  It  is  essential  that  banks  should  be 
careful in their risk assessment, and that the interest rates charged and volumes of funds lent 
should  reflect  the  risk  assessed.  In  the  presence  of  the  kind  of  high  growth  rates  being 
observed in the economy, are banks being adequately supportive? What is the evidence?  
First,  the  pattern  of  funding  from  banks  is  predominantly  to  the  urban  and  metropolitan 
sectors which account for the overwhelming share of credit. The share of metropolitan areas, 
in fact, has risen further in the current decade, with that of rural and urban areas declining 
(Table 6).

Second,  the  pattern  of  funding  by  the  banks  remains  skewed  towards  larger  firms.  The 
problem for the banks, however, is that profit growth in the corporate sector has been so high 
in recent years, that they do not need much bank borrowing, and the share of debt service in 
corporate balance sheets has been getting lower and lower. In fact, in view of the reduced 
need  of  large  firms  for  bank  funding  there  is  great  competition  among  banks  to  fund  the 
incumbents, to fund the larger firms, leading to lending rates levied on them becoming much 
lower than the declared benchmark prime lending rates (BPLR). This is in some sense an 
encouraging sign, so that if the banks do not have enough income generation from the larger 
firms, they may be willing to lend more to the newer entrepreneurs. The existing preference 
for lending to larger firms is presumably due to the old banking habit of greater comfort with 
incumbents to whom it is safer and easier to lend. Finding new entrepreneurs, new ideas, 
new products, and new services to finance need greater effort and more sophisticated risk 
management systems. Indian banks have also been handicapped by the absence of credit 
information bureaus and any availability of centralized credit records of small and medium 
entrepreneurs. This problem should now get rectified since the Credit Information Companies 
Act has been passed by parliament. Guidelines for these companies have also been issued 
by the Reserve Bank, so we can expect such new companies to get established in the near 
future. 
There  is  some  corroborating  evidence  suggesting  the  difficulty  of  entry  for  new  business 
entrepreneurs. When we look at the World Bank surveys on doing business across countries, 
India typically ranks quite low in the range of 120-130. At the same time, we find that both the 
level of profits of the corporate sector in India and growth of profits is among the highest in 
the world. How can both be true: that doing business in India is more difficult than in other 
countries,  while  at  the  same  time  the  Indian  corporate  sector  has  exhibited  higher  profit 
growth  than  probably  any  other  country  in  the  world  over  the  past  4-5  years?  A  possible 
explanation for this apparent contradiction seems to be the high entry costs: once you get in, 
it is easy to grow, but getting in, in the first place, is difficult. This suggests that the Indian 
financial system is, perhaps, still not adequately geared to finance new ideas and new firms. 
Further, one of the distinguishing features of the high credit growth in recent years has been 
the continuing low share of credit going to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), although 
there has been some change in the trend this past year. Again, it is puzzling how the credit 
growth  to  SMEs  among  all  the  segments  has  actually  been  the  lowest.  What  has  really 
happened  is  that  banks  have  essentially  moved  from  lending  to  the  corporate  sector  to 
individuals and retail, still leaving out the middle, namely SMEs. And again, banks appear to 
have  moved  to  individuals  and  retail  because  of  the  high  quality  of  collateral  available  for 
such loans. For the financial system to nurture innovation and growth, its risk assessment 
practices  need  to  improve  while  transaction  costs  are  reduce.  Greater  availability  of  credit 
histories and credit information should help in this regard. All these will lead to better capacity 
in  the  financial  system  to  take  informed  credit  decisions.  As  we  go  ahead  with  further 
BIS Review 36/2008 
 13
development  of  the  financial  system,  it  should  enable  slicing  of  risk  in  such  a  way  that 
investors  with  different  risk  appetites  from  higher  to  lower,  are  able  to  find  appropriate 
vehicles for investment. The issue is basically one of informed risk management in terms of 
segregating  more  risky  from  less  risky  credits  and  finding  appropriate  ways  of  financing 
them. As we go along with reforms, we need to work harder to develop such institutions and 
systems. Venture capital has also a role to play. 
Strengthening of the domestic financial system is a prerequisite for external sector opening 
up  particularly  in  the  capital  account.  Periodic  assessment  of  financial  sector  gains 
importance in this respect. Such assessment includes appraisals of the relative importance 
of  the  various  financial  institutions  in  the  system;  the  sensitivity  of  the  system  to  shocks 
under  alternative  scenarios  and  financial  soundness  indicators.  They  also  encompass 
assessments of liquidity developments and policies, the crisis-management framework, the 
regulation and supervisory practices. Secondly, assessments of the extent to which financial 
sector standards and codes are observed make it possible to identify gaps in regulation and 
transparency, evaluate the overall stability of the financial system, and measure a country’s 
practices  against 
India  undertook  a  comprehensive  self-
assessment of financial standards and codes some five years ago and this is being reviewed 
on  an  ongoing  basis.  India  was  one  of  the  earliest  to  participate  in  the  financial  sector 
assessment by the IMF and World Bank and recently a Committee has been constituted by 
Government of India in consultation with the Reserve Bank to take up a comprehensive self 
assessment of financial sector. 
international  benchmarks. 
The role of monetary policy 
Coming to the role of monetary policy: what we have achieved over the last decade? And 
how  is  it  relevant  for  fostering  innovation,  entrepreneurship  and  growth?  A  great  deal  of 
market  development  has  taken  place  in  the  financial  sector.  We  now  have  market  related 
flexible interest rates, more open forex markets, and flexible market related exchange rates, 
although the Reserve Bank continues to intervene in the forex market. We also have a active 
capital market for equities, though the corporate bond market has some way to go. We also 
have  more  competition  in  banking.  So  there  has  been  pro-active  monetary  and  financial 
sector policy during last decade or so, which has promoted economic growth, maintained low 
inflation along with financial stability.  
In  India,  monetary  policy  has  the  twin  objectives  of  price  stability  and  growth.  While  the 
Reserve Bank does not target an explicit inflation rate as some countries do, the objective 
currently is to contain the inflation rate within an upper bound of 5 percent and attempt to 
reduce it further in the medium term. The relative emphasis of monetary policy stance varies 
with  the  prevailing  macroeconomic and  monetary  conditions:  for  example,  inflation  was  an 
issue  during  much  of  2007,  and  continues  to  be  of  concern  now.  The  upshot  of  these 
concerns has been reflected in a gradual tightening of policy rates and additional measures 
such as increase in cash reserve ratio since the latter part of 2004. 
The best contribution that monetary policy can make for fostering innovation and growth is to 
provide an environment of low inflation, low inflation expectations, along with confidence in 
the maintenance of financial stability. Entrepreneurs take considerable risk as it is: on top of 
that if we add macro-economic risks in terms of higher inflation, high inflation volatility and 
higher interest rates, then the risk perception can be such that entrepreneurship, innovation 
and  investment  gets  effectively  constrained.  That  will  inevitably  result  in  lower  investment 
rates and hence lower economic growth. Therefore, to keep the momentum of high growth, it 
is extremely important to recognise that the best contribution that monetary policy can make 
is indeed to ensure that inflation and inflation expectations are well anchored.  
There  is  evidence  that  pro-cyclical  behaviour  of  financial  markets  and  pro-cyclical 
macroeconomic  policies  have  not  encouraged  growth;  they  have  in  fact  increased  growth 
and consumption volatility in developing countries that have integrated to a larger extent in

international  financial  markets.  The  menu  of  macroeconomic  policies  for  financial  and  real 
economic stability has thus expanded in recent years to multiple objectives and significant 
trade-offs. Preventive or prudential macroeconomic and financial policies, which aim to avoid 
the excess accumulation of public and private sector debts during periods of upward cycle, 
have become a part of the standard policy prescription.  
Policy choices presently involve a mix of counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policies, which 
also include the practice of an appropriate exchange-rate regime, buttressed by active capital 
account management that reduces the risks that  can arise from turbulence in international 
financial markets. Such measures would also include adequate prudential regulation of the 
financial sector, and particularly of the banking system. Thus, for instance, the increase in 
risk  weights  on  lending  to  certain  sectors  such  as  real  estate  has  been  aimed  at  curbing 
excessive credit growth to sectors that seem in danger of over-extension. 
We need to pursue somewhat counter cyclical monetary and fiscal policies with appropriate 
external sector management, ensuring overall financial stability – price stability, low inflation, 
low  inflation  expectations  and  low  inflation  volatility.  It  is  only  under  these  conditions,  that 
investment,  innovation  and  growth  can  be  maintained  in  a  sustainable  fashion.  We  must 
continue to ensure that the growth momentum is sustained with price stability.  
While India has been maintaining one of the highest growth rates among countries for quite 
some time now, the growth dynamics has dramatically shifted in the last three to four years 
and the economy is poised to break from an intermediate growth rate of around 6 percent to 
a high growth rate regime of well above 8 percent. Despite high levels of internal resource 
generation and access to external borrowings, credit demand across sectors also had picked 
up  quite  substantially  pushing  the  rate  of  investment  to  new  heights.  The  increasing 
consumer and business confidence have been attracting foreign investment flows resulting in 
easy  liquidity  conditions  in  the  financial  system.  The  central  bank  had  to  address  these 
complex set of pressures of increased liquidity, substantial expansion in credit particularly to 
certain sensitive sectors such as real estate and retail and the growing capital inflows and 
consequent need for sterilization. 
A  cross-country  comparison  of  major  EMEs  that  have  adopted  inflation  targeting  (IT) 
indicates that growth in India has been amongst the highest while inflation remains relatively 
low  (Mohan,  2007).  Thus,  the  recent  record  of  macroeconomic  management  in  India  is 
exemplary, even amongst the EMEs that target inflation. The challenge for monetary policy 
now  is  to  reduce  inflation  further  in  the  medium  term  towards  international  levels,  while 
maintaining the momentum of high growth and preserving financial stability. 
Real  GDP  growth  has  averaged  8.7  per  cent  per  annum  during  the  5-year  period  ending 
2007-08. The present domestic investment rate of around 36-37 per cent is expected to help 
sustain the current growth momentum. In Indian economic history, there has never been this 
order of growth for five consecutive years; this has been achieved while keeping inflation low 
and  stable  and  anchoring  inflationary  expectations.  Apart  from  increase  in  productivity, 
benefits through trade liberalization, fiscal consolidation and more effective monetary policy 
have also helped in sustaining relatively a low inflation rate since the mid-1990s. Spikes and 
seasonal  falls  in  headline  inflation  rates  will  continue  to  occur  due  to  relative  price 
adjustments  and  supply  shocks  emanating  from  agricultural  and  other  commodity  prices. 
Such shocks have evidently amplified over the past 2-3 years on account of large increases 
in a range of global commodity prices such as oil, food and metals. In view of the success in 
reducing inflation from the long-run average of 7-8 per cent to 4-5 per cent now, the society's 
tolerance  rate  of  inflation  has  also  come  down.  In  this  crucial  stage  of  transition,  it  is 
important to recognize that price and financial stability are very crucial to sustain the growth 
at current levels without any disruptive forces coming into play.  
Let me conclude. 
The  relevance  of  monetary  policy  for  inducing  innovation  and  growth  is  then  obvious. 
Entrepreneurs, investors and innovators take a great deal of risk while putting their money

behind  their  ideas.  Such  entrepreneurial  and  innovative  behaviour  flourishes  when  other 
risks  are  reduced:  when  inflation  is  low  and  stable,  and  hence  inflation  expectations  are 
anchored; when interest rates are low and stable; when the exchange rate is not volatile; and 
when credit flow is available in adequate quantity. This is what Indian monetary policy has 
aimed to achieve. And the outcomes in terms of growth, investment, entrepreneurial activity 
and innovation in this decade would suggest that we have indeed achieved some success in 
attaining the objectives of monetary policy as transparently expressed.
