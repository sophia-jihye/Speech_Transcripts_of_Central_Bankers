Jean-Pierre Roth: Role of the central banks with respect to the financial 
market crisis 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Roth,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the 
Swiss  National  Bank  and  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Bank  for  International 
Settlements, at the Forum Suisse de Politique internationale, Geneva, 23 May 2008. 
The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The central banks have been working extremely hard to respond appropriately to the turmoil 
that has beset the financial markets in recent months. Aimed at enhancing the resilience of 
the markets and safeguarding the stability of the financial system, the measures they have 
taken have been drastic and innovative at times. 
As this episode has also shown, a policy of preserving financial stability is not always easy to 
reconcile with monetary policy. The central banks must therefore tread carefully and avoid 
compromising  their  price  stability  objectives  when  intervening  to  defend  financial  stability. 
While money market conditions deteriorated over the past nine months, the Swiss National 
Bank  put  off  interest  rate  hikes  so  as  not  to  provoke  a  tightening  of  credit  conditions  in 
Switzerland.  
Effective  action  by  banking  supervisory  authorities  is  key  to  ensuring  long-term  financial 
stability. However, the central banks also have a role to play in reinforcing the markets during 
times  of  need.  Once  the  current  crisis  is  over,  strengthening  banking  regulations  will  be 
absolutely  necessary  as  a  means  of  compelling  banks  to  adopt  a  more  circumspect 
approach.
