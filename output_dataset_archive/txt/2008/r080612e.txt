José De Gregorio: The Great Moderation and the risk of inflation – a view 
from developing countries 
Keynote  speech  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  at  the 
10th Geneva  Conference  on  the  World  Economy  “Low  inflation?  Testing  times  for  Central 
Banks",  organized  by  the  ICMB  (International  Center  for  Monetary  and  Banking  Studies), 
Geneva, 6 May 2008. 
I am very grateful to Christopher Neilson and Andrea Tokman for their great contributions and suggestions. 
 It is an honor to be a keynote speaker at this important gathering. Personally, this is a special 
meeting  as  I  contributed,  together  with  Barry  Eichengreen,  Takatoshi  Ito,  and  Charles 
Wyplosz, to the writing of the first report for this series of conferences back in 1999. It was 
lots of fun and an intellectual pleasure to work with such a great team of colleagues, and in 
such an important issue. In that first Geneva Report we wrote about the need to reform the 
IMF giving it independence, such as what we praise for central banks, and accountability, an 
essential  element  to  make  independence  effective.  In  the  future  I  would  like  to  develop 
further on those issues; however, today I will focus on an even more pressing debate in the 
recent  macro  juncture:  monetary  policy,  stability  and  the  current  risks  of  an  outburst  of 
inflation around the world, which is precisely the subject of this conference.  
I will first refer to the Great Moderation, an expression in use to describe the decline in output 
and  inflation  volatility  of  industrial  countries  in  the  last  twenty  years.  There  has  been 
significant  research  on  the  factors  behind  this  phenomenon,  better  monetary  policy  being 
one  of  them.  I  will  argue  that  in  developing  countries  the  Great  Moderation  was  achieved 
about  ten  years  ago  and  coincidentally  with  the  conquest  of  low  inflation.  The  timing  of 
events supports the hypothesis of a causal relationship from inflation control to decreased 
output and inflation volatility. Thus, improvements in monetary policy contribute to obtaining 
not only price stability but also output stability, or smoothed business cycles. I will argue that 
the  long  time  that  passed  between  the  great  moderation  in  industrial  countries  and 
developing ones, cast doubts on the validity and generality of hypotheses based on common 
positive shocks (“good luck”), such as the decline in oil prices and technological improvement 
(e.g., better inventory management). 
The second issue I will address is the prospect for maintaining stability in a context of severe 
inflationary  risks.  Indeed,  in  the  last  quarters  we  have  witnessed  one  of  the  largest 
inflationary  shock  in  the  post-World  War  II  period.  This  is  the  biggest  threat  we  have 
encountered  to  the  impressive  achievement  of  stable  business  cycles  and  low/stable 
inflation. Up to now, the shock has had enormous effects on the poor, as the prices of basic 
foodstuff have increased sharply. In addition, if inflation persists, the cost along the business 
cycle may become excruciating. I will close with some thoughts on the challenges ahead for 
monetary policy. 
The Great Moderation 
The  substantial  decline  in  macroeconomic  volatility  we  have  witnessed  in  the  US  and  the 
world  during  the  last  decades  has  been  widely  documented  by  a  substantial  body  of 
empirical research. Kim and Nelson (1999) and Blanchard and Simon (2001) were among 
the  first  to  point  at  this  phenomena  which  later  became  known  as  the  Great  Moderation. 
These latter authors found, for the US, that the variability of quarterly growth in real output 
had  declined  by  half  since  the  mid-1980s,  while  the  variability  of  inflation  had  declined  by 
about two thirds. Similar declines in the volatility of output and inflation occurred in most other 
G-7 countries roughly around the mid-eighties (Stock and Watson, 2003).

While we know that the control of inflation was achieved by the actions of monetary policy in 
the US, there is still an ongoing discussion regarding what caused the persistent decline in 
both  output  and  inflation  volatility.  In  general,  the  different  reasons  can  be  separated  into 
three groups: 
• 
The  first  argument  is  that  the  Great  Moderation  is  the  result  of  smaller  and  less 
frequent shocks hitting the economy. This would imply that the observed reduction 
in macroeconomic volatility would be the result of good fortune and would thus only 
last until bad luck or larger shocks were to re-appear. Several studies have provided 
support for the “good-luck hypothesis” (Ahmed, et al., 2002). 
A  second  related  explanation  is  focused  on  structural  and  technological  changes 
which  are  permanent  in  nature,  but  were  not  directly  caused  or  controlled  by 
macroeconomic  policies.  For  example,  a  special  type  of  technological  progress 
frequently  mentioned  in  the  discussion  of  output  volatility  refers  to  the  improved 
management  of  inventories.  If  a  significant  part  of  the  business  cycle  dynamics 
occurs  through  inventory  fluctuations,  “just  in  time”  technologies  and  better 
management  of  inventories  in  general  would  reduce  volatility  along  the  business 
cycle (McConnell and Perez-Quiroz, 2000; Cecchetti et al., 2005). Another important 
structural change is related to worldwide economic integration and globalization, as 
reviewed in the Geneva Report prepared for this conference (Gerlach et al., 2008). 
Cavallo (2007), for example, emphasizes that trade openness has reduced output 
volatility,  and  hence,  more  open  economies  are  also  more  stable.  This  evidence 
refutes the old view that more open economies are more exposed to volatility. On 
the  contrary,  Cavallo  (2007)  argues  that  more  open  economies  have  more 
opportunities to adjust to international shocks. Following this argument, the notable 
increase in openness all around the world would make all countries more stable.1  
A  third  and  final  factor  which  I  would  like  to  emphasize  is  related  to  improved 
monetary policy. These reforms have resulted in the reduction of not only inflation 
levels,  but  also  its  volatility.  Figure  1  shows  average  growth  and  inflation  over  an 
ample set of developing countries,2 while figure 2 shows the volatility of output and 
inflation. It can be seen that volatility declined in developing economies towards the 
mid-nineties. This is almost a decade after the developed economies experienced 
their “Great Moderation”. Thus, we can say that this evidence suggests there is a 
timing  mismatch  between  the  great  moderation  of  developed  and  developing 
economies.  
  The “good luck” hypothesis and the explanations based on structural factors cannot properly 
account  for  this  phenomenon.  If  volatility  had  fallen  only  due  to  good  luck,  then  luck  itself 
should have only been good for developed countries in the mid 1980s, which then took more 
than  10  years  to  arrive  to  help  developing  ones!  Similarly,  the  argument  of  increased 
productivity, such as better inventory management, has similar problems. It is difficult to think 
that businesses in developing countries adopted these better techniques more than 10 years 
later.3  
                                                 
1   Kent  et  al.  (2005)  examine  also  the  role  of  reforms  in  product  and  labor  markets  on  output  volatility  for  a 
sample of 20 OECD countries. For evidence in the case of Chile and estimations of reduced-form VARs, see 
Betancour et al. (2008). 
2   Seventy three economies classified as developing in the IFS data base and containing information since 1975. 
3   A similar point for the “good luck” hypothesis in the context of industrial countries has been made by Summers 
(2005).  He  argues  that  the  decline  in  volatility  of  growth  was  not  synchronized  among  industrial  countries 
given the common decline in oil prices. Looking at developing countries makes this point even stronger, since 
it  can  also  apply  to  inventory  management  and  other  forms  of  common  productivity  shocks  since  the 
asynchronicity is much more significant.

 BIS Review 74/2008
However, reforms regarding monetary policy have lagged noticeably in their adoption among 
developing  economies.  Central  bank  independence,  inflation  targeting  and  other  related 
policy  reforms  have  only  materialized  in  developing  economies  beginning  in  the  mid-90s 
which coincides with the fall in volatility in this group of countries. While structural changes, 
such as the increased openness, may have indeed helped economies become more stable, 
these  changes  must  also  include  those  related  to  monetary  policy  because  the  Great 
Moderation  coincides  with  inflation  control,  suggesting  that  improved  monetary  policy  has 
indeed played a major role.  
So, the relevant question is exactly how does monetary policy reduce the volatility of both 
output and inflation. We know that there is a tradeoff between output volatility and inflation 
variability,  and  monetary  policy  attempts  to  manage  this  tradeoff  optimally.  Policymakers 
have  to  decide  how  to  reduce  inflation  to  reach  their  goal.  If  they  react  forcefully  to  any 
inflation deviation, the outcome will be low inflation volatility, but large output volatility. Thus, 
in the long run, there is a tradeoff between inflation volatility and output volatility, although 
inflation has no effects on the full employment level of output. 
It  is  also  possible  to  practice  inefficient  monetary  policy,  one  which  lags  behind  the 
output/inflation  volatility  frontier,  making  both  of  these  inefficiently  large.  Bernanke  (2004) 
argues that in such a scenario of inefficient monetary policy, the volatility of both output and 
prices  can be  reduced  by  moving  to  better  policies.  In  other  words,  in  the  presence  of  an 
inadequate monetary policy, the outcome could be excessive volatility of output and inflation, 
and, hence, moving to an efficient policy can “shift the tradeoff to the origin” between output 
and  inflation  volatility,  reducing  both  of  them.  In  other  words,  improvements  in  monetary 
management can allow reaching an efficient frontier.  
For  example,  a  monetary  policy  that  reacts  insufficiently  to  changes  in  inflation,  without 
fulfilling the Taylor principle, or a policy too optimistic on the full employment level of output, 
could  end  up  generating  unnecessary  volatility  and  inflation.  These  are  reasonable 
explanations for the conduct of monetary policy in the US before the 1980s’ disinflation. This 
policy 
inefficiencies  could  be  even  aggravated  by  a  belief  on  a  permanent 
unemployment/inflation tradeoff, leading potentially to Friedman’s accelerationist hypothesis. 
However, I want to emphasize the credibility bonus that comes with commitment to inflation 
stabilization. In a standard Phillips curve framework, inflation depends on the output gap (the 
reason  for  the  output/inflation  volatility  tradeoff),  inflation  expectations,  and  a  set  of  other 
variables  including  inflationary  shocks.  Let’s  consider  the  case  of  low  credibility  in  a  low 
inflation objective. In such a case, an inflationary shock may feedback into price and wage 
formation,  requiring  a  more  aggressive  monetary  policy  response,  and  hence,  making  it 
costlier  to  reduce  inflation.  This  could  happen  when  expectations  are  not  only  forward 
looking, but have a high degree of inertia, due to, for example, high levels of indexation or 
lack  of  credibility.  In  contrast,  when  expectations  are  well-anchored  to  an  inflation  target, 
becoming  also  more  forward  looking,  the  monetary  policy  adjustment  required  to  achieve 
stable and low inflation is milder and the sacrifice ratio declines, reducing the volatility of both 
inflation and output.4
Of  course,  achieving  credibility  is  not  an  easy  task  and  can  be  done  through  different 
avenues.  Certainly  the  conquest  of  low  inflation,  as  occurred  in  developing  countries, 
increases  the  belief  in  policymakers’  competence  and  commitment  to  controlled  inflation. 
This  allows  stable  inflationary  expectations  and  reduces  inflation  persistence.  An  inflation 
target, with the necessary institutional support such as an independent central bank with a 
clear mandate to price stability, helps in this regard. It establishes an explicit commitment to 
keep inflation low and stable through time, and a strategy to adjust to deviations, including 
the time horizon in which this will be achieved. Indeed, among developing countries, those

that adopted inflation targeting regimes have had lower inflation and output volatility than the 
rest (figure 3). Of course, this evidence is only suggestive and the direction of the causality 
could  be  the  reverse,  with  more  stable  economies  being  more  prone  to  implementing  an 
inflation  targeting  regime.  The  empirical  evidence  on  this  subject  is  mixed,  but  generally  it 
has been found that inflation targeting does lower inflation and reduce its volatility.5 There is 
some evidence for emerging economies that inflation targeting also reduces growth volatility 
(Gonçalves and Salles, 2008). 
Bad luck is back: the risks of inflation 
Recently, the world has faced one of the worst inflationary shocks in the last 60 years. First, 
it happened with oil prices, which started rising sharply at the beginning of the decade, and 
has  climbed  to  record-high  levels  (figure  4).  However,  even  with  this  shock,  inflation  and 
output have been much less volatile than in previous oil price cycles. Lower oil-dependence 
and countercyclical fiscal policy explain part of the milder effects. Better monetary policy has 
also  contributed  to  substantially  reduce  the  impact  of  oil  shocks  on  output  and  activity.6 
However, the price of oil has kept increasing, and although its effects are smaller than in the 
past, the shock is becoming so large and persistent that it may have noticeable effects on 
inflation  and  output  over  the  coming  quarters.  On  the  bright  side,  however,  the  better 
monetary policy frameworks that are used today limit these effects. 
On  the  other  hand,  more  recently,  we  have  seen  an  impressive  increase  in  food  prices 
(figure  5),  with  serious  inflationary  effects  in  many  countries.  Food  prices  have  reached  in 
some  cases  their  highest  levels  in  history.  This  is  mainly  due  to  increased  demand  from 
emerging markets (especially China, India and oil-exporting countries), the use of grains as 
biofuels,  and  some  financial  factors  as  investors  have  increased  their  long  positions  in 
commodities. Since mid-2006 grain prices, measured by the CRB index, have climbed at an 
annual rate of 56%, contrasting with the trend observed between 1990 and mid-2006, when 
prices increased around 0.5% per year. This is a common trend for other commodity prices. 
Wheat prices registered a reduction of around 1% between 1990 and mid-2006, and a rise of 
121% since then, despite a partial reversion in the price during the last month. Similarly, rice 
prices, whose levels remained practically unchanged during 1990 and mid-2006, jumped to 
its peaks by increasing at annual rates of 71% since mid-2006. Finally, milk price, after falling 
at 0.3% per year during 1990-mid 2006, has increased at a 70% annual rate since then. 
The first-round price effects of the shock have been felt in sharp increases in foodstuff and 
energy while the rest of prices remain well behaved (figure 6). For example, in Chile inflation 
hovers at about 8%, four points above the ceiling of our comfort zone (2 to 4%), mainly due 
to the rise in foodstuff and energy prices. Indeed, non-food non-energy inflation is still close 
to 3%. Foodstuff prices have increased further due to weather problems (frosts in 2007 and 
drought in 2008). 
The nature of these price hikes is purely international, or related to weather, making them 
unavoidable  from  the  point  of  view  of  monetary  authorities.  However,  their  potential 
propagation to other prices and wages through what we normally call second-round effects 
gives monetary policy an important role even in the presence of these specific external price 
shocks. Given the nature of the shock, driven to a large extent by biofuel production and food 
demand in fast-growing Asian countries, the shock is likely to persist for a long time. Some 
                                                 
5   Truman (2003), Hyvonen (2004) and Vega and Winkelried (2005), among others. Ball and Sheridan (2005) 
show  that  the  available  evidence  does  not  support  this  conclusion  for  developed  economies.  Mishkin  and 
Schmidt-Hebbel  (2007)  corroborate  this  differentiated  benefit,  and  conclude  that  the  winners  are  emerging 
economies and converging-to-target ITers. Still, they conclude that the choice of the control group is key for 
finding any effect of IT on inflation. 
6   De Gregorio et al. (2007) and Blanchard and Gali (2007) show evidence supporting these views.

second-round  effects  are  bound  to  happen,  since  price  and  wage  formation  always  have 
some  degree  of  inertia.  The  role  of  monetary  policy  is  to  ensure  that  the  adjustment  of 
relative  prices  occurs  without  a  persistent  increase  in  inflation,  that  is,  beyond  normal 
dynamics.  Put  differently,  monetary  policy  must  guarantee  that  the  dynamic  of  prices  is 
consistent with convergence of inflation to its objective, within the time horizon envisioned in 
the inflation target regime. That is, monetary policy must worry about, and act upon, unstable 
dynamics that can lead to increases in inflation that may later be too costly to contain. These 
are the undesired second-round effects that may require strong monetary policy actions. 
In a flexible inflation targeting regime, once there are deviations from the target, monetary 
policy is implemented on the basis of bringing back inflation projection towards the targeted 
level within a given time horizon. In Chile, this would mean bringing down projected inflation 
to 3% in the two year horizon. This length of the horizon takes into account the lags in the 
effects  of  monetary  policy,  as  well  as  the  fact  that  bringing  back  inflation  to  target  has  an 
output cost. It also allows for transitory shocks to undo their effects without shifting the path 
of  monetary  policy.  Therefore,  in  the  current  context  of  sharp  inflationary  pressures, 
monetary policy must avoid undesired second-round effects, which are those that generate 
an adjustment longer than the one envisioned in the policy horizon. 
In  order  to  monitor  these  potentially  undesired  second-round  effects,  we  scrutinize  price 
dynamics that appear to be out of the normal. For example, we follow the evolution of wages 
compared to an estimated evolution of wages based on the historical patterns of indexation. 
If  wages  are  growing  faster  than  these  estimates,  we  could  be  facing  worrisome  wage 
dynamics that may require a policy reaction. 
In this scenario, it could be argued that one could relax the policy horizon or the target level 
to accommodate these inflationary shocks with small output costs. However, based on my 
previous discussion, this could be very detrimental for the future. Giving up on inflation will 
lead  to  losing  the  inflation  anchor  on  expectations,  more  backward-  than  forward-looking 
behavior of wage and price setters, and an increase in output volatility. In other words, we 
would be achieving an inefficient outcome for monetary policy and losing the benefits of the 
Great Moderation. 
Hence, central banks must carefully monitor inflation expectations. However, in the current 
juncture of extreme uncertainty and inflation volatility, the breakeven measures that compare 
nominal  and  inflation  protected  securities  appear  to  be  excessively  high  world-wide,  thus 
apparently showing an important increase in inflation expectations, which could even reflect 
the loss of the nominal anchor. This has also been the case in Chile, especially since the 
deepness  of  the  market  of  inflation  protected  instruments  tends  to  make  them  the  natural 
safe  haven.  Therefore, in  uncertain  times  like  the  ones  we  are  enduring  today,  breakeven 
measures  may  increase  without  necessarily  implying  un-anchoring  expectations,  making 
their timely recognition more intricate. 
Some  could  incorrectly  argue  that  a  way  to  avoid  the  monetary  policy  reaction  to  some 
specific inflationary shocks is to focus inflation control on core rather than headline measures 
of inflation. This is a much debated issue, but in the context of the current discussion I would 
like to add that above the problem of doing the change in target in an opportunistic way and 
the impact it may have on credibility, there is a more profound reason why focusing on core 
versus headline inflation is not an issue in the current environment, where commodity prices 
have already increased substantially. In the present scenario, second-round effects appear in 
all  prices.  For  example,  a  rapid  increase  in  wages,  due  to  backward  looking  indexation  or 
other type of inertia, will affect all prices through the cost channel, and hence, a pernicious 
dynamic  of  inflation  will  be  noticeable  in  both  headline  and  core  inflation.  Indeed,  a 
reasonable adjustment should have foodstuff and energy price inflation falling sharply after 
the relative price adjustment has taken place, and core inflation adjusting from a higher level 
to the target. Once food and energy prices level out, the propagation of inflation could be a 
more serious problem for countries that focus its target on core inflation.

Challenges to monetary policy 
Current inflationary shocks pose a serious threat to monetary policy. The recent adjustment 
has been uneven across countries. Many have been trying to avoid the increase in prices via 
subsidies, taxes or plain price controls. However, it is by now clear that relative prices must 
adjust, given the persistency of the shock and the need for appropriate signals for efficient 
resource reallocation. On the other hand, there are countries, such as Chile, where changes 
in  costs  are  regularly  passed  on  to  consumer  prices,  because  markets  for  foodstuff  are 
globally integrated and competitive. Hence, a large part of the inflationary shock has been 
already  absorbed.  However,  we  have  continuously  witnessed  a  flow  of  bad  news  on 
commodity prices, and inflationary shocks keep hitting us, but the benefits that the flexible 
inflation targeting regime brings in terms of price stability and credibility must be maintained. 
There  is  no  doubt  from  the  developing  countries’  perspective  that  this  is  an  important 
conquest and cannot be abandoned, least of all in these difficult times. 
The world economy is in a very complex situation. It is far from the disastrous 1970s, but we 
are in the presence of a slowdown with high risks of inflation. We are at a moment in which 
monetary  policy  is  put  under  a  serious  stress  test  that  will  be  crucial  in  identifying  future 
refinements in the policy frameworks. Particularly important in the US and industrial countries 
is the interaction between price and financial stability. From a policymaker’s point of view, we 
must ensure that all the benefits achieved during the great moderation phase are preserved. 
It would be irresponsible to return to times of instability while searching for short-lived gains.

calculated as the YoY \% change in GDP volume as given by IFS line 99b. Averages are taken over all countries 
that have data available from 1975. Industrial and developing status of countries has been taken directly from IFS.
