Svante Öberg: Wage formation and monetary policy 
Speech  by  Mr  Svante  Öberg,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  Folkets  hus, 
Stockholm, 5 December 2008. 
 My speech today is supposed to be about wage formation and monetary policy,  and I will 
devote most of my time here to this subject. However, given that we brought the monetary 
policy meeting forward to Wednesday and that we then reduced the repo rate to 2 per cent. I 
would  like  to  begin  by  saying  a  few  words  about  this  decision.  As  you  may  know,  the 
members  of  the  Executive  Board  do  not  usually  discuss  their  own  position  on  the  latest 
interest rate decision until the minutes of the meeting have been published. It is only then 
that the views of the individual members are presented officially. The minutes of the meeting 
on  Wednesday  will  be  published  on  17  December.  My  comments  on  the  interest  rate 
decision and the current situation thus reflect the collective view of the Executive Board. 
We chose to move the monetary policy meeting forward by two weeks because it became 
clear to us at an early stage that there was a need for a significant reduction in the repo rate. 
In  the  prevailing  situation,  our  assessment  was  that  it  was  important  to  make  a  quick 
decision. We thus reduced the repo rate by 1.75 percentage points. This is a substantial cut 
and it has been made on the grounds that since the previous Monetary Policy Report was 
published  in  October  there  has  been  an  unexpectedly  rapid  and  tangible  downturn  in 
economic activity in Sweden and abroad. So, in order to prevent development being far too 
weak and inflation too low, a significant reduction in the repo rate was required. The fact that 
the interest rate needed to be cut substantially is also due to monetary policy not having such 
a large impact recently as it normally does. With lower policy rates and a more expansionary 
fiscal policy in Sweden and abroad, we expect to see an easing-off in the slowdown of the 
economy and a recovery at the end of 2009.  
In this acute situation, one may wonder whether wage formation is something that we need 
to  discuss  just  now.  Obviously,  wage  formation  is  not  the  most  central  issue  for  monetary 
policy at the moment. At the same time, it is important to be able to stand firm when a storm 
is brewing. Today, the Swedish economy stands on much firmer foundations than it did in the 
early 1990s – largely thanks to the lessons that we learned from the crisis at that time and 
the improvements that have been made in the functioning of the economy since then. I would 
claim that wage formation has been an important element of this and I intend to explain this 
in more detail in my speech today. At the end of my speech, I also intend to give you my 
personal view on a question that has emerged in the wake of the latest round of collective 
bargaining, namely which sector should reach an agreement first and thus set the norm for 
wage increases in other sectors.  
However, perhaps the first question that should be asked is why the Riksbank should show 
any interest at all in the functioning of wage formation. Wage formation and monetary policy 
are  interrelated.  The  Riksbank  is  not  a  party  in  the  collective  bargaining  process.  It  is  the 
social  partners  that  conduct  collective  bargaining.  But  the  development  of  wages  affects 
inflation  and  inflation  affects  the  development  of  wages.  Our  job  is  to  maintain  a  low  and 
stable level of inflation. This job is made easier if wage formation works well.  
My speech today can be summed up in the following four points: 
• 
Wage formation has functioned better in the last fifteen years than in the 1970s and 
1980s.  
Cost  increases  are  higher  in  the  current  agreement  period  than  in  the  preceding 
agreement periods.

  The economy is weakening, inflation is falling rapidly and the Riksbank is reducing 
the interest rate.  
The sector that is exposed to international competition should also set the norm for 
wage development in collective bargaining in 2010.  
The speech is structured in line with these four points.  
I  would  also  like  to  make  it  clear  that  the  views  on  wage  formation  that  I  express  in  this 
speech today are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Executive 
Board of the Riksbank. 
Wage formation in a longer perspective 
High wage increases and devaluations in the 1970s and 1980s 
I think that every one here would agree that wage formation has functioned better in the last 
fifteen  years  than  in  the  1970s  and  1980s.  One  way  of  illustrating  this  is  to  compare  the 
development of inflation in Sweden and Germany. In the 1960s, inflation was on average just 
over one percentage point higher in Sweden than in Germany.  
Following  the  breakdown  of  the  Bretton  Woods  system  in  the  early  1970s,  inflation  in 
Germany was seen as a nominal anchor for inflation in Sweden in that the Swedish krona 
was pegged to a currency basket dominated by the D-mark. 
This strategy did not work. During the 1970s and 1980s, inflation in Sweden was on average 
more than four percentage points higher than in Germany (see Figure 1).  
This is largely related to the development of labour costs in the two countries. Labour costs 
per  produced  unit  –  unit  labour  costs  –  increased  much  more  rapidly  in  Sweden  than  in 
Germany during the 1970s and 1980s (see Figure 2).  
In  order  to  increase  the  competitiveness  of  Swedish  industry,  the  Swedish  krona  was 
devalued several times in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The exchange rate of the krona 
against the D-mark was thus significantly weakened over a long period of time. 
This  meant  that  Sweden's  competitiveness  in  relation  to  Germany  actually  increased 
somewhat.1  However,  a  comparison  of  unit  labour  costs  in  Sweden  and  Germany  in  the 
same  currency  shows  that  the  difference  just  before  the  crisis  in  the  early  1990s  was 
nevertheless approaching the same level as prior to the devaluations at the beginning of the 
1980s.  As  the  social  partners  were  able  to  count  on  devaluations,  there  was  no  strong 
incentive to try to avoid cost problems. 
The  problems  worsened  during  the  second  half  of  the  1980s  and  the  early  1990s  when 
Sweden  suffered  a  period  that,  in  many  respects,  can  be  described  as  a  classic  financial 
crisis.  The  phase-out  of  credit  and  currency  regulations  was  followed  by  a  dramatic 
expansion of credit, overheating of the economy, major current account deficits and, finally, a 
collapse. 
Inflation in Sweden in line with that in Germany since the early 1990s  
Since  the  beginning  of  the  1990s,  inflation  in  Sweden  has  been  roughly  the  same  as  in 
Germany (see Figure 1). There are of course several reasons why inflation in Sweden has 
fallen to a low and relatively stable level. The crisis that Sweden suffered in the early 1990s

currency.

was  the  most  serious  recession  since  the  Depression  of  the  1930s.  GDP  declined  three 
years in succession and employment fell by over 500 000. This also pushed inflation down to 
a low level. When it was decided that the krona would no longer be pegged against the ecu 
in November 1992, a monetary and foreign exchange policy was introduced with a floating 
exchange rate and an inflation target of 2 per cent. Fiscal policy was tightened. The budget 
consolidation  process  of  the  mid-1990s  was  quite  drastic  in  international  terms  and  also 
helped to subdue inflation, even though the krona had weakened by approximately 25 per 
cent  directly  after  the  introduction  of  the  floating  exchange  rate.  This  was  something  that 
Sweden did not manage to do after the devaluations of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The 
Riksbank  was  eventually  given  an  independent  position  with  the  aim  of  increasing  the 
credibility of the inflation target, which the Riksbank also managed to do.  
the  basis  of 
the  so-called  Rehnberg  Commission.  On 
Improvements in wage formation have contributed to positive development 
Another important reason why inflation in Sweden has been able to stay in step with inflation 
in Germany, and nowadays in the euro area, is that wage formation has improved.  
During  the  1980s,  it  became  increasingly  evident  that  Swedish  wage  formation  did  not 
function in a manner compatible with economic balance. Collective bargaining often began 
only  when  the  previous  agreements  had  expired,  which  meant  that  negotiations  were 
conducted under more strained circumstances without the obligation to refrain from industrial 
action.  The  wage  agreements  contained  guarantees  on  the  development  of  prices,  wages 
and  earnings,  as  well  as  renegotiation  clauses,  which  contributed  to  a  situation  in  which 
prices  and  wages  chased  each  other  in  an  upward  spiral.  The  levels  stipulated  in  the 
agreements were often minimum levels above which there was considerable wage drift. 
Several factors have contributed to the improvement in wage formation. In March 1990, the 
government  appointed 
the 
Commission's proposals, stabilisation agreements were signed in most areas of the labour 
market. These helped to reduce the rate of wage increases from around 10 per cent in 1990 
to  3-4  per  cent  per  year  in  1992-1993,  and  to  ensure  that  the  agreements  no  longer 
contained any flexibility clauses.  
In  March  1997,  the  social  partners  in  the  industrial  sector  signed  a  new  cooperation 
agreement, the so-called Industrial Agreement. This covered regulations on the conduct of 
collective bargaining and established the partners' joint responsibility for wage formation in 
their  part  of  the  labour  market.  Similar  agreements,  although  not  as  far-reaching,  have 
followed in other areas. 
In 2000, the new National Mediation Office began work. This established a third, independent 
party on the labour market with the task of promoting an effective wage formation process. 
The National Mediation Office was also given increased powers to take action in connection 
with collective bargaining. The National Institute of Economic Research was given the task of 
annually  producing  reports  on  the  economic  conditions  for  wage  formation,  the  "Wage 
Formation in Sweden" reports. 
Over the last 15 years, the national agreements have largely entailed wage levels that have 
been  very  compatible  with  low  and  stable  inflation  and  the  positive  development  of 
production  and  employment.  The  collective  bargaining  rounds  have  begun  in  good  time 
before  the  expiry  of  the  old  agreements.  The  sector  that  is  exposed  to  international 
competition  has  normally  come  to  an  agreement  first  and  has  thus  set  the  norm  for  other 
parts of the economy. The agreements have usually run over three years. They no longer 
contain flexibility clauses that lead to wages and prices chasing one another in an upward 
spiral. At the same time, wage formation within the national frameworks has provided scope 
for considerable variations between companies and individuals. The number of labour market 
conflicts has been lower than before.

The fact that wage formation has worked relatively well over the last 15 years has also made 
it possible for Sweden to maintain, or even increase, its international competitiveness since 
we stopped pegging the krona to the ecu in November 1992. One difference compared to 
previous  episodes  is  that,  since  1993,  unit  labour  costs  in  Sweden  have  increased  at  the 
same  rate  as  in  Germany.  This  is  an  important  explanation  of  the  similar  development  of 
inflation in the two countries. The nominal exchange rate has been strikingly stable up to the 
point when the financial crisis worsened in September. Costs in the Swedish manufacturing 
industry  have  fallen  in  the  last  15  years  in  comparison  with  those  in  a  large  group  of 
countries  (see  Figure  3).  Swedish  exports  have  increased  dramatically  and  the  current 
account is showing a large surplus.  
The development of real wages is an additional way of illustrating that wage formation has 
functioned better in the last 15 years than in the 1970s and 1980s. In the period 1997-2007, 
the average increase in real wages was 2.5 per cent per year. There has not been such an 
extended  period  with  real  wage  increases  since  the  1960s.  This  can  be  compared  to  the 
period 1970-1992, when the average increase in real wages was 0.7 per cent. Real wages 
actually fell in several years during the 1980s and early 1990s (see Figure 4).  
Wages and costs in the current agreement period 
I now come to my second point, which concerns wages and costs in the current agreement 
period. As far as we can judge at the moment, cost increases will be higher in the current 
agreement  period  than  in  the  preceding  agreement  periods.  Wage  increases  will  be 
somewhat higher and the development of productivity much weaker. 
Higher wage agreements in 2007 than in preceding agreements 
I personally was rather optimistic ahead of the rounds of collective bargaining in the spring of 
2007  in  the  sense  that  they  would  mainly  be  conducted  in  good  time  before  the  old 
agreements  expired  and  without  serious  conflicts,  and  that  they  would  result  in  wage 
increases  that  were  compatible  with  the  Riksbank's  inflation  target.  My  assessment  was 
based on three factors.  
Firstly,  the  economic  conditions  prior  to  the  bargaining  rounds  were  good.  Wages  had 
increased  moderately  in  the  preceding  years  and  there  was  spare  capacity  on  the  labour 
market.  Secondly,  wage  formation  had  improved  since  the  crisis  at  the  beginning  of  the 
1990s. Thirdly, the monetary policy framework had improved and thereby the conditions for 
maintaining low and stable inflation. The public's expectations were that inflation would be 
around the target of 2 per cent per year.  
At the same time, my assessment was that the risks were on the "upside", that is that it was 
possible that wage increases could be higher. There was strong growth in the economy and 
employment was increasing rapidly. Despite the positive experience of the preceding years, 
there  was  a  possibility  that  the  rounds  of  collective  bargaining  could  be  much  less 
straightforward than expected. Market forces could also push up the rate of wage increases 
to higher levels. 
I became more concerned when the content of the agreements became apparent. The levels 
of  the  agreed  wage  increases  were  significantly  higher  than  in  the  preceding  rounds  of 
collective bargaining. The outcome was similar to the risk scenario that we presented in a 
Monetary  Policy  Report  in  February  2007  before  the  collective  bargaining  process  began. 
This undermined the possibility to conduct a relatively expansionary monetary policy with low 
interest rates and still reach the inflation target.

Somewhat higher wage increases in 2007-2009 than in the preceding agreement 
period 
In February 2007, the Riksbank's assessment was that hourly wages would increase by 3.9 
per cent per year in the three-year period 2007-2009. When more information on the result of 
the  rounds  of  collective  bargaining  became  available  in  June  2007,  this  assessment  was 
increased to 4.2 per cent per year. My personal belief was that hourly wages would increase 
more than this. 
Since the spring of 2007, the development of the economy has been much weaker than we 
expected.  The  crisis  on  the  financial  markets  has  entailed  a  dramatic  downturn  in  the  US 
economy which has had a dampening effect on economic development in other countries, 
including Sweden. This can in turn have made the companies more cost conscious and less 
willing  to  employ  new  personnel  and  increase  wages  above  the  levels  stipulated  in  the 
agreements.  
It is therefore reasonable to assume that there will be lower wage increases during the three-
year  agreement  period  than  we  could  predict  in  2007.  Our  assessment  now  is  that  hourly 
wages will increase on average by 3.7 per cent per year during the three-year period 2007-
2009 measured using the National Mediation Office's method for presenting statistics, and by 
three  tenths  more  using  the  method  for  presenting  wage  developments  in  the  National 
Accounts.  This  is  around  half  a  percentage  point  per  year  more  than  during  the  previous 
three-year agreement period.  
… and a weaker development of productivity will lead to higher cost increases  
Labour  costs  per  produced  unit  have,  however,  increased  considerably  more  than  we 
expected in the spring of 2007 as the development of productivity has been much weaker 
than we predicted at that time. In February 2007, we predicted that unit labour costs would 
increase by 2.3 per cent per year during the period 2007-2009. 
We now calculate that unit labour costs will increase by an average of 3.8 per cent per year 
in 2007-2009 compared to the figure of practically zero per cent per year in 2004-2006 (see 
Figure  5).  This  means  that  many  companies  are  now  faced  with  the  choice  of  either 
increasing their prices to counteract the decline in profitability, which may be difficult in the 
present situation with a steady decline in demand, or of making staff cuts. Our assessment is 
that  the  companies  will  probably  choose  the  latter.  Price  increases  will  be  moderate  while 
employment will decrease significantly. 
In the three preceding agreement periods, the high rate of increase in productivity helped to 
keep  unit  labour  costs  down.  The  growth  of  productivity  was  surprisingly  strong;  certainly 
much stronger than many of us expected when the agreements were negotiated. 
Productivity has now fallen in seven consecutive quarters (see Figure 6). My impression is 
that the recent development of productivity is in all essentials a result of weaker economic 
activity.  Growth  has  declined  rapidly  while  the  number  of  people  in  employment  has 
continued to increase.  
If we study how GDP and employment vary over the economic cycle it becomes clear that 
there is a time lag in the cyclical fluctuation in employment in relation to production. It also 
appears that this time lag has increased since the beginning of the 1990s (see Figure 7). 
The Riksbank's assessment is that a recovery in the growth of productivity is probable over 
the  next  few  years.  This  is  indicated,  for  example,  by  the  historical  links  that  I  have  just 
mentioned. However, we do not expect the rate of growth to be as high as between 2002 and 
2006. In the latest Monetary Policy Update, the assessment is that the growth of productivity 
in 2010 and 2011 will average over 2.5 per cent. 
It  is  more  difficult  to  assess  the  growth  of  productivity  in  the  longer  term.  A  number  of 
explanations  have  been  put  forward  for  the  rapid  development  of  productivity  up  to  and 
BIS Review 154/2008

including  2006.  The  IT  sector  is  relatively  large  in  Sweden;  IT  investments  have  been 
extensive; the previous phase-out of product markets has increased competition; Sweden is 
a  small,  open  economy  which  also  leads  to  great  competitive  pressure  and  so  on.  My 
impression  is  that  IT  will  continue  to  contribute  to  a  relatively  rapid  development  of 
productivity in Sweden, while higher real interest rates and energy prices may subdue the 
rate of growth. All in all, we expect to see a lower long-term rate of increase than we saw 
from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s.  
The current economic situation and monetary policy 
I  will  now  briefly  address  current  monetary  policy.  The  situation  can  be  summed  up  as 
follows: the economy is weakening, inflation is falling rapidly and the Riksbank is reducing 
the interest rate.  
The financial crisis is reinforcing the downturn in economic activity 
GDP growth is now declining in Sweden and abroad. We expect to see negative growth in 
the Swedish economy next year (see Figure 8). It is predicted that employment will fall by 
approximately  120  000  over  the  next  two  years  and  that  unemployment  will  rise  to 
approximately  8.4  per  cent  (see  Figures  9  and  10).  An  important  reason  for  the  dramatic 
downturn  in  economic  activity  we  see  ahead  of  us  is  that  the  global  financial  crisis  has 
worsened during the autumn. 
Inflation has been unusually high over the past year. But it will probably fall rapidly in the year 
ahead. In the USA it has fallen in three consecutive months and in the euro area it fell to 2.1 
per  cent  in  November.  In  Sweden,  inflation  fell  to  4.0  per  cent  in  October,  but  our 
assessment is that it has fallen significantly in November here too (see Figure 11).  
Inflation is high but is declining rapidly 
One  of  the  issues  that  we  have  had  to  take  note  of  during  the  year  has  been  the 
considerable  fluctuation  in  the  prices  of  food  and  energy.  One  of  the  reasons  that  we 
increased the interest rate in the period up to the autumn was to prevent the price increases 
that  started  on  the  world  market  spreading  to  other  areas  via  price-setting  and  wage 
formation. 
During the year, I have argued that it did not appear to be especially likely that short-term 
increases in the prices of food and energy would push up wages by leading to demands for 
compensation  for  the  price  increases.  The  slowdown  in  growth  and  the  weakening  of  the 
labour market are factors that weighed against such a scenario. There are also three-year 
agreements on large sections of the labour market that regulate agreed pay increases and 
these do not contain, as was the case in the 1970s and 1980s and is still the case in some 
other countries, price development guarantees that provide automatic compensation for price 
increases.  On  the  other  hand,  I  have  pointed  out  the  importance  of  inflation  and  inflation 
expectations  coming  down  to  around  2  per  cent  ahead  of  the  next  round  of  collective 
bargaining in 2010.  
I  have  been  more  concerned  about  the  effects  of  increases  in  food  and  energy  prices 
spreading to other prices in the economy. For example, I have pointed out that food prices 
have increased more rapidly in Sweden than in the euro area and that the business tendency 
survey has indicated that the retail sector still planned to increase prices. This indicates that 
price  increases  in  the  world  market  could  spread  to  other  goods.  The  risk  of  such  a 
development  has  now  declined  in  that  energy  and  food  prices  have  fallen  on  the  world 
markets and the plans to increase prices in the food retail sector are no longer so definite. 
The decline in demand in Sweden and abroad is further reducing the risk of these contagion 
effects.

 BIS Review 154/2008
The  Riksbank  has  analysed  what  is  referred  to  as  the  persistency  of  inflation,  that  is  how 
long the effects of a sudden increase or decrease in inflation endure. We identify two main 
results for Sweden, which are similar to the results of studies of the euro area. First, there is 
a degree of persistency in inflation, but it can be regarded as moderate. This result means, in 
simple  terms,  that  half  of  the  effect  of  a  sudden  increase  in  inflation  remains  in  the  next 
quarter.  
Second,  persistency  has  declined  since  the  inflation  target  was  introduced.  One  possible 
explanation is that monetary policy has gained greater credibility. There is more confidence 
than previously that monetary policy endeavours to bring inflation back to the target following 
shocks.  Another  possible  explanation  is  that,  since  the  mid-1990s,  the  shocks  have  been 
less  extensive  than  previously,  partly  because  wage  formation  has  functioned  better  than 
before. 
A conceivable conclusion from a monetary policy point of view is that it can nevertheless be 
risky to underestimate persistency. This is because the costs of bringing inflation down are 
high once it has been allowed to overshoot the target. It is therefore better to assume a too 
high rather than a too low level of persistency.  
Thoughts ahead of collective bargaining in 2010 
I  would  now  like  to  make  some  personal  observations  on  a  matter  that  may  be  important 
ahead of the next major round of collective bargaining in 2010 regarding which sector should 
set the norm for wage increases. My view is that the sector that is exposed to international 
competition should also set the norm for wage development in collective bargaining in 2010. 
There has recently been a lot of discussion about the current wage formation system.2 One 
question  has  been  whether  the  system  with  the  manufacturing  industry  as  the  sole  norm 
setter  is  the  most  appropriate  and  sustainable  option  given  that  we  now  have  a  floating 
exchange rate instead of a fixed exchange rate. The argument is that the same restraining 
effect on wage formation could now be achieved if the service sector sets the norm rather 
than the manufacturing industry. The idea is that if the service sector sets the norm too high, 
the Riksbank would increase the interest rate and that this would dampen economic activity, 
employment and inflation in the same way as if the manufacturing industry set the norm too 
high and lost international competitiveness. 
The sector exposed to international competition should set the norm  
My own view is that the sector exposed to international competition still has a central role to 
play  in  wage  formation.  But  this  sector  should  not  be  equated  with  the  manufacturing 
industry. Other sectors are also exposed to international competition to varying degrees. It is 
also important that there is consensus between the negotiating organisations on what part of 
the economy should set the norm. 
I do not think that there is any major difference between the previous situation with a fixed 
exchange rate and the present situation with a floating exchange rate. Our inflation target is 
largely the same as in other countries. As we saw earlier, inflation over the last 15 years has 
also been more or less the same in Sweden and Germany. 
The only way that we can have higher wage increases is if the development of productivity in 
Sweden  is  higher  than  in  other  countries.  This  has  also  been  the  case  if  we  look  at 
developments  in  Sweden  compared  to  developments  in  the  euro  area  since  2000.  Wages

have  increased  more  rapidly  in  Sweden  than  in  the  euro  area,  but  the  development  of 
productivity  has  also  been  stronger  in  Sweden  while  inflation  has  been  approximately  the 
same (see Figure 12). 
For the manufacturing industry, the situation is largely the same in an exchange rate regime 
with a floating rate as in a regime with a fixed rate in the sense that the wage agreements 
must look to the future with regard to the development of costs abroad. Normally, it may be 
reasonable to assume that the exchange rate remains unchanged, which is illustrated by the 
stable development of the krona against the euro from 2002 until this autumn. A hypothesis 
of  an  unchanged  exchange  rate  provides  the  same  conditions  under  fixed  and  floating 
exchange rate regimes.  
The  krona  has  weakened  significantly  in  the  course  of  the  ongoing  financial  turbulence, 
although in the long term we expect it to return to roughly the same level it was at before the 
crisis. Hopefully, the krona will have stabilised at a higher level than the present level before 
the round of collective bargaining in 2010. This is at least what the Riksbank believes (see 
Figure 13). 
For the service sector, however, the situation is different in the case of a floating exchange 
rate. If the service sector sets the norm for wage increases and the increases are higher than 
the level compatible with the inflation target, the Riksbank will, under normal circumstances, 
raise the interest rate. This normally results in a strengthening of the krona and a dampening 
of  economic  activity  and  inflation.  For  the  manufacturing  industry  this  leads  to  a  double-
edged pressure on competitiveness in that wages increase more than in other countries at 
the same time as the krona is strengthened. 
However, the restraining effect of too high wage increases in the service sector is less direct 
and less tangible than the effect of too high wage increases in the manufacturing industry. 
The  effect  of  too  high  wage  increases  in  the  service  sector  must  be  explained  in  several 
stages (higher wages, higher inflation, interest rate increases, lower real growth and so on) 
while the effect of too high wage increases in the manufacturing industry has a direct impact 
on the competitiveness of industrial companies.  
The  normative  role  of  the  manufacturing  industry  is  also  dependent  on  more  than  the  fact 
that it is a part of the Swedish economy that is exposed to international competition. In the 
Industrial Agreement, the social partners have agreed on a process in which negotiations are 
conducted under the obligation to refrain from industrial action and in good time before the 
old agreements expire, as well as on specific processes for handling conflicts, a joint basis 
for negotiations and so on.  
I  therefore  conclude  that  the  manufacturing  industry,  with  a  possible  expansion  to  include 
other  parts  of  the  Swedish  economy  that  are  exposed  to  international  competition,  should 
also set the norm for the development of wages in the round of collective bargaining that will 
be held in 2010. A broad consensus that this is an appropriate process would facilitate the 
negotiations and contribute to effective wage formation.  
At the same time, I would like to conclude by emphasising that the Riksbank is not a party in 
the collective bargaining process. It is the social partners that conduct collective bargaining. 
But  the  development  of  wages  affects  inflation  and  inflation  affects  the  development  of 
wages. Our job is to maintain a low and stable level of inflation. This job is made easier if 
wage formation works well.  
Thank you!
