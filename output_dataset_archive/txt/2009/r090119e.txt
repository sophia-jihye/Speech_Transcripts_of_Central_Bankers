John Gieve: Economic prospects and the policy challenge 
Speech by Sir John Gieve, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, at the Cityco Breakfast 
Meeting, Manchester, 16 January 2009. 
 Introduction  
One of the things that strikes me most on coming back to Manchester is the pace at which 
the fabric of the city changes – and I was looking at this yesterday from up on the 23rd floor. 
It’s not much more than two years since I was last here but in that time the city centre has 
added about half a million square feet of retail space, more than 1½ million sq ft of new office 
space and nearly 8000 extra hotel beds (a 40% increase). 
All  this  development  reflects  the  attractiveness  of  Manchester  as  a  location  for  inward 
investment  and  even  more  importantly  the  strong  growth  in  businesses  indigenous  to  the 
city, many of which are represented today. But while I gather that nearly a million square feet 
of office space has been let again in 2008 it is clear that in Manchester, as elsewhere, the 
past year has been increasingly challenging for businesses of all types and the prospect is 
forbidding. 
The severity and nature of the challenges we face particularly in the banking sector makes it 
very difficult to predict where we will be in a year from now. And the pace of change means 
that  it  is  even  more  true  today  than  usual  that  we  cannot  rely  for  navigation  on  official 
statistics  alone.  So  as  members  of  the  Monetary  Policy  Committee  we  see  it  as  more 
important than ever to make visits such as this so that we can talk to businesses face to face 
about the conditions they are experiencing on the ground. And every month our Agents in the 
regions, including the North West, give us a comprehensive report based on a large number 
of meetings with contacts in all sectors of the economy. 
2009 is certain to be a difficult year for the UK and the global economy more generally. In the 
United Kingdom, we expect the sharpest fall in output for decades while on some measures, 
retail prices are likely to fall for the first time in almost half a century. We are not alone in our 
difficulties. Most of our major trading partners are also entering recession. A decade or more 
of remarkable macroeconomic stability; the Great Stability as economists called it, has come 
to a shuddering halt. 
These exceptional developments have led already to exceptional policy measures. Here in 
the United Kingdom, the government has set in train a fiscal expansion and has stepped in to 
support the banking system and lending. And earlier this month, we reduced official interest 
rates to an historic low of 1.5%. Similar measures have been taken overseas. 
My  purpose  today  is  to  explain  how  this  recession  differs  from  the  others  I  have  lived 
through,  why  that  calls  for  a  wider  range  of  responses  than  normal,  and  the  difference 
between the policy objectives in the medium term and the short term. 
The boom before the bust? 
What is striking about the run-up to this recession is that we did not see the booms in output, 
employment  and  wages  that  led  to  past  recessions.  Past  recessions,  in  good  measure, 
reflected deliberate decisions by policymakers to rein in spending and damp the inflationary 
pressures that had been building up. The rise in interest rates then led to a correction in the 
spending behaviour of households and companies as optimism about future income growth 
in the boom turned to uncertainty and gloom in the bust.  
Chart 1 highlights what was happening to domestic output in the two years before the last 
three recessions. The Barber Boom was a case in point, when output rose by 10% over the 
BIS Review 5/2009 
 1
year to 1973 Q1, and then fell by 3% over the following year. You can see a similar pattern 
before the recessions of the early 80s and early 90s. But in 2006 and early 2007 growth was 
close to its average over the past 30 years. 
That  is  not  the  whole  story  of  course.  When  we  look  at  asset  markets,  a  different  story 
emerges. The credit boom  may not have led to a rapid inflation in the price of goods and 
services, but it did support a surge in the price of a broad range of assets. Property prices 
soared  (Chart  2).  The  price  of  stocks  and  bonds  also  rebounded  strongly  from  their  early 
decade lows.  
That  rise  in  prices  was  driven  by  and  reflected  in  a  sustained  rise  in  borrowing.  A 
combination  of  factors  –  including a  large  flow  of  savings  out  of  the  emerging  economies, 
and a reduction in the return that investors required to bear risk – had allowed the banks to 
raise large sums of money at a very low price. And, as memories of earlier busts faded, the 
margin  that  banks  charged  their  customers  over  those  lower  funding  costs  was  also 
compressed by increased competition.  
Households  and  companies  were  therefore  able  to  borrow  more  money  at  ever  more 
attractive  terms.  Loan  to  income  ratios  crept  up.  And  UK  banks  became  increasingly 
dependent  on  borrowing  from  wholesale  investors  overseas  (Chart  3).  By  the  eve  of  the 
Credit  Crunch  in  2007,  the  balance  sheets  of  the  banks  and  households  and  some 
companies to whom they had lent large sums of money had become stretched.  
All this looked sustainable so long as banks could continue to get access to cheap funds, 
and households and companies could rely on a steady stream of income and profit to service 
debt. But once the music stopped, those leveraged balance sheets were very vulnerable and 
adjusting them is proving very painful. That process is at the heart of the events unfolding 
here in the UK and around the world. 
But the crisis here was not triggered by rising household defaults or corporate failures in the 
UK; in fact they have started to rise only recently. The crisis started in the US housing market 
and spread to the rest of the world through the banking system. And the problems in the US 
were  themselves  a  reflection  of  global  imbalances  in  trade  and  capital  flows  between 
advanced and emerging economies. The rapid growth of exports from Asia, and latterly the 
Gulf, was reflected in a substantial build up of savings which financed a rapid growth of credit 
in the West.  
When  losses  emerged  in  US  sub-prime  market,  they  ricocheted  through  the  international 
financial system, including British banks. Not only did they face losses on their portfolios of 
structured credit but sources of funding on which they had become dependent, particularly 
securitisation, dried up.  
A global economic slowdown 
Initially,  the  impact  of  the  crisis  seemed  to  be  concentrated  in  the  US  and  a  handful  of 
European banks while the emerging economies of Asia continued to boom. With wages and 
prices rising, many of the people I met in India and China this time last year rather welcomed 
the prospect of a fall in Western demand as a means of taking a little of the heat out of their 
own economies. But the picture has changed since then.  
In the UK we have experienced a sharp and broad-based slowdown in activity that gathered 
momentum in the autumn (Chart 4). In part that reflected the concerted credit squeeze that 
started in summer 2007. But we also saw a sharp drop in confidence among consumers and 
companies  after  the  crisis  in  the  banking  system  which  followed  the  decision  to  allow 
Lehman Brothers to fail in September last year. 
A similar drop in confidence has been observed across the world – in China and India as 
much as in the West – and we are now in the throes of a severe and coordinated contraction 
worldwide  (Chart  5).  Even  those  countries  which  sat  out  the  excesses  of  the  credit  boom 
2 
 BIS Review 5/2009
have been affected by the slowdown. Around the globe, sectors like manufacturing which are 
heavily dependent on world trade have been particularly badly hit by the ebb tide of global 
demand. In the United States, the ISM survey of manufacturing activity posted a near thirty 
year  low  in  December.  And  in  Japan,  the  November  fall  in  industrial  production  was  the 
largest  percentage  contraction  on  record.  The  recent  industrial  production  figures  from 
Germany, France and Italy tell a similar story. 
The outlook for the remainder of 2009 
The  immediate  prospects  in  the  UK,  as  elsewhere,  remain  difficult.  Data  on  new  orders 
suggest that output is likely to fall sharply in the first quarter of 2009 as well as in Q4 of last 
year; further declines in output, if not at the same pace, are likely beyond then.  
The  widening  margin  of  spare  capacity  will  act  as  a  significant  drag  on  costs  and  prices. 
Coupled  with  the  deflationary  impact  of  falling  commodity  prices  and  the  cut  in  VAT,  CPI 
inflation  will  continue  falling  over  the  year  and  may  go  well  below  the  target  rate  of  2% 
despite the impact of sterling’s depreciation on import prices. With its inclusion of mortgage 
interest and other housing costs, the change in the RPI is expected to turn negative. 
The downturn itself has set powerful contractionary forces to work.  
Over-indebted  households  and  companies  will  be  pulling back  on  spending  to  try  and  pay 
down those debts. Although the recent falls in commodity prices will help to mitigate some of 
the downward pressure on household income, rising unemployment is not only constraining 
the  spending  of  those  losing  or  not  finding  jobs  but  is  likely  to  boost  precautionary  saving 
across the household sector. And falling property prices are reducing activity in the housing 
market and the construction sector. 
With credit hard to come by, companies will find it difficult to fund new investment projects 
and few companies would be likely to invest large sums of money even if they could raise the 
funds.  Commercial  property  prices  are  still  falling  rapidly.  More  generally,  the  uncertainty 
over the depth and duration of the recession discourages investment and puts cash flow at a 
premium. There is every incentive for companies to batten down the hatches. Unsurprisingly 
then, investment intentions have fallen sharply (Chart 6). 
The stock cycle is also depressing output. Stocks initially rise as sales falter and those stocks 
of inputs, work-in-progress and finished output that companies have become more difficult 
and expensive to finance. But running stocks down involves sharp cuts in production as we 
are seeing in the motor industry.  
All  these  forces  develop  in  any  recession.  The  special  features  of  this  one  are  its  global 
reach,  so  the  contraction  at  home  is  compounded  by  falling  demand  for  exports,  and  the 
severity of the pressures on the banks many of whose survival has been at risk. They too 
face  funding  and  capital  pressures  to  shrink  their  balance  sheets  even  if  it  means  turning 
away good business. Successive credit surveys show not just a reduction in demand but a 
growing constraint on supply. Not only have spreads increased but there is clear evidence of 
quantity  rationing  in  some  markets  which  is  compounding  the  normal  contraction  in 
investment and the squeeze on working capital. 
I should add that that does not mean that all banks have stopped lending. They have not. As 
Chart 7 shows, in the housing market for example there is a clear difference between the 
biggest UK banks and the rest; we saw a big increase in lending especially by foreign banks 
in the years 2006 and 2007; many of them have now withdrawn from the market. On top of 
that, of course Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley have largely ceased new lending. As 
a  result  the  continued  lending  of  the  main  banks  –  and  some  smaller  banks  and  building 
societies – is offset by reductions elsewhere. What matters for the economy as a whole of 
course is the total flow of credit.

the  banking  system  has  been  supported 
The policy challenge 
Nearly all economic policy decisions work with a lag. So there is a limited amount we can do 
at this point to influence the path of output in the first half of this year (although there may be 
ways of mitigating the costs). The main challenge now is to prevent a deep recession being 
unnecessarily prolonged. I want to conclude by making three points about that challenge. 
First, the full impact of the measures of the last few months have yet to be felt. In the UK, the 
Bank has cut interest rates from 5% to 1.5% since October, the government has cut taxes 
and  expanded  spending  and 
through 
recapitalisation  and  improved  access  to  funding  and  liquidity.  These  measures  will  have  a 
growing effect, even if we do nothing more. While the transmission mechanism from official 
interest rates to the economy has been impaired by the dislocation of financial markets, the 
cuts in interest rates are still having an impact. While the reductions in the income of savers 
have offset to some extent the benefits to borrowers in the household sector, the net gain to 
the company sector is clear.  
The changes in interest rates have also accounted in part for the depreciation in the sterling 
exchange rate, which is down around a fifth in the past six months. No one who has lived 
through the 70s, 80s and early 90s will be complacent about a fall in sterling. But there is no 
doubt that an appreciable fall in the pound, such as we have seen, has been helpful both in 
supporting  exports  and  import  substitution  in  the  short  term  and  in  encouraging  the 
rebalancing of the economy that we need in the medium term.  
My  second  point  is  that  it  is  important  to  distinguish  the  medium  term  from  the  short  term 
goals.  In  the  medium  term  we  need  to  see  a  rebalancing  of  the  economy  in  the  UK,  and 
some other countries, with a higher savings rates, less leverage in the financial sector, and 
higher  net  exports.  However  if  everyone  tries  to  increase  saving  and  cut  borrowing 
immediately we could prolong the downturn painfully. If everyone plans for the worst, we are 
more likely to get it. That is why economists sometimes sound a bit like St Augustine who 
famously noted in his confessions “Make me chaste and continent, but not yet”.  
This apparent tension between the medium term and the short term is evident in the banking 
sector. One lesson of the last 18 months has been that in the medium term banks need to 
work with lower leverage and higher buffers of capital and liquidity. I have argued elsewhere 
that we need in future to relate these buffers to the state of the economic and financial cycle 
so  that  they  expand  in  good  times  and  are  sufficient  to  cover  the  inevitable  losses  in  bad 
times. In a sense the purpose of the recapitalisation in October was to put banks capital up to 
the level it should have been had such counter cyclical measures been in place. But, at the 
moment we are in the downswing and we need to allow the banks to use those cushions and 
reduce their capital ratios from the new and higher starting point.  
The third point I want to make is about the breadth of the policy response. Long experience 
has shown that interest rates are the most powerful and effective instrument for managing 
the  economy.  As  a  result  other  regulatory  and  fiscal  measures  have  taken  a  back  seat  in 
macroeconomic management in the last 15 years.  
However  the  distinguishing  feature  of  this  recession  is  that  it  is  centred  on  the  banking 
system, which is at the heart of the allocation of resources through the economy and of the 
transmission  mechanism  for  monetary  policy.  It  is  no  surprise  therefore  that  both  in  this 
country  and  elsewhere  interest  rates  have  been  supplemented  by  measures  that  have 
directly focussed on banking and financial markets.  
Credit is a critical lubricant in a modern economy. It can bridge the gap between expenditure 
and income. It supports investment: allowing households and companies to bring forward the 
purchase of expensive assets, which would otherwise require an extended period of saving. 
And it allows spending to be smoothed in the face of unexpected shocks to income.  
As credit became more scarce, the economy was bound to slow, amplifying the slowdown in 
the  real  economy  that  was  already  in  train.  A feedback loop  started to  gather  momentum.

 BIS Review 5/2009
The  more  the  banks  reined  in  lending,  the  worse  the  economic  outlook  became,  and  the 
greater spectre of rising credit losses on the banks’ loan portfolios, encouraging further cuts 
in lending. 
Policymakers had to intervene to cut this feedback, to prevent funding markets for banks and 
industry from freezing up, and to ensure that the banks have the capital, the funds and the 
confidence to continue lending.  
The measures taken in October were successful in preventing a systemic collapse and in the 
first week of the New Year there were some signs of a more general easing of pressures in 
financial  markets.  However  there  have  been  many  relapses  in  the  last  18  months  and 
yesterday we again saw renewed fears in the markets. 
On the policy side, it is worth remembering that it is possible to overdo the degree of support. 
But  at  present  the  risks  remain  clearly  to  the  down  side.  Therefore,  in  setting  policy,  the 
authorities both here and overseas need to consider whether further action on interest rates 
(or  other  monetary  measures)  or  fiscal  action  is  required.  They  need  also  to  consider 
whether to do more to underpin the confidence among banks and among investors that is 
necessary to support the lending the economy needs to emerge from recession.
