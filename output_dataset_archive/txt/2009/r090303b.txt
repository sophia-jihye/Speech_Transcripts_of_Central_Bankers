Stefan Ingves: Introduction on monetary policy 
Speech by Mr Stefan Ingves, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the Riksdag Committee 
on Finance, Stockholm, 26 February 2009. 
 In  September  last  year  the  global  financial  crisis  gained  a  serious  hold  on  the  Swedish 
financial  markets.  Since  then  the  Riksbank  has  cut  the  repo  rate  by  a  total  of  3.75 
percentage points to 1 per cent – the lowest level since the inflation target came into force in 
1995. 
We have had outstanding loans to the banks of on average around SEK 370 billion since the 
end of September, slightly more than half of which has been loans in US dollars.1 We are 
offering loans at longer maturities than normal. We have extended the types of securities that 
can  be  used  as  collateral  for  loans  in  the  Riksbank.  We  have  provided  special  liquidity 
assistance to two financial institutions; Kaupthing Bank Sverige and Carnegie.  
Since the end of September we have implemented measures that have meant our balance 
sheet total has almost tripled! This sounds rather dramatic. At least in relation to the past 15 
years.  But  managing  our  tasks,  attaining  the  inflation  target  and  safeguarding  financial 
stability,  makes  different  demands  under  different  circumstances.  The  circumstances  in 
recent months have required tools we do not normally need to take out of our toolbox. They 
have also required greater flexibility, speed and force in our actions. 
When I was out ice skating at Norrviken not far from here a couple of weeks ago a metaphor 
came to mind for the way the Riksbank has to adapt to different conditions as they occur. It 
should  be  appropriate  in  this  winter  holiday  period.  Say  that  the  ice  you  are  skating  on  is 
good, but seems to become gradually worse the further you go. Then there is no harm in 
going  a  bit  further  –  waiting  and  seeing  what  happens  –  as  long  as  you  are  observant. 
Perhaps  you  will  change  course  slightly  to  be  on  the  safe  side.  More  than  that  is  not 
necessary. But let us say instead that the ice is suddenly really thin. Then it is no longer a 
good idea to keep on going and wait and see what happens further ahead. A minor change 
of course is not enough. If the conditions become really bad you will have to do even more – 
turn around immediately – to get back onto safe ice.  
What I am trying to say is not that we are skating on thin ice. What I mean is that decisions 
are linked to, and must also be assessed on the basis of the situation in which they are taken 
–  what  information  is  available  and  what  one  believes  lies  ahead.  Like  when  you  are 
wondering whether you should carry on skating on ice that may be uncertain. How much do 
you  need  to  change  course  for  everything  to  go  well?  Like  when  we  Executive  Board 
members take a decision on what interest rate path is needed for inflation to be close to the 
target of 2 per cent a couple of years ahead. How much do we need to change it and how 
quickly?  
Decisions in times of uncertainty and how we manage this is a recurring theme today. You 
members  of  the  Committee  on  Finance  will  later  be  asking  questions  on  the  basis  of  the 
material  for  assessing  monetary  policy  published  by  the  Riksbank  on  16  February.2  Your 
views on our interest rate decisions of recent years – whether you consider they were well-
balanced  given  the  information  at  the  disposal  of  the  Executive  Board  at  the  time  the

decision was made – comprise important information for us. I am therefore looking forward to 
discussing the assessment later, during the actual hearing. But first I would like to talk about 
how  the  financial  crisis  affects  the  conditions  for  our  policy.  I  shall  also  discuss  the  most 
recent  interest  rate  decision  and  our  readiness  for  dealing  with  unexpected  economic 
developments. 
The financial crisis affects the conditions for monetary policy 
For  a  long  time,  the  global  financial  crisis  only  had  a  fairly  limited  effect  on  the  Swedish 
economy.  But  when  the  US  investment  bank  Lehman  Brothers  filed  for  bankruptcy  in 
September the uncertainty over borrowers' credit ratings increased dramatically. Access to 
credit  in  the  financial  markets  around  the  world  declined  and  the  interbank  rates,  that  is, 
interest on loans between banks, rose substantially in Sweden, too. In a couple of days we 
went  from  a  situation  where  Swedish  financial  markets  were  functioning  fairly  well  to  one 
where some sub-markets were in principle at a standstill. We also went from expectations of 
a  fairly  smooth  slowdown  in  economic  activity,  to  significantly  more  gloomy  economic 
prospects.  
I  myself  was  sitting  in  a  meeting  in  Frankfurt  when  I  was  told  over  the  telephone  that  the 
Swedish treasury bill market had been put on hold. This was on 18 September and it was 
now  clear  that  events  had  put  a  spanner  in  our  otherwise  well-oiled  financial  works.  This 
changed the conditions for our policy. Although monetary policy and financial stability have 
always  been  closely  linked,  under  the  circumstances  that have  prevailed  since  September 
one  can  say  that  the  dividing  lines  between  our  two  main  tasks  have  in  many  ways  been 
erased. 
Financial stability affects monetary policy…  
Our most important tool in conducting monetary policy is normally the repo rate. By adjusting 
it we can influence, by means of the banks and the rest of the financial system, the interest 
rates  faced  by  households  and  companies  when  borrowing  money.  In  this  way  we  try  to 
influence  activity  in  the  economy  and  ultimately  inflation.  It  is  therefore  necessary  for  the 
payment  system  and  credit  markets  to  function  so  we  can  carry  out  our  monetary  policy 
tasks efficiently. Financial stability is thus a necessary condition for efficient monetary policy. 
As I have said on an earlier occasion, our task of safeguarding financial stability is in some 
ways  like  taking  care  of  an  electricity  network.  Most  people  give  it  very  little  thought  until 
there  is  a  power  failure.  But  since  last  autumn  one  can  say  that  there  have  been  severe 
disruptions  in  the  network  and  numerous  measures  have  been  required  to  keep  the 
electricity flowing. Although there are some indications that the crisis is not as acute now as it 
was last autumn, many markets would probably not be functioning if the authorities in various 
countries were not regularly taking measures to promote financial stability. 
The effects of the crisis are also still affecting the situation for monetary policy and access to 
credit in the economy. Although the spread between Swedish mortgage rates and risk-free 
securities  such  as  government  bonds  has  declined  since  the  most  intensive  phase  of  the 
crisis, households are for instance still facing slightly higher interest rates than normal if they 
want  to  fix  their  mortgage  rates  at  longer  periods.  The  financial  crisis  may  also  result  in 
declining  access  to  credit.  Many  companies  in  the  Riksbank’s  company  survey  state,  for 
instance, that they are finding it difficult to borrow at longer maturities. The financial crisis has 
also  contributed  to  a  fall  in  equity  and  house  prices.  Lower  wealth,  together  with  the 
widespread  uncertainty  over  future  events,  may  lead  to  companies  and  households 
postponing investment and consumption. All of this affects the activity in the economy and is 
something we must take into account when formulating our policy. Many measures that are 
taken mainly with the aim of safeguarding financial stability at the same time have monetary 
policy  effects.  For  instance,  measures  that  lead  to  greater  confidence  in  the  markets 
contribute to lower interest rates and increased access to credit.

…and monetary policy affects financial stability. 
But inversely, monetary policy also has an effect on financial stability through its influence on 
economic activity. An economic downturn normally leads to unemployment rising and more 
companies going bankrupt. Households and companies find it more difficult to pay interest 
and  amortise  their  loans  and  the  banks  risk  facing  loan  losses.  The  banks  become  more 
cautious,  require  larger  margins  and  collateral  as  compensation  for  lending  money.  This 
reduces the supply of credit, which further reinforces the downturn in economic activity. In 
addition,  it  may  be  the  case  that  the  banks  earn  less  money  from  their  lending  in  such  a 
situation. Lower wealth together with greater uncertainty over future economic developments 
can mean that households and companies neither will nor can borrow as much. To the extent 
that monetary policy measures alleviate the fall in economic activity, they are also beneficial 
to financial stability. 
Measures to create confidence 
The Riksbank and other authorities, both in Sweden and abroad, have regularly injected oil 
into the machinery to ensure that financial markets function more smoothly. To alleviate the 
type  of  effects  I  just  mentioned.  As  I  said  earlier,  in  our  case  it  is  a  question  of  taking 
measures to directly increase the access to loans in SEK and USD, providing the banks with 
loans  at  longer  maturities  and  against  a  broader  spectrum  of  collateral  than  normal.  By 
allowing the banks to borrow against newly-issued commercial paper, we have also tried to 
facilitate the supply of credit to the corporate sector, although interest in these auctions has 
so  far  been  moderate.  As  you  know,  we  have  also  granted  special  liquidity  assistance  to 
Kaupthing  and  Carnegie.  Other  authorities  have  also  taken  significant  measures.  These 
include various market measures taken by the Swedish National Debt Office and the fact that 
the Riksdag and Government have decided on and implemented guarantee programmes and 
changes in the law.  
It is quite simply a question of using various tools that complement one another and together 
help to restore confidence in the markets. In some cases it merely concerns "being there” in 
the  background  in  various  ways.  The  total,  massive  stability  measures  taken  around  the 
world have had an effect. The fact that the spread between interbank rates and treasury bill 
rates with the same maturity has fallen is one example of this. But many ups and downs and 
a lot of work remain before we can declare this crisis officially over. And it is in the light of this 
that we must formulate our monetary policy. 
The  financial  crisis  has  affected  the  conditions  for  our  actions  –  how  we  need  to  work  to 
manage our two main tasks. As long as the conditions require it, we will also take whatever 
measures necessary to safeguard financial stability. When necessary  we will also act with 
greater flexibility, speed and force than usual regarding our monetary policy. The latter also 
affected our most recent interest rate decision and I will now go on to talk about this in more 
detail. 
The most recent interest rate decision 
As I have already mentioned, economic activity has weakened unusually quickly. In addition, 
there is considerable uncertainty regarding economic developments. To dampen the fall in 
production  and  employment,  and  to  manage  the  inflation  target  of  2  per  cent,  our 
assessment was that it was necessary to adjust the interest rate forecast downwards and to 
quickly cut the interest rate at the same time. We therefore decided just over two weeks ago 
to cut the repo rate from 2 per cent to 1 per cent. We are also assuming that the interest rate 
will remain at around the same level over the coming year, with some probability of a further 
cut being necessary. 
But the prospects are brighter further ahead. We are expecting that the measures taken by 
us and other authorities, both in Sweden and abroad, will contribute to the Swedish economy

beginning a recovery next year. We are therefore expecting to begin raising the interest rate 
again towards the end of 2010, and fairly quickly, to just over 3 per cent at the end of our 
forecast period. 
Sharp deterioration in world economic activity…  
The main reason why we cut the repo rate and adjusted the interest rate forecast in this way 
is that economic activity has weakened both in Sweden and abroad – much more than we 
had  expected  in  the  assessment  we  made  in  December.  To  return  to  my  ice  skating 
metaphor – we were once again in a situation where conditions had changed so quickly that 
it was also necessary to change course significantly and at once. 
Households’ and companies’ expectations of future economic prospects are now as low as 
they  were  during  the  crisis  in  the  1990s.  And  since  last  autumn  in  principle  all  types  of 
confidence  indicators  around  the  world  have  fallen  substantially.  Almost  all  statistics  on 
economic  activity  published  since  our  December  assessment  have  been  worse  than 
expected. The situation looks particularly gloomy in the United States and the euro area, but 
prospects  have  deteriorated  more  or  less  around  the  world.  We  have  revised  down  our 
forecasts  for  growth  in  the  world  economy,  and  GDP  in  the  countries  that  are  our  most 
important trading partners is expected to fall by around 2 per cent on average in 2009. 
The  fact  that  the  economic  downturn  has  worsened  so  substantially  is  largely  due  to  the 
global financial crisis. The crisis leads to higher risk premiums and limited access to loans for 
households  and  companies.  It  also  contributes  to  uncertainty  and  to  lower  wealth,  which 
leads  to  a  decline  in  consumption  and  investment.  I  have  mentioned  this  earlier.  The 
uncertainty  regarding  economic  developments  in  the  world  in  the  future  is  also  very 
widespread. 
…naturally affects a small, open economy… 
A small, open economy like the Swedish one is of course very  much affected when world 
economic  activity  slows  down.  The  statistics  received  show,  for  instance,  that  exports  and 
export orders have fallen drastically. The krona has also remained weak, which is something 
that often happens to the currencies of small economies in times of turmoil. A weaker krona 
normally stimulates exports and thus growth. But as demand is also weak abroad, it is not 
certain  that  the  effects  will  be  so  great.  In  addition,  a  weaker  exchange  rate  means  that 
imported goods will be more expensive, which pushes up inflation. But this effect is largely 
counteracted by the expectation that cost pressures and resource utilisation will be lower. 
Labour  market  prospects  have  also  deteriorated.  The  number  of  redundancy  notices  has 
remained as high as it was in the autumn. Our forecast is that unemployment will rise to just 
over 9 per cent during the latter part of 2010. Both the number of persons employed and the 
number of hours worked will fall. Labour productivity has been weak over a long period of 
time; it has even fallen, but in 2009 GDP is expected to grow more quickly than the number 
of  hours  worked.  Productivity  will  thus  increase  again,  albeit  weakly  to  start  with.  We  are 
expecting productivity growth to average at just under 3 per cent in 2010 and 2011. 
…but brighter prospects await after the decline  
The picture I have now painted is certainly not very cheerful. But global growth is expected to 
bottom  out  this  year.  Developments  do  look  brighter  for  most  countries  as  early  as  the 
beginning of 2010. As with all economic downturns, sooner or later there will be an upturn, 
although  it  may  take  time.  It  is  necessary  to  adjust  to  the  new  conditions  and  it  may  take 
some time before households and companies have the confidence to begin consuming and 
investing again. But once the adjustment has come, when consumption and investment have 
picked up, the wheels of the economy will begin to turn more quickly. The stimulation from 
4 
 BIS Review 23/2009
monetary  policy,  fiscal  policy  and  other  measures  around  the  world  will  also  contribute  to 
dampening the decline and speeding up the recovery that is waiting around the corner. 
As I said, growth here at home has weakened rapidly as well. Our assessment is that GDP 
during the final quarter of last year fell by almost 4 per cent on an annual rate, compared with 
the previous quarter. But we are also assuming that economic policy and various measures 
will slow down the fall in Sweden. The weak krona will also provide some assistance. And 
brighter prospects are in sight! We are expecting GDP to show a turnaround at the end of 
2009, although growth will then be fairly modest over the coming two years. But as growth 
abroad increases it will also stimulate the Swedish economy. We are therefore assuming that 
growth will be around 4 per cent at the end of our forecast period. 
However,  the  forecasts  are  of  course  very  uncertain  in  this  situation.  And  there  are 
uncertainty  factors  that  can  push  developments  in  different  directions.  One  of  the 
prerequisites for our forecasts is that the measures taken to improve the functioning of the 
financial  markets  will  have  an  effect.  But  in  a  crisis  that  is  as  closely  linked  to  lack  of 
confidence as this one, the recovery could come very quickly once the distrust is dispelled. 
We assume that our forecast is fairly cautious. Compared with other recessions, the recovery 
predicted for Sweden is fairly slow, although quicker than that following the financial crisis of 
the 1990s. 
Large fluctuations in CPI inflation and the interest rate 
We are expecting fairly large fluctuations in CPI inflation in the coming period. This is largely 
connected to the substantial changes in the repo rate in our forecast. Our inflation target is 
formulated in terms of the change in the CPI, and I would therefore like to pause and develop 
this a little further. 
CPI inflation has fallen rapidly in recent months and we are assuming that this will continue 
during 2009. The annual change in the CPI is expected to be at its lowest in September this 
year, when it will be -1.6 per cent. This fall is largely due to the rapid interest rate cuts we 
have made during the autumn and now in February having an impact on the part of the CPI 
that reflects housing costs. It is also due to the fall in energy prices. 
However, if one disregards the cost of mortgage rates the picture is quite different. Inflation 
measured in terms of the CPIF, which disregards changes in mortgage rates, is around 1.6 
per  cent  on  average  in  2009.  And  if  one  moreover  disregards  the  change  in  energy  costs 
from the CPIF the forecast is even higher. According to our assessment, the CPIF excluding 
energy will increase on average by just over 2.2 per cent a year. 
There are several reasons why underlying inflation trend is being held up. Unit labour costs 
have increased fairly rapidly over the past two years and resource utilisation has been high. 
In addition, the krona has been weaker, which contributes to higher import prices. With effect 
from  2010,  CPI  inflation  will  also  rise,  according  to  our  forecast.  Once  again  interest  rate 
changes have had a powerful impact, but they are now pushing in the opposite direction. In 
2010 we are expecting to raise the repo rate again. Mortgage rates will then cease falling 
and begin to rise instead. At the same time, energy prices will begin to rise slightly. The repo 
rate will then be raised fairly rapidly, from a level of around 1 per cent to around 3 per cent at 
the end of the forecast period. 
The fact that I am now talking about the forecast for the CPIF should not be interpreted to 
mean that we have changed the monetary policy target. Our target is still that CPI inflation 
shall  be  2  per  cent.  But  we  are  also  constantly  studying  a  number  of  other  measures  of 
inflation. In this situation with exceptionally large changes in the repo rate –first down to just 
below one per cent and then rapid increases at the end of the forecast period – it is very 
important to openly and clearly illustrate the direct consequences this can have on the CPI. 
However, in the longer term, beyond the horizon for our forecast, the repo rate is assumed to 
be stable and then the rate of increase in the CPI and the CPIF will coincide. 
BIS Review 23/2009

To summarise – with the most recent interest rate cut and the forecast for the future interest 
rate we are expecting to be able to counteract the restraining effects of the financial crisis on 
the Swedish economy. The economy will gradually return to a more normal situation and the 
Swedish  economy  will  begin  to  recover  next  year.  Resource  utilisation  will  be  lower  than 
normal for the entire forecast period but will rise in 2011. We are assuming that CPI inflation 
adjusted for the effects of changes in mortgage rates will be close to the target of 2 per cent 
at the end of the forecast period. 
Uncertainty but also preparedness for unexpected developments 
It  is  important  to  bear  in  mind  that  economic  prospects  are  unusually  uncertain  at  the 
moment. For example, it may take longer than expected before the financial markets function 
normally  once  again.  It  is  also  possible  that  the  effects  of  the  economic  policy  will  come 
sooner and with greater force than anticipated in our main scenario. The future direction for 
monetary policy will depend, as always, on how new information on economic developments 
abroad and in Sweden will affect the prospects for inflation and economic activity in Sweden. 
The  Riksbank’s  decisions  are  based  on  forecasts  for  a  more  or  less  uncertain  future. 
Unforeseen events in principle occur all the time. This is something we have to live with, no 
matter  how  good  are  forecasts  are.  To  return  to  the  ice  skating  metaphor,  you  may  fall 
through the ice despite being careful. But then you will hopefully have both the equipment 
and  the  training  to  manage  to  get  out  of  the  water  and  get  home  in  dry  extra  clothing. 
Everything may not happen exactly as you have trained for, but you know what to do – you 
have both the tools and the techniques required. 
And  we  do.  We  are  well-prepared  to  manage  our  task,  even  when  there  is  turmoil  in  the 
world around us and when unforeseen events occur. We are aware that extraordinary events 
may require extraordinary measures. If necessary, we can act both quickly and forcefully. If 
necessary,  we  can  implement  more  unconventional  measures  as  a  complement  to  our 
interest rate policy. This is the way we have worked so far, and this is what we will continue 
to do. If necessary! 
Concluding reflections – why are things better this time? 
There  have  been  many  gloomy  headlines  regarding  economic  developments  recently.  We 
are certainly in an economic downturn. And the global financial crisis will probably affect us 
all for some time to come. But, particularly in the light of all of the measures taken and those 
that will be taken around the world, we are expecting economic activity in Sweden to pick up 
again next year. 
After our most recent interest rate decision some analysts wondered why we believe that the 
Swedish economy will recover more quickly now than after the crisis at the beginning of the 
1990s. Let me go back a little way to 18 September last year when the market for treasury 
bills was put on hold. I spoke that day with the Director General of the Swedish National Debt 
Office,  Bo  Lundgren,  with  whom  I  worked  during  my  time  at  the  Swedish  Bank  Support 
Authority in the 1990s. It was not without some feelings of déjà vu. But at the same time I felt 
then – and still feel – confident that a lot of things are different. That is, better! 
Of  course  we  are  an  export-dependent  economy  and  of  course  economic  activity  abroad 
looks worse than it did at the beginning of the 1990s. The effects of the global financial crisis 
contribute  to  considerable  uncertainty  and  also  make  the  situation  very  difficult  to  assess. 
One example of this is the economic downturn and adjustment the Baltic countries still have 
to  work  their  way  through,  something  that  of  course  affects  the  Swedish  banks  with 
operations there. But there is on the other hand a lot in our favour. We do not have a "home-
made” bank crisis now as we did at the beginning of the 1990s. Swedish banks have on the 
whole been much more responsible in granting credit, compared with the lending merry-go-
6 
 BIS Review 23/2009
round that followed the deregulation of the credit markets in the 1980s. We have not entered 
into an economic downturn with an economy that it out of balance, as we did then. Today we 
have  instead  a  surplus  on  the  current  account  and  sound  public  finances  that  provide  a 
different degree of freedom for fiscal policy. Nor do we have a starting situation with nominal 
interest rates in some cases way above 10 per cent as we did then. The current established 
inflation target also provides scope for stimulation from monetary policy. The interest rates in 
the economy are relatively low, despite the crisis, and we are expecting the real repo rate to 
be very low over the coming years. All of this means that things should go better this time. 
There probably remains a lot of hard work before we can leave this financial crisis behind us 
– until we reach a situation where the financial markets are functioning efficiently without the 
aid of government measures, and where uncertainty over future developments has taken on 
more normal proportions. But in addition to the measures aimed at managing the more acute 
stage of the crisis, a number of changes that may provide a more stable, better development 
have begun to take shape around the world. As I said last time I was here – once we have 
closed the accounts on this crisis, we will hopefully have purged the parts that function poorly 
and  replaced  them  with  something  better.  I  am  still  convinced  that  we  will  succeed  in  this 
together!

 BIS Review 23/2009
Unusually great uncertainty in the 
forecasts
(cid:132) The crisis may worsen but …
(cid:132) The recovery may also come sooner
(cid:132) Weaker exchange rate and lower productivity
growth may lead to higher inflation
Extraordinary events may require extraordinary measures…
…but we are prepared!
 Many gloomy headlines, but a turnaround will
come eventually
Why will things go better this time?
(cid:132) Although there are factors that look worse than
in the 1990s
(cid:132) International economic activity
(cid:132) Uncertainty over global financial crisis
(cid:132) There are many more that look better now…
   BIS Review 23/2009

So why will things go better this time?
(cid:132) Not a ” home-made” crisis
(cid:132) Surplus on current account
(cid:132) Sound public finances
(cid:132) Better conditions for both fiscal and monetary
policy 
(cid:132) Lower interest rates to start with
(cid:132) Updated regulations, focus on borrowing and 
capital
