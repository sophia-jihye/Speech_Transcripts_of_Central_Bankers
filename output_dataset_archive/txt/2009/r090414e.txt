Lorenzo Bini Smaghi: On the occasion of the inauguration of the Euro 
Exhibition in Rome 
Speech by Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central 
Bank, at the inauguration of the Euro Exhibition, Rome, 3 April 2009. 
 Dear Fabrizio, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
It is a pleasure for me to be here in these wonderful premises of Banca d’Italia in Rome to 
celebrate with you the occasion of the 10th anniversary of Stage Three of the Economic and 
Monetary Union (EMU) and of the adoption of the euro. We are also here to inaugurate “The 
Euro  Exhibition”,  presenting  the  euro  banknotes  and  coins  through  a  range  of  innovative 
features, which we hope will be appreciated by the public in Rome. 
First 10 years of the euro 
1.  
On 1 January 1999 the Third Stage of EMU began with the irrevocable fixing of the exchange 
rates  of  the  currencies  of  the  11  Member  States  initially  forming  the  euro  area.  Monetary 
authority  for  the  new  currency  was  transferred  to  the  Governing  Council  of  the  European 
Central  Bank.  The  euro  became  the  currency  of  over  300  million  citizens  of  Europe.  The 
number of countries participating in the EMU grew over the years. Today, euro banknotes 
and coins are legal tender in 16 of the 27 Member States of the European Union, and used 
by almost 330 million citizens in the euro area. 
Slovakia has recently become the 16th member of the euro area. Following a two-week dual 
circulation period during which payments could be made using either euro or Slovak koruna, 
the euro became the sole legal tender in Slovakia from 17 January 2009 and the changeover 
was very smooth. Today, the single currency is used in an area that stretches from Cyprus to 
Ireland and from Portugal to Finland. 
As  you  know,  the  euro  cash  did  not  enter  into  circulation  until  1  January  2002,  when  it 
replaced the banknotes and coins of the national currencies like, in the case of Italy, the lira. 
To  support  the  cash  changeover,  which  was  one  of  the  largest  logistical  operations 
undertaken  in  Europe,  extensive  information  campaigns  were  successfully  run  to  acquaint 
citizens with the visual appearance of the euro banknotes and coins. 
The euro is widely recognised as a currency of major significance on the international level. 
Some  12  billion  banknotes  circulate  in  Europe  and  beyond,  representing  a  face  value  of 
more than EUR 700 billion. The number of euro banknotes in circulation continued to grow 
since the initial cash changeover in 2002 and their value has almost tripled since the end of 
the changeover period. 
With this success story in mind, we are confidently looking forward to the anniversaries to 
come, which will be marked by the full consolidation of the euro and its further adoption by 
new member states. 
The Euro Exhibition 
2.  
Today  we  inaugurate  the  Euro  Exhibition  here  in  Rome.  The  exhibition  was  previously  on 
display  to  the  public  in  Bratislava  to  mark  the  cash  changeover  in  Slovakia.  It  was  also 
shown  in  Barcelona  until  last  week.  Other  locations  on  its  journey  throughout  Europe  will 
follow.

The primary objective of the Euro Exhibition is to give the public at large the opportunity to 
gain a thorough overview of the euro banknotes and coins and to raise its awareness of their 
security features. It features, inter alia, modules on the history of money, the design elements 
of  euro  banknotes  and  coins  and  the  functioning  of  banknote  security  features.  It  also 
includes  a  range  of  interactive  elements  to  raise  the  visitors’  attention  via  touch  screen 
applications  such  as  games,  films  or  security  feature  showcases  displaying  counterfeit 
banknotes. 
You are cordially invited to make use of all the elements which will contribute to make your 
visit a learning, interesting and amusing experience at the same time. 
You will certainly notice that the Euro Exhibition features a common design: the “Ages and 
styles of Europe”. As you know, there are windows and doorways depicted on the front of 
each  euro  banknote  and  bridges  on  the  back.  These  architectural  elements  symbolise 
communication and connection between the people of Europe and between Europe and the 
rest of the world. Furthermore, bridges are regarded as a means to connect the past with the 
future, symbolising thus the way to a common European future. 
A children’s corner has been established to meet children’s special expectations. It refers to 
our  children’s  booklet,  specially  drafted  for  primary  students.  To  ensure  that  the  children 
understand and enjoy the story in their mother tongue, the Italian translation of the story was 
tested by the students of the Italian section of the European School in Frankfurt, Germany. 
It is a pleasure for us to present this booklet to you today. The booklet tells an exciting short 
story,  set  against  the  realistic  background  of  a  counterfeit  case  and  explains,  in  an 
appropriate  way  for  children,  how  to  verify  the  authenticity  of  a  euro  banknote.  As  an 
additional  educational  benefit,  its  multilingual  format  can  arouse  the  children’s  interest  in 
other languages. 
The name of this booklet is Anna & Alex take on the banknote forgers. 
After these introductory remarks it is now a pleasure for me to declare this Euro Exhibition 
open. You are kindly invited to come closer to view the exhibition and the children’s booklet.
