 Svein Gjedrem: Management of the Government Pension Fund – Global 
Introductory  statement  by  Mr  Svein  Gjedrem,  Governor  of  Norges  Bank  (Central  Bank  of 
Norway), at the hearing before the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs of 
the Storting (Norwegian parliament), Oslo, 29 April 2009. 
Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. 
 I  would  like  to  thank  the  Committee  for  this  opportunity  to  report  on  Norges  Bank’s 
investment management in connection with the Storting’s deliberations on the Government 
report on the management of the Government Pension Fund – Global in 2008. 
On behalf of the Government, the Ministry of Finance has delegated the responsibility for the 
operational  management  of  the  Government  Pension  Fund  –  Global  to  Norges  Bank.  The 
management mandate is specified in regulations and supplementary guidelines laid down by 
the Ministry. A management agreement has also been entered into. This model promotes a 
clear division of responsibilities, transparency and professionalism. 
Norges  Bank’s  Supervisory  Council  –  appointed  by  the  Storting  –  supervises  the  Bank’s 
activities to ensure compliance with the rules and approves the Bank’s budget and accounts. 
In accordance with the current Norges Bank Act, the Supervisory Council organises the audit 
of  Norges  Bank,  appoints  the  central  bank  auditor  and  lays  down  audit  instructions.  An 
agreement was entered into, following a tender process, with the auditing firm Deloitte AS on 
financial auditing of the Fund with effect from the 2007 accounting year. Deloitte and Central 
bank Audit submit a joint auditor’s report on the annual financial reporting for the Fund. The 
Government  has  submitted  a  draft  bill  recommending  that  the  Supervisory  Council  should 
appoint an external auditor. This would be in line with international developments and best 
practice in this field. 
The  Executive  Board  is  Norges  Bank’s  executive  authority.  The  Executive  Board  has 
increased  its  oversight  of  investment  management  in  recent  years.  In  2006,  an  advisory 
board was set up to support the Executive Board in the field of investment management. The 
board  comprises  four  experts  with  extensive  experience  from  large  funds  and  institutions 
managing equities, fixed income instruments and other assets. 
Previously,  Central  Bank  Audit  was  also  responsible  for  Norges  Bank’s  internal  auditing. 
When Deloitte was made responsible for the financial auditing of the Fund’s accounts, the 
Executive Board’s audit committee and an internal audit unit were also established. The audit 
committee  comprises  three  of  the  Executive  Board’s  external  members.  The  committee 
serves  as  a  preparatory  body  for  the  Executive  Board  on  matters  relating  to  risk 
management and internal control. 
In 2008, the Executive Board issued a new job description and investment mandate for the 
executive director of NBIM. The organisation of NBIM is based on the executive  director’s 
responsibility and authority as general manager of NBIM, which includes reporting directly to 
the Executive Board and regular supervision by the governor of Norges bank on behalf of the 
Executive Board. This virtually eliminates the possibility of one person holding a double role 
as both general manager and as chair of the Executive Board. 
The executive director’s investment mandate sets rules for the Fund’s choice of investments 
and risk limits for NBIM’s investment management. The financial crisis revealed that the risk 
measures  used  previously,  and  which  were  based  on  what  was  regarded  as  best 
international  practice,  were  inadequate.  The  Executive  Board  has  therefore  also  set 
supplementary risk limits, for example for the size of the percentage deviation between the 
actual  portfolio  and  the  benchmark  portfolio,  the  degree  of  leveraging  and  liquidity 
requirements for the Fund’s investments. The mandate is also intended to ensure that active 
BIS Review 53/2009

risk  positions  are  taken  in  a  balanced  manner  and  to  avoid  active  strategies  with  a 
considerably skewed outcome set. 
NBIM’s monthly and quarterly reports to the Executive Board are to reflect the guidelines in 
the investment mandate. 
The  results  for  2008  were  influenced  by  the  global  financial  crisis.  The  total  return  on  the 
Fund was a negative 23 per cent, the weakest in the Fund’s history. There was a negative 
return of 41 per cent on the equity portfolio, while the return on the fixed income portfolio was 
close to zero. The real rate of return after costs has been one per cent since 1998. 
International stock exchanges lost more of their value in 2008 than in any other single year in 
recent history. Absolute results, especially with regard to equities, were highly abnormal. An 
investor  such  as  the  Government  Pension  Fund  –  Global  will  earn  more  in  the  long  term 
because  of  wide  fluctuations  in  equity  values.  Many  investors  have  suffered  losses  on 
equities. As a result of this experience, required returns will be higher in the future. 
Under the Fund’s investment strategy, more equities are purchased when equity prices fall 
and  fewer  when  prices  rise.  Thus,  the  Fund  purchased  a  large  volume  of  equities  in  the 
period 2001-2003 and is buying a considerable volume now. Of the equities now held, 40 per 
cent were acquired in 2008 when prices were falling. The Fund’s average ownership share in 
international  equity  markets  was  ¾  per  cent  at  the  turn  of  the  year,  with  allocations  to 
equities accounting for close to 50 per cent at that time. 
The Fund has a longer investment horizon than the vast majority of other market participants. 
The important question is therefore how sound today’s investments prove to be in the long 
term. 
The government now owns a fair share of the global business sector. This represents real 
value that will provide a return reflecting both global economic growth and the risk related to 
fluctuations in equity prices. 
The  financial  crisis  is  having  a  broad  impact  and  most  forms  of  investment  are  falling  in 
value. State ownership in the Norwegian business sector and its share of subsea petroleum 
reserves on the continental shelf have declined in real value. For large investors, there have 
been  few  places  to  hide  from  the  panic  that  has  gripped  financial  markets.  Prices  for 
government  bonds,  particularly  German  and  US  bonds,  rose  last  year,  but  yields  are  now 
very low and will provide little protection when inflation eventually picks up again. Household 
housing wealth also fell substantially in real value from summer 2007 to end-2008. The same 
probably applies to the value of infrastructure investments. 
The return generated by Norges Bank’s investment management in 2008 was 3.4 per cent 
lower  than  the  benchmark  portfolio  against  which  we  are  measured.  This  is  considerably 
weaker than might have been expected in the light of our investment strategy, which relies 
on a large number of small, independent positions. 
In the period since 1998, the Fund has recorded a cumulative annual excess return of 0.04 
percentage point lower than the return on the benchmark portfolio defined by the Ministry of 
Finance.  Norges  Bank’s  aim  is  to  generate  added  value  through  our  investment  choices. 
After  many  years  of  high  performance,  the  Fund  is  now  right  back  where  it  started.  The 
Fund’s  underperformance  and  the  fall  in  overall  return  can  largely  be  attributed  to  the 
financial crisis. Assessment of the results of our active choices should, in our opinion, also 
take  into  account  the  long-term  perspective  on  which  the  Fund’s  investment  strategy  is 
based. 
Norges Bank’s investment results since 1998 are different for the two asset classes, equities 
and fixed income instruments. 
Although  active  equity  management  generated  negative  results  in  2008,  these  were  well 
within the limits predicted by our risk models for any one year. However, since the beginning 
the  annual  excess  return  on  equities  has  been  close  to  ½  percentage  point.  We  have 
2 
 BIS Review 53/2009
 established  an  equity  management  strategy  that  seems  to  be  fairly  robust  to  market 
fluctuations  and  that  has,  as  we  have  seen,  generated  solid  returns  viewed  over  a  longer 
period. 
Developments in the Fund’s fixed income portfolio have followed a different path. The annual 
return on the actual portfolio was ½ percentage point lower than the return on the benchmark 
portfolio.  
The results were not due to investment in high-risk fixed income instruments. 
At the end of 2008, as much as 64 per cent of the bonds in the Fund’s fixed income portfolio 
had the best credit rating, AAA, 20 per cent had the second best, AA, while ten per cent were 
rated A. Five per cent of bonds were rated BBB, which is the rating the credit rating agency 
Standard & Poor’s has assigned companies such as Telenor and Statkraft. Only one per cent 
of  the  fixed  income  portfolio  has  a  lower  credit  rating.  Realised  losses  as  a  result  of 
bankruptcies have been low. 
The following table provides a static situation report. As the recession follows its course, and 
the credit rating agencies continue to respond positively to criticism, ratings will probably be 
adjusted to a certain extent. The emphasis will nevertheless be on high-quality paper. 
How then can an excess return become negative from one year to the next? 
To explain this, allow me to draw your attention to developments in yields on bonds with a 
BBB rating, i.e. among the less high quality bonds in the Fund’s portfolio. The above chart 
shows  the  pronounced  changes  in  the  difference  in  yield  between  these  bonds  and 
government  bonds,  or  the  credit  spread.  This  does  not  per  se  reflect  a  higher  risk  of 
bankruptcies. If this were the case, perhaps half of these solid companies would have to file 
for bankruptcy in the course of a few years. In this analysis from the Bank of England, risk 
premiums on corporate bonds are instead divided into three components. One component 
takes account of expected losses and another uncertainty with regard to expected losses – in 
other  words,  fear.  The  third  primarily  indicates  that  these  bonds  have  become  illiquid,  or 
more difficult to buy and sell. These liquidity premiums, and perhaps also premiums for the 
initial panic and fear, do not pose a problem for a fund like the Government Pension Fund. 
On the other hand, a prolonged period of fear and liquidity shortages – if the authorities are 
not able to reverse these developments – could lead to higher future losses. 
The  Fund’s  fixed  income  portfolio  is  well  diversified  across  different  types  of  bonds  and 
different regions and the active strategies had low correlation in normal markets. However, 
the  financial  crisis  revealed  that  these  strategies  were  exposed  to  more  underlying, 
systematic  risk.  Correlation  was  not  expected  to  be  high  between  investments  in,  for 
example,  Japanese  inflation-indexed  government  bonds,  bonds  issued  by  international 
organisations  such  as  the  European  Investment  Bank,  European  covered  bonds  and  US 
mortgage-backed bonds. 
These  experiences  and  the  abrupt  turnaround  in  market  liquidity  suggest  that  active 
management of the fixed income portfolio should be limited and measured on the basis of a 
number of criteria, as laid down by Norges Bank’s Executive Board. 
The  Fund  currently  has  extensive  holdings  of  bonds  that  are  difficult  to  trade  in  today’s 
market.  Realised  losses  related  to  these  investments  have,  as  mentioned  above,  been 
limited. The flipside of large book losses is that this portfolio has a high return, reflecting not 
only the increase in credit risk but also high liquidity premiums and fears and uncertainty in 
the market. The return, measured as the difference in the effective interest rate between the 
actual portfolio and the benchmark portfolio, is now close to two percentage points. 
History  has  seen  a  number  of  deep  financial  crises,  and  market  conditions  will  return  to 
normal in time.  
The final results of the management of the Fund’s fixed income portfolio since the beginning 
of the financial crisis cannot be deduced from the quarterly results while the crisis is at its 
BIS Review 53/2009

most intensive. Values are not lost as long as borrowers fulfil their obligations. The Fund is 
prepared to retain ownership of a large volume of bond holdings until they mature in a few 
years.  Moreover,  unless  the  economic  outlook  goes  from  bad  to  considerably  worse,  the 
Fund will record a substantial excess return in the years ahead. 
The Ministry of Finance has set risk limits for Norges Bank’s management of the Fund. This 
limit is defined using a statistical concept – expected tracking error (relative volatility) – which 
puts  a  ceiling  on  how  far  the  Fund’s  actual  investment  portfolio  can  deviate  from  the 
benchmark portfolio. Expected tracking error must not exceed 1.5 percentage points or 150 
basis points. This limit entails an expectation that the gap between the return on the fund and 
the  benchmark  portfolio  will  be  less  than  1.5  percentage  points  in  two  out  of  every  three 
years.  
At the beginning of 2008, the Fund’s expected tracking error was 43 basis points, which is 
slightly higher than the historical average for the fund. Expected tracking error then increased 
gradually through 2008. Towards the end of the year, observations were at the highest levels 
in the history of the fund. At the end of October 2008, expected tracking error exceeded the 
limit set by the Ministry of Finance.  
This relative increase in market risk occurred at a time of wide daily market fluctuations. It 
was  not  the  result  of  new  active  risk  positions.  Although  new  investments  were  of  course 
suspended, there were no fire sales either under the prevailing conditions. Market risk has 
subsequently decreased considerably. 
In conclusion: 
The fund is a long-term savings plan and capable of riding out large swings in the markets. 
This is the very foundation of the investment strategy with its high allocation to equities. Our 
ability to adhere to this strategy in a critical phase – even if this should last some time – is 
crucial if the fund is to deliver the returns we expect in the longer term. 
In 2008 Norges Bank’s management results were weak in both absolute and relative terms. 
Relative returns in 2008 were significantly worse than might have been expected based on 
the investment strategy chosen. In the management of the fixed income portfolio, the crisis in 
the financial system revealed that risk exposure in the various mandates was not sufficiently 
independent.  
The Executive Board has reinforced its oversight of the Bank’s investment management. It 
has  issued  a  new  mandate  to  NBIM  that  delegates  investment  management  responsibility 
and introduces additional limits in the risk profile for investment management. 
As with the fund’s long-term investment strategy, the results of our operational management 
of the fund need to be measured over time. I am confident that the operation we have built 
up will deliver good results in the long term. 
Thank you for your attention!
