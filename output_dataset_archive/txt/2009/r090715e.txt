Ignazio Visco: The global crisis – the role of policies and the 
international monetary system 
Paper  by  Mr  Ignazio  Visco,  Deputy  Director  General  of  the  Bank  of  Italy,  to  the  G20 
Workshop  on  the  Global  Economy  –  Macroeconomic  causes  of  the  crisis:  key  lessons  – 
Session  2:  Did  the  international  monetary  system  contribute  to  the  crisis?,  Mumbai,  24-26 
May 2009. 
While I retain full responsibility for the theses presented in this paper, it owes much to exchanges and joint work 
with  Pietro  Catte,  Pietro  Cova,  Giorgio  Gomel  and  Patrizio  Pagano.  For  a  wider  and  deeper  discussion  of  the 
topic, see Catte et al. (2009). 
 Introduction: A macro view 
1.  
If the outbreak of the financial crisis surprised many economists, this was in part because 
most of them saw the risk of a hard landing for the US economy as originating elsewhere, 
namely  in  the  unsustainable  US  current  account  imbalance,  which  might  have  eventually 
been corrected through a disorderly dollar depreciation. As it turned out, another time bomb, 
located in the financial system and less visible to most observers, exploded first. But does 
this  imply  that  the  fundamental  sources  of  vulnerability  for  the  world  economy  had  been 
wrongly identified? Was the time bomb that did explode entirely unconnected to the one that 
did not? Not only, I think, the answer to both questions is in the negative, but it is worth giving 
proper  consideration  to  the  idea  that  had  the  forces  that  led  to  global  imbalances  been 
removed,  the  financial  turmoil  would  have  had  lesser  global  consequences.  A  proper 
counterfactual  analysis  is  beyond  the  objectives  of  this  short  paper,  but  I  believe  that  the 
evidence presented here clearly supports such proposition. 
Both  the  trigger  of  the  global  financial  turmoil  that  started  in  the  summer  of  2007  and  its 
proximate causes were essentially financial in nature, and originated in a specific segment of 
US  financial  markets.  However,  when  we  look  at  how  the  crisis  spread  rapidly  across 
markets and then progressively affected the real economy, not just in the industrialised world 
but  globally,  it  is  immediately  clear  that  only  a  much  broader  set  of  interrelated  factors  – 
macroeconomic as well as financial – could have generated a crisis of these proportions. 
In attempting to disentangle these factors, one should avoid the temptation to look for simple 
reductionist approach, leading to mono-causal explanations. Distorted incentives, inadequate 
risk  management  and  lax  supervision  encouraged  the  financial  sector  to  take  increasingly 
large,  poorly  understood  risk  exposures,  financed  through  high  leverage  and  a  growing 
reliance  on  wholesale  short-term  funding.  However,  it  is  unlikely  that  all  this  would  have 
developed to the same extent had the macroeconomic environment not been characterised 
by  low  interest  rates,  rising  asset  prices  and  large  saving-investment  imbalances  in  the 
United States and, with opposite sign, in Asia and the oil producing countries. All this was 
reflected in growing worldwide external imbalances; while the role of other areas of the world 
economy should not be ignored, their direct contribution to the imbalances is more difficult to 
assess. These macroeconomic factors created enormous stress for a US and global financial 
system  in  which  financial  innovation  and  regulatory  failures  had  progressively  introduced 
serious  structural  flaws.  Moreover,  the  complacency  on  the  part  of  risk  managers  and 
financial supervisors that allowed the resulting vulnerabilities to grow unchecked owed much 
to the climate of general optimism that those macro conditions supported. 
Out of this complex interaction, in this paper I will focus primarily on the role of policies and 
on how they reacted to the various shocks to the global economy over the past 15-20 years: 
geopolitical  shocks  such  as  the  end  of  the  Cold  War  and  the  emergence  of  terrorism; 
technological shocks like the advent of new information and communications technologies;

economic shocks such as the integration of China in the world trading system and financial 
globalisation.

Macroeconomic policies and regulatory failures combined and reinforced one another. The 
results were visible in a number of macro phenomena: 
• 
The  dramatic  fall  in  US  households’  saving  rate,  from  around  7  percent  in  the 
early  1990s  to  close  to  zero  in  2005-2007.  This  decline  in  the  propensity  to  save 
closely  matches  the  rise  in  household  sector  net  worth  (Figure  1),  pushed  up  by 
successive booms in asset prices. In the 1990s, US households “chose” to reap the 
anticipated  and  real  (“beyond  the  hype”)  –  but  partly  illusory  –  benefits  of  the 
productivity acceleration related to the New Economy, and incorporated in overblown 
equity values, in advance, in the form of current consumption; after 2000, they did the 
same  with  the  rise  in  housing  wealth,  and  financed  their  demand  through  a  large 
increase in indebtedness (Figure 2).

   A very large increase in US and global liquidity (Figure 3). This was largely the 
consequence  of  US  monetary  conditions,  which  were  generally  accommodating 
throughout the 1990s – partly in response to actual or feared shocks to the financial 
sector  (the  Asian  crisis,  LTCM,  the  millennium  bug)  –  and  then  were  eased 
dramatically  and  maintained  expansionary  for  an  unusually  long  period  of  time 
following the bursting of the dot.com bubble in the first half of the current decade. It is 
noteworthy that fiscal conditions also became highly expansionary starting in 2001, 
dramatically reversing the trend of the second half of the 1990s. 
The widening of global imbalances, recognised as unsustainable already in the late 
1990s. Starting in 1991, and with a sharp acceleration around 1996, the US current

account  deficit  worsened  steadily.  Initially  its  main  counterpart  was  surpluses  in 
Europe and Japan, but after 1997 the surpluses expanded mainly in Asia (in China 
since  2001-02)  and  in  the  oil  exporting  countries  (Figure  4).  The  US  international 
investment  position  deteriorated  by  less  than  the  cumulated  deficits  would  imply, 
thanks to favourable valuation effects (Figure 5). But these temporary effects masked 
a clearly unsustainable underlying trend.

   An enormous increase in official reserves (Figure 6). Initially driven by a desire to 
achieve greater resilience against capital outflows in the aftermath of the Asian crisis, 
after 2002 the reserve accumulation grew far beyond any reasonable reserve needs. 
It  was  largely  concentrated  in  emerging  Asia  and  the  oil  exporting  countries,  which 
pegged their currencies to the US dollar or in any case resisted their appreciation.

Very low levels of global long-term interest rates and asset price volatility after 
2003.  Long-term  interest  rates,  which  had  fallen  sharply  after  2000,  remained 
unusually low even after US policy rates started to be gradually raised in mid-2004 
(Figure  7).  After  the  US  economy  came  out  of  the  2001-2002  recession  and  the 
effects  of  a  number  of  other  shocks  subsided  (Enron-like  corporate  scandals; 
September  11  and  the  start  of  the  global  war  on  terror),  credit  risk  spreads  and 
volatility declined to historically low levels in a broad range of markets (Figures 8 and

   A sequence of asset price bubbles, in the United States and globally (Figure 10). 
The dot.com equity bubble of the late 1990s was essentially driven by overoptimistic 
expectations,  but  it  was  also  accommodated  by  monetary  policy.  Then,  after  2000, 
the combination of low interest rates, abundant liquidity and investors’ search for yield 
combined to create extremely easy financial conditions, not only in the United States 
but globally, which supported and financed an unusually synchronised global housing 
price boom; by 2007, equity markets too were again at or above earlier peak levels.

The  combination  of  these  macroeconomic  sources  of  tension  interacted  with  the  financial 
system flaws to build up very significant, although at least partly hidden, financial fragilities, 
which  were  then  fully  revealed  by  the  outbreak  of  the  crisis.  A  major  role  was  played  by 
shortcomings  in  the  assessment  of  risk,  especially,  but  not  only,  on  the  part  of  “large  and 
complex  financial  institutions”;  by  the  difficulty,  if  not  impossibility,  of  valuing  complex  new 
products  of  structured  finance;  by  the  laxity  and  gaps  of  financial  regulation.  The 
consequences  for  the  financial  system  and  our  market  economies  will  certainly  be  very 
substantial  and  long  lasting.  But  the  macroeconomic  policy  framework  and  the  modus 
operandi  of  the  international  monetary  system  that  led  to  the  imbalances  not  only 
exacerbated  the  impact  of  the  financial  flaws  but  in  fact  transformed  the  severe  financial 
turmoil into a fully fledged global economic crisis.  
The role of policies  
2.  
In my view, then, the lack (beyond the declarations and press releases at G7 meetings and 
the  like)  of  sufficiently  decisive  policy  reactions  to  the  external  imbalances  that  began  to 
expand rapidly from the second half of the 1990s was crucial. Essentially these disequilibria 
reflected rapid and sustained growth in final demand, especially consumption demand, in the 
leading  economic  region  of  the  planet,  financed  by  over-borrowing,  primarily  from  abroad. 
Growth, in short, has occurred without savings in the United States and with excess savings

 in  other  major  economies.  If  the  United  States  has  served  as  a  sort  of  “consumer  of  last 
resort,” other large advanced and emerging economies have implicitly or explicitly followed 
an  export-led  growth  strategy,  that  is  difficult  to  maintain  indefinitely  but  also  difficult  to 
abandon.  
The discussion that follows deals chiefly with the inability to respond, in what has come to be 
called the Bretton Woods II system, to the growing external imbalances. While the surplus 
economies, in emerging Asia and elsewhere, have not been able to raise domestic demand, 
a more difficult question concerns the response of the European Union, in particular that of 
the  euro  area.  For  the  latter,  external  positions  on  the  whole  have  been  balanced  all 
throughout  its  existence  (since  1999),  and  monetary  stability  has  been  successfully 
maintained. Economic growth has been relatively modest, however, and catching up to the 
US in per capita income has basically halted. My interpretation is that domestic demand has 
lagged behind not much because of excessive saving but because of limited potential output 
expansion, the result perhaps of slow and timid structural adjustment. Within the area, the 
largest economy’s exceptional reliance on exports is also a fact. 
To  show  that  the  role  of  policies  has  not  been  negligible,  in  what  follows  I  argue  that  (i) 
monetary  policy  in  the  US  was  overly  expansionary  for  too  long,  (ii)  exchange  rates  in 
several emerging market economies have been too rigidly pegged to the US dollar, and (iii) 
asset  price  and  financial  stability  have  not  been  considered  a  responsibility  of  the  central 
bank or at best have been assigned a secondary role. These are not original observations, 
as they have been advanced in various occasions since the late 1990s. However, they have 
not often been considered jointly and have generally played only a limited part in the policy 
debate. With the benefit of hindsight, I would venture to say that they are now recognized as 
most relevant factors in the process that has led to the current global crisis (some relevant 
references are listed at the end of the paper).  
To  emphasize  the  role  of  policies  in  the  onset  of  the  global  recession,  I  believe  that  it  is 
useful to propose a reconstruction of the sequence of events that have marked the last ten to 
fifteen years, condensed in the following six statements:  
• 
Around the mid-1990s, the acceleration of US productivity and the increase in 
household  net  worth  determined  a  first  upward  shift  in  private  sector 
propensities to invest and to consume.  
As the 1990s began, the Cold War was ending. For the previous half-century, America had 
strengthened its defences and built global alliances to contain Soviet communism, an enemy 
that now suddenly ceased to exist. My conjecture is that the peace dividend made possible 
the  sudden  diffusion  of  a  substantial  backlog  of  originally  defence-related  technological 
innovations  (in  materials,  technologies,  general  know-how)  to  the  civilian  economy.  In  any 
case, the revolution in the new information and communication technologies (ICT) definitely 
reversed the trend of productivity in the United States, which returned to markedly high rates 
of growth in the second half of the 1990s. A large fraction of the productivity pick-up in the 
United States was due to the diffusion of ICT, which drove overall output growth both directly 
–  through  the  boost  to  total  factor  productivity  in  the  ICT-producing  industry  itself  –  and 
indirectly, via capital deepening in ICT equipment by other sectors (Figure 11).

 Expectations of high future productivity and income gains were most likely a factor underlying 
the  decline  in  saving  rates,  which  may  be  rationalized  in  terms  of  efficient  consumption 
smoothing:  US  households  were  simply  taking  advantage  of  borrowing  opportunities, 
fostered  by  financial  deregulation,  to  consume  part  of  their  anticipated  future  income  and 
wealth  gains  immediately.  However,  private  agents  probably  overestimated  the  effects  of 
productivity  gains  on  permanent  income  and  profits.  The  transmission  of  the  shock  to 
consumption  and  investment  occurred  to  a  large  extent  via  the  rise  in  equity  prices. 
Reasoning in terms of a standard solved-out consumption function, the observed decline in 
the saving rate is consistent with the hypothesis that consumers perceived the increase in 
wealth  as  permanent.  In  fact,  a  back-of-the-envelope  calculation  shows  that  the  decline  in 
the household sector saving rate (by about 6 percentage points from the end of 1992 to the 
third  quarter  of  1999)  only  slightly  exceeds  what  we  obtain  if  we  apply  the  standard 
propensity  to  consume  out  of  wealth  incorporated  in  most  macroeconometric  models, 
including  the  Fed’s,  to  the  actual  change  in  household  net  worth,  and  compare  it  to  a 
counterfactual where net worth grew only in line with disposable income.  
• 
The US monetary policy stance generally accommodated the hype in the “new 
economy” in the late 1990s; by historical standards it was particularly easy for 
a prolonged period after the turn of the century.  
Following the financial crises that hit the economies of South-East Asia and Russia (1997-
98)  and  the  collapse  of  LTCM  (autumn  1998),  the  Federal  Reserve’s  policy  remained 
essentially accommodating; ample liquidity was also provided to counter the risks of the so-
called  millennium  bug.  While  the  ex  post  fitting  of  a  “Taylor  rule”  (Figure  12)  does  not 
highlight  monetary  conditions  much  easier  than  those  that  would  be  implied  by  a  policy 
responding to output and inflation according to historical standards, it is a fact that they were 
accommodating  what  many  observers  considered  to  be  a  bubble  in  equity  prices.  In  the 
aftermath of the Asian crisis the output gap reversed but monetary conditions still appeared 
to  be  appropriate,  as  a  result  of  inflation  and  inflation  expectations  being  contained  by  a 
number of supply (as well as external) factors and the credibility, at the time, of the monetary 
policy regime. But there was some debate over whether the Fed should have started raising 
10 
 BIS Review 87/2009
rates  before  the  early  months  of  1999.  The  rationale  for  monetary  policy  at  the  time  was 
provided  by  Alan  Greenspan’s  famous  statement  at  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  Kansas 
City  Symposium  in  Jackson  Hole  in  August  1999:  “…  central  banks  do  not  respond  to 
gradually declining asset prices. We do not respond to gradually rising asset prices. We do 
respond  to  sharply  reduced  asset  prices,  which  will  create  a  seizing  up  of  liquidity  in  the 
system. But you almost never have the type of 180-dgree version of the seizing up on the up 
side. If, indeed, such an event occurred, I think that we would respond to it. The actuality is 
that it almost never occurs, so it appears as though we are asymmetric when, indeed, we are 
not.  The  markets  are  asymmetric;  we  are  not”.  In  the  following  months  stock  prices 
skyrocketed, especially on Nasdaq, the Fed’s policy moved to a tighter stance, and monetary 
tightening ended up bursting, late, the dot-com bubble in 2000-01.

The  recessionary  effects  of  this  were  compounded  by  those  of  the  severe  shock  of  the 
September  11  terrorist  attacks.  The  Federal  Reserve’s  response  was  then  very  rapid  and 
very accommodating. The drastic reduction in interest rates was accompanied by a strongly 
expansionary  budgetary  policy,  which  remained  in  place  also  in  relation  to  the  military 
operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Monetary policy remained expansionary for a protracted 
period, facilitating a return to sustained growth in household consumption, not countering the 
trend towards a zero saving rate. It also gave free rein to financial innovation, in conditions of 
abundant liquidity, especially with the repackaging in 2004-06 of mortgages − in a context of 
constantly  rising  house  prices  −  into  structured  products  that  opened  up  new  investment 
possibilities to banks. 
The gap relative to historical standards, summarized in the Taylor rule, became very wide 
and durable. A crucial element motivating this policy was the “deflation scare” of 2002-03, 
when the Fed became highly concerned that monetary policy risked becoming ineffective in a 
low-inflation environment. With hindsight, it can be argued that in that period, thanks to the 
credit and housing channel, US monetary policy had become more powerful than before and 
that, therefore, the federal funds rate was kept too low for too long. This conclusion would 
BIS Review 87/2009

apply a fortiori to the extent that policy should have reacted to rising equity and house prices 
and to the associated risks to financial stability, given that these were not adequately being 
offset by regulatory policies and macro-prudential supervision. 
• 
As the hype in the “new economy” and the expansionary monetary (and fiscal) 
stance  sustained  US  domestic  demand,  they  contributed  to  an  unsustainable 
widening of the external imbalance, compensated by an imbalance of opposite 
sign  that  progressively  grew  in  the  external  positions  of  major  emerging 
economies. 
The  US  current  account  deficit  deteriorated  from  around  2  percent  of  GDP  in  mid-1996  − 
close to its historical average over the previous twenty years − to almost 6 percent in 2006. 
For a while in the 1990s the expansion of private sector consumption and investment driven 
by the “new economy” euphoria was partly offset by a tighter budgetary policy, so the effects 
on  domestic  balance  (overheating)  and  external  balance  (current  account  deficit)  were 
relatively  contained  (Figure  13).  On  the  other  hand,  while  fiscal  policy  turned  very 
expansionary after 2000, it largely offset the sharp increase in corporate net saving as the 
investment  boom  ended.  Households,  which  had  already  turned  net  borrowers  in  the  late 
1990s, ran increasingly larger saving deficits as the housing boom got under way.

The  powerful  expansion  in  US  final  demand  and  imports  supported  the  increasingly  rapid 
growth of exports and output for the major emerging economies such as China and India, 
which  had  previously  lagged  behind.  The  growing  US  current  account  deficit  was 
accompanied  by  ever-larger  surpluses  in  emerging  economies  and  in  Japan,  with  a 
significant build-up of official reserves, in a context of relatively sluggish growth in domestic 
demand  and,  in  China,  saving  rates  higher  even  than  the  exceptional  rates  of  fixed 
investment  (Figure  14).  The  oil-producing  countries  also  recorded  sharply  higher  trade 
surpluses, reflecting the rise in oil prices due to the expansion of global demand.

The unsustainability of these growing current account imbalances was already an issue in 
the  late  1990s;  afterwards,  only  a  succession  of  positive  variations  in  the  value  of  net 
external financial assets contained the otherwise explosive deterioration of the US net debtor 
position. 
• 
A  number  of  countries  that  pegged  their  currencies  to  the  US  dollar 
accumulated very substantial official reserves. The investment of these in US 
Treasury paper contributed to lower long-term interest rates.  
The financing of the growing US current account deficit did not pose particular problems. Up 
to  2000  private  capital  flowed  to  the  United  States  as  returns  on  financial  assets  were 
perceived  as  being  higher  than  in  other  advanced  countries,  due  also  to  faster  economic 
growth. As a result, a self-reinforcing effect set in. The capital inflows to the United States 
boosted  asset  prices  and  returns,  thus  stimulating  additional  flows  of  capital.  After  the 
bursting  of  the  dot.com  bubble,  inflows  of  private  capital  diminished  substantially, but  they 
were replaced by official flows, coming from countries with limited exchange rate flexibility. 
The  less-than-complete  substitution  led  to  a  depreciation  of  the  US  dollar  and  of  the 
currencies pegged to it.  
The  accumulation  of  official  reserves  accelerated  as  China  and  other  emerging  countries 
kept  pegging  their  exchange  rates  to  the  dollar:  of  the  total  increase  in  foreign  exchange 
reserves between 1998 and 2007 almost 70 percent is to be ascribed to emerging Asian and 
oil/exporting economies. The large volume of investment in US Treasury securities by foreign 
official investors contributed to drive their yields lower. The consensus view seems to be that 
the  effect  of  foreign  flows  was  to  lower  long-term  US  rates  by  slightly  less  than  one 
percentage  point.  Much  of  the  fall  in  yields  seems  to  have  reflected  a  narrowing  of  term 
spreads: long rates declined significantly more than the expected future profile of short rates 
(Figure 15).

 Low  interest  rates  triggered  a  search  for  yield  which,  by  squeezing  risk 
premiums,  tended  to  make  financial  conditions  even  more  favourable  for  a 
broad  range  of  borrowers.  Low  perceived  risk,  abundant  liquidity  and  credit 
expansion,  as  well  as  regulatory  failures  in  some  markets,  helped  feed  the 
house price bubble. 
Ex-ante real interest rates on 10-year US government bonds fell below 2 percent in 2002, 
and remained there for several years. One of the consequences was an increasing search by 
investors − including international banks, banks of other countries and financial vehicles they 
controlled  –  for  investments  with  higher  risk-return  profiles.  This  stimulated  the  supply  of 
structured financial instruments backed mainly, although not exclusively, by home mortgages 
granted with loan-to-value ratios even exceeding 100 per cent, based on the false premise 
that house prices could only increase. In this context, a crucial role was played by financial 
regulation that was generally lax, and, in some market segments, non-existent. 
In this environment, housing finance became cheap and attractive, especially variable rate 
mortgages,  and  even  more  so  those  with  teasers.  For  30-year  fixed-rate  conventional 
mortgages, rates declined to just above 5 percent in June 2003, with almost 3 percent annual 
inflation.  Housing  starts  jumped  by  the  end  of  2003  and  the  surge  in  housing  demand 
spurred  housing  prices.  The  increased  ability  of  households  to  borrow  against  their  home 
equity was crucial in igniting the spiralling of housing demand and prices.  
The global housing price rise started in the late 1990s and gradually accelerated after 2000, 
despite the turn in the economic cycle, supported by lower interest rates. Between 1996 and 
2007 real house prices in the OECD area approximately doubled. Although the extent of the 
increase  differed  considerably  across  countries,  and  a  few,  such  as  Japan  and  Germany 
were  left  out  for  particular  reasons  (respectively,  the  earlier  experience  of  an  extremely 
severe boom-bust cycle and the consequences of the reunification process), the cycle was 
remarkably  synchronised  for  an  asset  market  that  is  inherently  local.  The  last  part  of  the 
house  price  upswing  coincided  with  a  new  run-up  in  equity  prices;  in  advanced  countries 
overall market indexes reached levels close to the 2000 peaks in real terms, and in emerging 
economies exceeded them by far. 
• 
Eventually, global supply reached bottlenecks in the form of commodity supply 
constraints,  US  monetary  policy  was  gradually  tightened,  and  house  prices 
peaked.  At  that  point,  the  large  risk  exposures  that  had  accumulated  in  the 
financial system suddenly became apparent, precipitating the turmoil.  
The strong expansion of global demand was accompanied by a rapid increase in the demand 
for  energy  and  other  commodities,  particularly  in  high-growth  emerging  economies.  Over 
time, this added to inflationary pressures, and monetary policy in the advanced economies 
was gradually tightened. By late 2006 the rise in US interest rates had induced first a loss of 
momentum and then a turnaround in house prices. This triggered a domino effect, starting 
with the structured products based on subprime mortgages. 
In the summer of 2007 the world economy entered a period of acute financial turmoil, which, 
despite  central  banks’  prompt  and  massive  response,  gradually  turned  into  a  global  crisis 
affecting whole industries and economies. The earlier rise in leverage and the various kinds 
of  pro-cyclicality  that  characterise  the  behaviour  of  financial  systems  amplified  the  rush 
toward de-leveraging and exacerbated the resulting credit crunch.  
At the root, however, remain the macroeconomic imbalances that the policies conducted by 
the systemically important countries had allowed to build up unchecked. The importance of 
those imbalances, which transformed what could probably have been a manageable episode 
of financial turmoil into a fully-fledged global economic crisis is evident in the short-lived myth 
of “decoupling” and the subsequent abrupt plunge in world trade in the last quarter of 2008. 
The  consequences  of  the  crash  in  the  US  housing  and  credit  markets  and  the  ensuing 
recession  inevitably  spilled  over  to  the  global  economy:  now  that  the  United  States  has 
BIS Review 87/2009 
 15
stopped  being  the  consumer  of  last  resort  the  whole  world  suffers  a  lack  of  aggregate 
demand  exactly  because  of  the  unbalanced  consumption  patterns.  Emerging  economies 
have experienced both a dramatic decline in demand due to falling world trade and a sudden 
stop in capital inflows due to heightened risk aversion.  
In  some  sense,  this  constitutes  precisely  the  disorderly  adjustment  that  a  number  of 
observers had been fearing since the manifestation of the global imbalances.  
3.  
Interpretations: the “global savings glut”, “Bretton Woods II”, and the “global 
asset shortage” 
Several explanations for the widening of current account imbalances have been suggested. 
The main strands of this broad literature put some of the mechanisms mentioned above at 
the centre of the analysis. Namely: (a) the emergence of excess saving outside the United 
States  (global  savings  glut);  (b)  the  pegging  of  exchange  rates  to  the  US  dollar,  in  many 
cases  at  undervalued  levels  (Bretton  Woods  II);  (c)  the  investment  of  the  accumulated 
reserves mainly in US Treasury securities (global asset shortage). 
Overall, these approaches focus only on some aspects of the narrative that I have sketched 
out.  More  fundamentally,  to  my  mind,  they  downplay  macroeconomic  policies  in  the  core 
country and their role in the emergence of bubbles in real and financial assets.  
The first branch of this literature moves from the reaction of emerging Asian countries to the 
1997-98  crisis.  The  sudden  stop  in  capital  flows  and  the  sharp  recession  forced  Asian 
countries  hit  by  the  crisis  to  reduce  their  external  deficits.  Moreover,  the  crisis  induced 
countries to assign a high priority to the accumulation of large official reserves, as a buffer 
against possible capital outflows. The rapid improvement of their current account positions 
was  also  helped  by  sharp  currency  depreciations.  In  several  of  these  countries  the 
counterpart  was  a  sharp  drop  in  investment.  In  China,  however,  which  had  escaped  a 
currency crisis, there was an exceptional increase in saving after 2002. The formation outside 
the US of what came to be alternatively termed a “saving glut” and an “investment drought” is 
seen as consistent with the observation that, approximately in the same years, real long term 
interest  rates  at  the  global  level  declined  to  historically  low  levels  and  current  account 
imbalances widened dramatically.  
Overall,  the  “excess  saving”  approach  does  not  explain  why  emerging  countries  would 
channel  their  additional  savings  into  building  up  portfolios  biased  towards  a  few  assets 
(mainly US Treasury paper). This is made explicit in the “Bretton Woods II” analysis, which 
emphasises  the  deliberate  maintenance  of  undervalued  exchange  rates  pegged  to  the  US 
dollar  as  part  of  an  export-led  growth  strategy.  This  second  strand  of  literature  too  moves 
from the behaviour of a number of emerging countries (not only in Asia) in the aftermath of 
the  Asian  crisis,  but  focuses  primarily  on  the  excessive  build-up  of  foreign  exchange 
reserves. In addition to the emerging economies’ needs to insure against the risk of capital 
account  crises,  some  other  possible  explanations  of  the  rapid  reserve  accumulation  have 
also been mentioned, such as the need to provide investors from advanced economies with 
some kind of “collateral” against large foreign direct investment or, alternatively, deliberate 
“mercantilistic”  policy  strategies  aimed  at  promoting  an  export-led  development  model 
hinging on price competitiveness.  
An alternative interpretation of the accumulation of reserve assets by emerging economies is 
provided by a more recent strand of the literature, which focuses on financial globalization, 
viewed  as  an  ongoing  endogenous  process  of  integration  between  countries  at  different 
stages  of  financial  development.  According  to  this  view,  the  United  States  commands  an 
unrivalled comparative advantage on a global scale in terms of financial market deepness, 
liquidity and legal infrastructure, and is positioned at the financial core of a rapidly integrating 
world, while high-growth industrialising economies lack the capability to produce the financial 
assets  necessary  to  safely  store  wealth  and  fully  reap  their  growth  dividends.  Excess 
16 
 BIS Review 87/2009
demand for high-quality assets in the periphery translates into a global shortage of assets 
that pushes the core country, the United States, into a structural equilibrium characterised by 
persistent current account deficits and low long-term real interest rates.  
In this story it is not clear, however, what the role of institutional relative to private demand 
for assets is. Financial repression could explain a demand for investment abroad on the part 
of private agents, but in practice the role of private capital flows towards the United States 
diminished  sharply  after  the  bursting  of  the  dot.com  bubble,  and  was  replaced  by  official 
flows. To reconcile the theory with this fact one would have to interpret the official reserve 
build-up by China and others as being conducted on behalf of private agents. 
In all these approaches the roots of the current account imbalances lie outside the United 
States. The focus is on an increasing role of developing countries in providing financing to 
the  United  States,  although  these  analyses  differ  with  respect  to  the  issue  of  the 
sustainability  of  current  account  imbalances.  In  the  global saving  glut story  the  root  lies  in 
specific structural distortions in emerging countries that lead them to “save too much” or to 
“invest too little”. The adjustment of the imbalances thus crucially depends on the correction 
of  such  distortions,  presumably  also  via  greater  exchange  rate  flexibility  in  emerging 
economies. The Bretton Woods II story, on the other hand, focuses more on deliberate policy 
choices  in  these  countries.  Implicitly,  it  is  assumed  that  those  policy  choices  will  be 
corrected, smoothly, in due time. In the meantime, the US net foreign position would continue 
to deteriorate, but this is seen as sustainable. Therefore, in both cases, no specific action to 
correct  the  imbalances  is  necessary  on  the  part  of  advanced  countries.  Finally,  a  stark 
corollary of the global assets shortage story is that, as long as the forces underlying excess 
saving in the periphery persist and the United States retains its undisputed global financial 
leadership, (welfare-enhancing) global imbalances should be the norm. 
None of these stories, by itself, can account for the build-up of financial fragilities, which were 
then fully revealed by the outbreak of the crisis. To this end, as I noted earlier, the role of 
macroeconomic policies appears essential. 
Policy frameworks 
4.  
Two central elements of the story I have sketched out are: (a) an overly expansionary US 
monetary  policy,  which  permitted  a  long  expansion  of  consumer  spending  financed  by 
growing  indebtedness;  (b)  the  choice  by  China  and  other  emerging  countries  to  follow  an 
export-led growth strategy supported by pegging currency to the US dollar, resulting in the 
accumulation of large official reserves.  
Both  policies  were  attractive  in  the  short  run,  but  ultimately  unsustainable  in  the  long  run. 
This is now clear in retrospect, but even without the benefit of hindsight several signals – the 
sharp  decline  in  the  US  household  saving  rate;  the  widening  global  imbalances  and  the 
accumulation of huge official reserves; the enduringly low levels of long-term interest rates 
and  risk  premiums  and  implied  volatility;  the  continuous  expansion  in  global  credit;  the 
succession of booms in financial and real asset prices – should have alerted policymakers 
that those policies were feeding a set of disequilibria that could not be sustained indefinitely, 
but whose correction was nowhere in sight. 
The  question  that  should  be  addressed  is  not  so  much  why  those  unsustainable  policies 
were undertaken in the first place – in a world of imperfect knowledge, private agents and 
policymakers make mistakes all the time – but what allowed them to be maintained for such 
a long time. To address this question, we need to reconsider the conceptual setups that were 
used to frame and to assess the results of those two policy choices. In addition, we must look 
to the international monetary system as a whole, and ask why the incentives incorporated in 
it did not effectively induce the correction of the imbalances and promote policies conducive 
to the orderly functioning of the world economy.  
BIS Review 87/2009 
 17
Monetary policy 
4.1 
It has been argued – in my view, convincingly – that as a result of the success achieved by 
macro-stabilisation  policies  and  of  structural  changes  in  the  responsiveness  of  aggregate 
supply  (also  as  a  result  of  globalisation),  inflation  expectations  are  now  much  better 
anchored,  and  episodes  of  excess  creation  of  liquidity  and  credit  tend  to  be  reflected 
primarily in asset price bubbles, rather than in increased consumer price inflation.  
The  task  of  monetary  policy  in  this  context  is  not  necessarily  easier.  Because  asset  price 
cycles  tend  to  be  associated  with  large  changes  in  indebtedness  and  add  to  financial 
vulnerabilities, they can pose significant risks to financial stability. This brings us to the time-
honoured  question  of  whether  and  how  monetary  policy  should  react  to  asset  price 
misalignments  and  financial  imbalances,  or  more  generally  whether  central  banks  must 
(flexibly) target, with just a single policy instrument, more than just consumer price inflation. 
It has been suggested that to take into account the effects of asset price movements in the 
context of a flexible inflation-targeting framework central banks may need to look further into 
the future than is usual. This might work in “normal” times. However, since the precision of 
forecasts can only decline as we move to more distant time horizons, it is debatable whether 
trade-offs that depend on forecasts of the distant future and are by their very nature rather 
uncertain  can  be  stable  enough  to  provide  reliable  guidance  for  current  policy  decisions. 
Furthermore, one may ask whether this may be too general a framework to provide actual 
guidance  to  monetary  policy.  If  allowed  to  develop,  asset  price  bubbles  and  the  financial 
instability  that  usually  accompanies  them  can  eventually  destabilise  expectations  about 
future  monetary  policy  and  inflation,  especially  if  authorities  follow  a  practice  of  always 
intervening to “clean up” after the bubble has burst, easing policy by as much as is required 
to offset the effects on the economy. 
Here the crucial point is that the models we use to interpret economic data and to set policy 
are particularly lacking in the treatment of asset prices. In this respect: 
• 
We probably do not know enough about the effects of asset price misalignments and 
related  imbalances  in  equity,  real  estate  and  currency  markets,  as  well  as  in  bank 
credit and government debt. These effects are normally found to be relatively small, 
and  asset  price  movements  to  play  a  relatively  limited  role  in  the  transmission  of 
monetary  policy.  Even  if  “extreme  events”  materialised  in  powerful  fashion,  in 
econometric  estimates  they  are  likely  to  be  dominated  over  the  sample  by  “normal 
time” observations and frequently end up being “dummied out”. 
Many of the effects associated with asset price imbalances are, anyway, likely to be 
highly non-linear and complex. The implicit monetary policy reaction function would 
also then be non-linear and complex, and incorporate the effects of asset prices and 
financial  imbalances.  But  for  the  reasons  previously  advanced,  the  models  we  use 
tend  to  be  essentially  linear  and  we  often  lack  the  skills,  and  the  memory,  to 
supplement them with well reasoned analysis and robust evidence. 
 Summing up, the difficult question of how much restriction would be needed in the face of 
rising  asset  prices  calls  for  more  study  and  experimentation.  But,  as  it  has  been  aptly 
suggested, it hardly calls for “benign neglect”. 
The international monetary system 
4.2  
A key element that allowed the US monetary expansion and China’s exchange rate pegging 
to be maintained for so long was the fact that they were mutually reinforcing. In a nutshell, 
demand from US consumers helped sustain China’s (and others countries’) export growth. At 
the same time, an elastic supply of cheap imports from Asia helped keep inflation low in the 
United States (and also, by the way, in the other advanced countries), encouraging the Fed 
to  maintain  an  easy  monetary  stance.  And  the  investment  of  emerging  economies’  official 
18 
 BIS Review 87/2009
reserves in US Treasuries contributed to compress long-term yields both in the United States 
and globally. All this fed global liquidity and rising asset prices. 
The  countries  that  pegged  their  currencies  to  the  dollar  effectively  imported  US  monetary 
policy regardless of whether it was appropriate for domestic conditions. This fuelled liquidity 
and credit expansion, also because of difficulties in sterilizing the effects of the accumulation 
of official reserves, and tended to feed booms in domestic asset prices and investment. But 
the  high  growth  experienced  by  these  countries  effectively  rested  on  the  ultimate  support 
coming from US consumers. This became evident most recently: when it was clear that the 
financial  crisis  might  involve  a  massive  credit  crunch  and  would  require  a  protracted 
rebalancing  on  the  part  of  US  households,  the  fall  in  demand  and  world  trade  was  highly 
synchronised in all advanced and emerging economies.  
Other  surplus  countries  also  had  a  responsibility  in  allowing  the  imbalances  to  grow.  In 
Japan, long delays in facing up to the structural problems of the financial sector caused a 
prolonged stagnation of demand. Germany, and other European countries, introduced some 
structural reforms to the labour market in recent years, but these, in the absence of equally 
forceful reforms in product markets, have largely translated into stagnating wages and weak 
domestic demand. 
The  fact  that  imbalances  that  were  not  sustainable  persisted  for  so  long  shows  that  no 
mechanism – market-based or activated by multilateral surveillance – operated effectively to 
induce  a  correction.  Two  closely  connected  features  of  the  international  monetary  system 
seem to have effectively switched off market-based alarm bells: 
• 
First,  by  pegging  their  currencies  to  the  US  dollar,  surplus  countries  managed  to 
avoid pressure to adjust.  
Second, the role of the US dollar as the international reserve currency implied that 
the  United  States  could  finance  persistent  current  account  deficits  without  coming 
under market pressure, as long as the surplus countries were willing to accumulate 
dollar assets. For the United States, an added benefit of financing deficits in its own 
currency  was  that  dollar  depreciations  generated  favourable  valuation  gains  on  its 
international investment position. 
 Although it is clear that the international monetary system has not been performing some of 
its essential functions, it is by no means clear what could replace it. If the key source of its 
shortcomings is the dollar standard, it is difficult at this stage to identify a realistic alternative. 
All  those  that  have  been  mentioned  –  a  supranational  currency  like  the  SDR;  a  tripolar 
system  based  on  the  dollar,  the  euro  and  an  Asian  currency  –  face  very  substantial 
difficulties. Whatever the final goal, the establishment of an SDR-denominated substitution 
account for existing stocks of official reserves, as recently suggested, may be worth of further 
consideration as a means to smooth the transition. 
In this context it may be instructive to recall how we got here. The original Bretton Woods 
system,  as  designed  by  its  founders,  rested  on  tight  capital  account  controls.  The  gradual 
liberalisation of capital movements helped to exacerbate the tensions within the system, but 
their  roots  were  deeper.  While  the  system  had  been  designed  as  a  regime  of  “fixed  but 
adjustable”  parities,  in  actual  practice  the  peripheral  countries  –  both  those  in  deficit  and 
those in surplus – resisted parity realignments, making the system much more rigid. Surplus 
countries  (Germany  and  Japan)  wanted  to  support  export-led  growth,  while  the  United 
Kingdom  and  France  were  motivated  by  a  desire  to  shore  up  the  reputation  of  their 
currencies to preserve what was left of their international role. All this could be sustained as 
long as the pivot country, the United States, was willing to play the n-th country – that is, to 
accommodate  the  sum  of  ex-ante  external  surpluses  and  deficits  desired  by  the  other  n-1 
countries  –  and  followed  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  that  were  broadly  in  line  with  global 
price stability. This unstable equilibrium became increasingly untenable in the late 1960s and 
early  1970s,  when  the  United  States  –  then  in  the  midst  of  the  Vietnam  war  –  chose  to 
BIS Review 87/2009

pursue  expansionary  policies  disregarding  their  potential  inflationary  consequences  on  the 
global economy.  
There  are  some  evident  parallels  between  this  story  and  the  weaknesses  of  the  current 
functioning  of  the  international  monetary  system.  Again  today,  the  ultimate  source  of 
weakness may be seen as a combination of (a) overly expansionary policies in the centre 
country that contributed to a massive widening of its external imbalance, and (b) the refusal 
of  peripheral  countries  to  allow  exchange  rates  to  move  enough  to  correct  their  surplus 
positions. Another interesting parallel between the two periods is the fact that both the early 
1970s  and  the  last  few years  were  characterised  by  a  very  pronounced  and  synchronised 
commodity price cycle, a clear symptom of global inflationary pressures. 
Underlying all this is the fact that the international monetary system that emerged after the 
demise of Bretton Woods is a non-system, driven by the revealed exchange rate preferences 
of the individual countries, with a very weak multilateral surveillance, despite recent attempts 
to strengthen it. This non-system has never satisfactorily addressed the difficulties connected 
to the “inconsistent triad” of full capital mobility, fixed exchange rates and the autonomy of 
national monetary policies. The regime of fixed exchange rate pegs was never replaced by 
one  of  generalised  free  floating,  even  though  the  degree  of  capital  mobility  continued  to 
increase, but instead gave way to a hybrid system, comprising a great variety of exchange 
rate arrangements. In practice, throughout the last 35 years, the exchange rate policies of a 
majority  of  countries  have  been  marked  by  widespread  “fear  of  floating”,  leading  to  large 
foreign exchange intervention. This fear is not at all surprising: in a world that is increasingly 
integrated  economically  and  financially,  large  exchange  rate  fluctuations  driven  by  capital 
flows can be highly disruptive both to foreign trade and to domestic macroeconomic stability; 
this, after all, is part of the reason behind Europe’s move to monetary union. 
Open questions 
5.  
Whatever the shape of the future system, an urgent task – one to address as soon as the 
economic situation improves – is correcting existing imbalances. 
The fundamental macroeconomic imbalances that lay at the root of the financial crisis are not 
being righted by the consequent global recession. At present, the rise in US private sector 
saving and the sharp fall in investment, partly offset by a larger public sector deficit, appear 
to have narrowed the US current account deficit from 5.3% of GDP in 2007 to 2.8% in 2009-
2010,  as  projected  by  the  IMF.  However,  most  of  the  reduction  is  due  to  cyclical,  not 
structural,  factors;  and  the  effect  of  lower  oil  prices  should  itself  be  seen  as  essentially 
cyclical.  
What happens as the world economy comes out of the recession depends largely on what 
drives the recovery: if it is an expansion of demand in the surplus countries – including not 
only emerging Asia, but also Japan and some European countries – some real correction of 
imbalances is possible; but if the world again relies on US consumers as the primary source 
of demand growth, then imbalances will widen once more. But this calls for potential output in 
those countries to grow enough to allow for such higher growth in domestic demand, in order 
not to jeopardize price stability. And this will clearly be a substantial challenge. 
In any case, if we are to achieve a major rebalancing of world demand, exchange rates will 
probably  have  to  move  as  well.  But  do  we  have,  at  present,  an  effective  mechanism  to 
engineer an orderly depreciation of the US dollar against the currencies of surplus countries? 
So far, since the beginning of the financial turmoil exchange rates have not generally been 
moving in a direction that favours the correction of imbalances. The dollar has appreciated by 
13 percent in effective terms since July 2008 (Figure 16), as the turmoil engendered demand 
for dollar liquidity and large capital flows out of emerging markets have been seeking a safe 
haven  in  US  Treasury  securities.  Those  flows  may  well  be  reversed  as  investors’  flight  to 
20

safety abates and the financial situation normalises. This could trigger disorderly exchange 
rate movements.

Note : increases signal appreciation.
  
This scenario poses a very difficult challenge to the countries that have accumulated large 
quantities of official reserves, predominantly in US dollars. However, continuing to peg their 
currencies  will  only  postpone  the  day  of  reckoning,  while  increasing  the  potential  capital 
losses. This dilemma is exacerbated by the fact that no country can act in isolation, as the 
present and potential effects on trade flows obviously need to be taken into consideration. 
Indeed,  this  is  a  classic  case  in  which  collective  action,  if  feasible,  would  be  welfare-
improving.  It  might  take  the  form  of  a  cooperative  agreement  among  surplus  countries  for 
some kind of joint “managed currency appreciation” vis-à-vis the dollar. The appreciation and 
the  boost  to  domestic  demand  would  have  to  be  large  enough  to  ensure  a  significant 
correction of imbalances.  
But  is  such  collective  action  feasible?  Several  practical  problems  would  need  to  be 
overcome. Even confining the discussion to Asia, the countries that would have to take part 
in it differ in many ways: current exchange rate regimes (hard peg, crawling peg, managed 
floating);  degree  of  capital  account  liberalisation;  stage  of  financial  development;  trade 
specialisation  and  position  in  the  vertically  integrated  Asian  manufacturing  industry.  These 
differences  make  the  determination  of  how  best  to  achieve  the  desired  result  extremely 
tricky:  How  large  should  the  appreciation  be,  and  should  it  be  uniform  across  surplus 
countries?  Is  it  better  to  implement  it  gradually  or  through  one  large  initial  exchange  rate 
realignment? And after that, should exchange rates be managed or allowed to float, to let the 
market determine the final size of the adjustment? 
These  are  difficult  questions,  to  which  I  do  not  have  an  answer.  Based  on  Europe’s  long 
experience  of  monetary  cooperation  –  which  started  in  the  1970s  precisely  in  order  to 
address  the  challenges  of  global  currency  instability  for  a  group  of  closely  integrated 
countries  –  it  is  worth  recalling  that  progress  in  such  matters  often  stems  from  a  fruitful 
BIS Review 87/2009

tension between a leadership role taken by one or two countries and an unremitting effort to 
design arrangements and institutions that are balanced (if not always symmetric) and flexible 
enough to accommodate the needs of all participants. I don’t want to carry the parallel too 
far,  as  I  am  aware  of  the  important  differences  between  Europe  and  Asia,  but  I  think  that 
large and systemically important countries like China and Japan have a responsibility to exert 
leadership. At the same time, as the world we live in is truly global, the passage from the 
current Bretton Woods II non-system to a new international monetary system – more stable, 
better  defined  and  regulated  –  must  see  all  the  countries  affected,  especially  those  of  the 
G-20, as full active participants in its design and ownership.
