Stefan Ingves: Introduction on monetary policy and financial stability 
Speech  by  Mr  Stefan  Ingves,  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  before  the  Riksdag 
Committee on Finance, Stockholm, 5 November 2009. 
 A  little  more  than  a  year  has  passed  since  the  financial  crisis  swept  over  the  Swedish 
economy with full force. A dramatic year, which, despite vigorous measures by central banks 
and  other  authorities  around  the  world,  has  led  to  the  worst  economic  recession  for  many 
decades. But now the economy is beginning to recover, although it will take time before we 
are on firm ground again. So where in the crisis cycle do we stand today? How should the 
Riksbank act to attain the inflation target and to provide support to the economic recovery in 
the best possible manner? It appears as though the Swedish economy will land on its feet on 
this occasion, but it is also necessary to keep our balance in the future. This is in many ways 
a global challenge and a process of change, in which Sweden should play an active role.  
When  we  met  here  at  the  Committee  on  Finance  hearing  about  a  year  ago,  the  global 
financial  crisis  had  quite  recently  had  its  major  impact  on  Sweden.  The  problems  mainly 
originated  abroad  –  through  the  now  cross-border  financial  markets  and  through  the 
downswing in the world economy hitting an export-dependent economy like ours particularly 
hard. 
In the very turbulent and uncertain situation prevailing at that time, the main focus was on 
quickly making a diagnosis and implementing more or less acute measures – “intensive care” 
if you like. It was necessary to take rapid and forceful action to safeguard financial stability 
and to minimise the negative effects of the crisis on economic developments in general. For 
the  Riksbank  and  many  other  central  banks  the  "normal”  tools  have  not  been  sufficient  to 
achieve this. But we have adapted quickly, taken out a whole range of complementary tools 
from our workboxes, and even constructed some new ones!  
Now, one year later, the most acute phase of the financial crisis is now hopefully behind us. 
Although we have not yet climbed out of the trough that turned out to be the worst economic 
downturn  since  the  war.  But  there  are  many  indications  that  we  have  passed  the  turning 
point. 
In my speech today I intend to provide a brief status report of where we stand today and how 
we should to proceed. Are we about to land on our feet? How does the economic situation 
look  today  from  a  monetary  policy  perspective  and  what  lies  ahead  of  us?  What  is  the 
outlook for the financial system? Have the “extraordinary” measures taken had an effect and 
how should they be phased out? Even after we have landed properly it will be necessary to 
keep our balance. But the road ahead may be difficult to negotiate. So how do we create a 
better and more sustainable structure for the financial markets both nationally and globally?  
I do not have the perfect answers to all of these questions. I doubt that anyone has. But I 
shall spend the next 20 minutes trying to answer them to the best of my ability. And I hope 
this will provide a good basis for the coming hearing. 
Monetary policy and the economic situation 
The downturn in the world economy has been very rapid and severe – in this way the worst 
in  many  decades.  Sweden  is  an  export-dependent  economy  and  has  been  hit  hard  partly 
because of this. It will take time before the economy is back at the same level as prior to the 
crisis. But now we have come so far that the recovery has begun. One important component 
to  which  I  shall  also  return  is  that  the  conditions  on  the  financial  markets  have  improved. 
Several indicators are also showing that confidence in the future among both companies and

 The recovery will take time 
But  although  growth  will  recover  during  the  final  two  quarters  of  this  year,  we  believe  that 
GDP in Sweden will fall by more than 4 per cent in 2009. And it will take a long time before 
the economy is back at the same level as prior to the crisis. 2009 will be the first year since 
the  1940s  in  which  GDP  falls  in  the  world  as  a  whole.  But,  all  in  all,  there  are  many 
indications that the growth rate abroad and in Sweden has bottomed out and will rise in the 
years ahead (Figure 2).

With  regard  to  the  labour  market,  we  are  assuming  that  it  will  remain  weak  and  that 
unemployment will continue rising until the end of next year. Employment will not increase 
until the beginning of 2011. Historically, it is usually the case that employment recovers with 
some time lag after production has picked up. The weak labour market is expected to hold 
back  wage  increases  in  the  central  wage  bargaining  rounds  during  2010,  which  should 
contribute  to  lower  cost  and  inflationary  pressures.  And  even  if  economic  prospects  look 
better  than  we  anticipated  in  our  earlier  forecast  in  September,  we  will  have  more  spare 
capacity than normal in the Swedish economy throughout the forecast period.

Repo rate low until autumn 2010 
The Riksbank has cut the repo rate very substantially over a fairly short period of time, from 
4.75  per  cent  last  autumn  down  to  0.25  per  cent  in  July  this  year.  The  largest  cuts  were 
made mainly during last autumn and winter. Since February the repo rate has been lower 
than ever before during the period we have conducted inflation targeting (Figure 3).

We are currently expecting to hold the repo rate unchanged at a low level for a further period 
to come, until autumn 2010. This is necessary to contribute to a stable recovery and to attain 
the  inflation  target  of  2  per  cent.  Moreover,  we  Executive  Board  members  decided  at  the 
most recent monetary policy meeting that further measures were necessary to contribute to 
interest rates on loans to companies and households remaining low. We therefore decided to 
offer  the  banks  the  opportunity  to  borrow  from  the  Riksbank  at  a  fixed  interest  rate  and  a 
maturity of around 11 months. The loan auction was held on Monday this week and the final 
amount lent was SEK 95.3 billion. We expect the loans to the banks to complement the repo 
rate tool in a way that enables monetary policy to have the desired effect. 
Once  economic  activity  has  recovered,  we  are  intending  to  raise  the  repo  rate  to  more 
normal  levels.  This  is  necessary  to  ensure  a  balanced  economic  development  and  an 
inflation rate in line with our target. Our repo rate forecast is exactly that – a forecast, not a 
promise. But it is nevertheless important that anyone borrowing money to buy a home or for 
other reasons should include a sufficient margin, taking into account that today's low interest 
rates will not last for ever. Let me linger a bit with the housing market and interest rates as 
these subjects have much discussed recently.

Monetary policy and house prices 
One  issue  that  has  been  taken  up,  not  least  in  the  media,  is  that  the  policy  we  are  now 
conducting  could  possibly  contribute  to  a  further  rise  in  house  prices,  despite  the  weak 
economic activity. This could in turn increase the risk of imbalances arising in the housing 
market. It is true that the Riksbank’s policy, by affecting interest expenditure, has significance 
for the way housing prices develop, although many other factors are also important. But the 
policy we are currently conducting is what we consider to be necessary to attain the inflation 
target and to provide sufficient support for the recovery in the Swedish economy. We cannot 
adapt monetary policy on the basis of individual markets as long as we do not regard this as 
something  that  affects  our  ability  to  meet  the  inflation  target  and  to  safeguard  financial 
stability. But this does not mean that we do not care about house price movements. On the 
contrary, we closely follow developments in the housing market.

In the long term it is hardly sustainable that house prices should continue to rise as quickly 
as they have done since the mid-1990s (Figure 4). Since 1996 house prices have increased 
by  around  8  per  cent  a  year.  But  in  the  shorter  term,  our  assessment  is  that  there  is  no 
reason for the Riksbank to give greater consideration to house prices than we already do in 
our forecasts for the economy. 
Let  me  just  add  something  that  may  not  arise  very  often  in  the  general  debate  on  these 
issues. Although interest expenditure is one of the factors that has significance for the way 
house  prices  develop,  the  responsibility  for  sustainable  growth  with  regard  to  lending  and 
house  prices  is  largely  beyond  the  Riksbank’s  control.  Monetary  policy  can  probably  only 
function as a complement to effective regulation and supervision. And there are many factors 
that  are  important  in  ensuring  a  balanced  development  in  the  housing  market.  One 
fundamental factor is that households endeavour to make realistic calculations of how much 
interest  expenditure  and  amortisation  they  can  manage  in  the  long  run,  not  only  when 
interest rates are as low as they are now. Something that can be said to be the flip side of 
the same coin is that the banks make responsible credit assessments when lending money. 
If these two basic components are in place, there is a good chance of avoiding an out-of-
control situation further ahead, although as I said before there are many other factors that 
may be important. Finansinspektionen (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority) carries 
4 
 BIS Review 138/2009
out  very  important  work  here  in  that  they  monitor  developments  in  the  banks  and  credit 
institutions and are prepared to take action if they consider it necessary.

CPIF
Underlying inflation stable around target of 2 per cent 
The  impact  of  monetary  policy  on  households’  living  costs  is  something  that  creates  large 
fluctuations in CPI inflation during the forecast period (Figure 5). The fact that the repo rate 
has  been  cut  heavily  over  the  past  year  has  contributed  to  a  rapid  fall  in  CPI  inflation,  as 
changes  in  households’  mortgage  expenditure  are  included  in  this  index.  With  effect  from 
autumn  2010,  however,  the  repo  rate  is  expected  to  rise  relatively  quickly,  which  will 
correspondingly mean that CPI inflation will be close to 4 per cent at the beginning of 2012. 
On the other hand, one can use a measure of underlying inflation, the CPIF, which excludes 
the  direct  effects  of  the  repo  rate  on  mortgage  rates.  Measured  in  terms  of  the  CPIF,  we 
expect inflation to be much more stable and to be close to 2 per cent for most of the forecast 
period.

There  is  still  considerable  uncertainty  surrounding  future  developments  (Figure  3).  It  is 
possible  that  the  improved  situation  in  the  financial  markets  will  contribute  to  a  faster 
recovery in the world economy than we are expecting in the main scenario of the Monetary 
Policy Report. On the other hand, the recovery may be slower than expected when the fiscal 
policy  stimulation  packages  around  the  world  are  gradually  phased  out.  There  are  many 
potential  risks  along  the  way.  But  our  forecast  is  that  if  we  hold  the  repo  rate  low  up  to 
autumn 2010 and then begin raising it, this together with other measures will contribute to a 
stable recovery and mean we attain the inflation target of 2 per cent.

I and my colleagues on the Executive Board want the growth curve to look like a “v” when the 
economy recovers after the recession, as in the figure with our forecast for GDP growth, and 
not a “w” (see Figure 6). Having said that, let me just briefly comment on my own view of 
monetary policy as expressed in the minutes of our most recent monetary policy meeting. As 
I see the situation with regard to the Swedish economy, it is more important to allow some 
safety margin for a weaker outcome than for a stronger outcome. In my opinion, it would be 
more  problematic  if  the  recovery  ground  to  a  halt  because  we  had  provided  too  little 
stimulation than if we were later forced to put the brakes on a little harder than expected.

 So where do we stand with regard to the financial system? 
Where  we  stand  in  terms  of  the  economic  cycle  is  to  some  extent  connected  to 
developments  in  the  financial  markets.  The  second  part  of  my  status  report  therefore 
concerns where we stand in the crisis cycle with regard to the financial system, how the so-
called  unconventional  measures  we  have  taken  appear  to  have  worked  and  how  we  look 
upon them in the future. But, before we go on to this – let me give you a brief summary of the 
“extraordinary” or “unconventional” measures taken as a result of the financial crisis and its 
effects.  
“Extraordinary” or “unconventional” measures…    
When the international financial turmoil escalated into a worldwide crisis in September last 
year, many countries found it necessary to dig much deeper than usual into the economic 
policy toolbox to find partly new methods and tools. Governments, central banks and other 
authorities around  the  world  have  taken  extensive  measures  to  recreate  confidence  in  the 
financial markets, to maintain financial stability and to counteract the negative effects of the 
crisis on economic activity. The central banks’ measures, such as lending to the banks, are 
reflected in the fact that their balance sheets have increased substantially during the crisis, 
as can be seen in Figure 7.

As we have discussed earlier, the Riksbank has also implemented unconventional measures 
– measures in addition to the policy we would probably have conducted under more normal 
circumstances. The effects of these measures are in many cases similar, which means that it 
is difficult to compartmentalise them. However, even if the boundaries are not razor-sharp, it 
is possible to divide them up according to their basic purposes. There are measures which 
are  explicit monetary  policy  measures  with  the  aim  of  stimulating  demand  in  the economy 
further – since the repo rate is close to zero, the possibilities to use the “traditional” interest 
rate  tool  are  limited.  There  are  also  measures  that  have  been  implemented  to  safeguard 
financial stability.  
…to attain the inflation target... 
To  attain  the  inflation  target,  it  has  been  necessary  to  make  use  of  new  tools  to  get  the 
financial markets functioning better, to increase the access to loans and to try to bring down 
various  interest  rates  and  risk  premiums  that  have  counteracted  monetary  policy.  One 
example is that we have clearly communicated that we assume that the repo rate will remain 
at  0.25  per  cent  for  a  fairly  long  period  of  time.  In  our  most  recent  forecast  the  repo  rate 
remains  around  this  level  until  autumn  2010.  Another  measure  is  that  the  Riksbank  lends 
money  to  the  banks  at  longer  maturities  than  normal.  The  purpose  is  to  contribute  to 
continued lower interest rates on loans to companies and households. As I mentioned when I 
described the economic situation, we decided at our monetary policy meeting two weeks ago 
to supplement the low repo rate with such a loan.  
…and to safeguard financial stability. 
The  measures  implemented  to  safeguard  financial  stability  have  similar  effects,  but  the 
fundamental aim is different. The intention has mainly been to make it easier for the Swedish 
banks  to  manage  their  short-term  and  medium-term  funding.  Particularly  during  the  most 
intense  phase  of  the  crisis  it  was  difficult  for  the  banks  to  borrow  other  than  at  very  short 
maturities.  It  may  also  be  necessary  to  help  financial  markets  that  have  suffered  serious 
disruptions to function more smoothly. One can say that the Riksbank has functioned as an 
intermediary in the bank system – a function that the market does not normally require. One 
BIS Review 138/2009 
 7
example  in  this  area,  too,  is  the  loans  offered  to  the  banks  at  longer  maturities,  in  both 
Swedish kronor and US dollars. Another example is that the Riksbank has entered into what 
are known as swap agreements with the Fed and the ECB, which means that if necessary 
we can borrow dollars or euro in exchange for Swedish kronor. This type of swap agreement 
is, put simply, an agreement to buy a currency at a particular time and to sell it back at a later 
date. A further measure is that we accept more types of security as collateral when the banks 
borrow money from the Riksbank. Moreover, the Riksbank has in different contexts extended 
the list of eligible counterparties so that more financial agents will have the chance of easier 
management of liquidity and funding.  
Need to coordinate? 
“Exit strategy” is a buzzword that has been used for a while now. There is currently much 
discussion on how and when the measures taken around the world during the financial crisis 
are to be phased out. One question that is highlighted is that international coordination might 
be necessary for some of these processes.  
Some  of  the  discussion  concerns  timing  and  how  “aggressive”  one  can  be  when  slowing 
down  the  powerful  stimulation  from  fiscal  and  monetary  policy.  If  one  eases  up  on  the 
stimulation too soon and too hard, it may jeopardise the economic recovery. If one instead 
eases up too late and too little, there is a risk that inflationary pressures will be too strong. 
Here  I  believe  that  every  country  must  make  its  own  assessment,  as  conditions  differ  in 
different countries. One factor that could become important is that the stimulation from fiscal 
policy has put a lot of pressure on government finances in many countries. It might well be 
that  countries  with  a  high  national  debt  will  be  forced  for  budget  reasons  to  change  their 
fiscal  policy  sooner  than  they  desire.  This  could  be  a  risk  that  hampers  the  economic 
recovery, in the worst case for the world economy as a whole. 
There are also individual differences to take into account when coordinating the phasing out 
of  the  extraordinary  measures  taken  to  safeguard  financial  stability.  The  situation  looks 
different in different countries and it is not certain that everyone is prepared to throw away 
their crutches at the same time. When it comes to phasing out the support to the bank sector, 
however,  there  is  reason  to  coordinate  the  measures  as  far  as  possible.  Otherwise  the 
competition  between  banks  in  different  countries  may  be  distorted,  which  was  an  issue 
discussed when some countries introduced support measures at an early stage.  
Phasing out measures not so complicated for the Riksbank 
So  how  does  the  Riksbank  intend  to  phase  out  its  extraordinary  measures  in  the  cases 
where  the  changes  should  not  become  permanent  solutions?  Some  measures  will  in 
principle phase themselves out. The loans in US dollars from the Riksbank to the Swedish 
banks have actually already phased themselves out to some extent. The demand for dollar 
loans from the Riksbank has disappeared as the market has begun to function better. The 
mechanism is largely the same for the loans in Swedish kronor at longer maturities, which 
are offered at the repo rate plus a certain premium. By regulating the premium the Riksbank 
determines  how  attractive  the  loans  will  be  compared  to  the  conditions  prevailing  in  the 
market.  
The diagnosis that a measure is no longer needed may be difficult to make. Although, for 
instance, the demand for a particular type of loan may have disappeared, the fact that there 
is still a possibility to borrow may have a stabilising effect. We will not be in too much of a 
hurry.  And  there  are  at  least  two  items  we  need  to  be  able  to  cross  off  the  list  before  we 
begin phasing out the measures. We must be able to say with a good degree of certainty that 
the situation in the financial sector is stable and that it can function normally without support. 
We must also be in a situation where we expect to be able to attain the inflation target and 
stimulate the economy sufficiently without the unconventional measures.  
8 
 BIS Review 138/2009
There are other measures that require more active decisions by the Riksbank to be phased 
out.  For  instance,  the  number  of  counterparties  allowed  to  participate  in  fine-tuning 
operations  and  the  list  of  securities  accepted  as  eligible  collateral  for  credit  from  the 
Riksbank.  However,  it  is  not  self-evident  that  these  measures  will  actually  be  phased  out. 
These are questions of a more technical nature that we will examine further before it is time 
to make a decision.  
Have the extraordinary measures had an effect? 
So  have  the  extraordinary  measures  had  an  effect?  It  is  difficult  to  say  exactly  what  has 
affected the economy and in what way during a period when so much has happened, and so 
quickly. But certainly there are signs that the situation has improved.  
A more general observation is that lending in the Swedish economy does not seem to have 
been tightened more than can be expected in a recession. The fact that confidence between 
different  participants  in  the  financial  markets  more  or  less  completely  drained  away  at  the 
beginning of the crisis raised concern over a potential credit crunch. If the banks themselves 
experience funding problems, this could ultimately lead to a much more severe contraction in 
the supply of loans to households and companies than would normally occur in an economic 
downturn. This could in turn further worsen the economic situation, which we neither wished 
nor wish to see.  
But it appears as though the measures taken to restore confidence in the financial markets, 
together with the substantial cuts in the repo rate, have had the right effect. The opportunities 
to  borrow  in  the  market  are  relatively  good,  both  for  large  companies  and  for  banks.  The 
Riksbank’s  company  surveys  and  the  National  Institute  of  Economic  Research’s  Business 
Tendency  Survey  also  indicate  that  the  funding  situation  has  improved.  Financial  market 
statistics show that lending to households via banks and credit institutions is increasing, but 
at a slower rate than before (Figure 8). Lending to companies is declining, but not by very 
much considering that we are in a recession.

If  we  look  at  the  conditions  in  the  financial  markets  from  an  interest  rate  perspective  –  in 
terms of price instead of volume – they have become less strained during 2009. This can be 
seen, for instance, if one looks at what are usually known as TED spreads – the difference 
between the interbank rate, where the banks lend to one another, and the government bond 
rate, both with a maturity of three months (Figure 9). The TED spread can be regarded as an 
indicator of confidence between the banks. One can say that this is a premium that reflects 
liquidity  risk,  credit  risk  and  the  demand  for  safer  assets.  The  demand  for  government 
securities tends to increase during times of financial market turmoil.

Both  in  Sweden  and  in  other  countries  the  TED  spread  rose  substantially  when  the  crisis 
became acute in connection with Lehman Brothers filing for bankruptcy last autumn. Since 
then it has gradually fallen, although it is still above the levels that prevailed prior to the crisis. 
This indicates greater confidence between the banks. The total measures have probably had 
considerable  significance.  In  particular,  the  large  injections  of  liquidity  that  come  from  the 
central banks still lending large amounts to the banks should contribute to reducing the TED 
spread.

Yes, although we are not yet on solid ground!  
For part of my professional life I have come to work with managing financial crises in different 
parts  of  the  world,  both  here  in  Sweden  and  for  the  IMF.  I  know  that  it  is  difficult  to  say 
exactly where in the course of the crisis an economy is at a particular point in time and how 
fast the recovery will be. The financial system is functioning better, but we cannot say with 
any certainty to what extent the recovery is still dependent on support measures from various 
authorities. We still have, for instance, outstanding loans to the banks of around SEK 385.3 
billion. The financial markets are approaching normality. It is actually difficult to say exactly 
what can be regarded as “normality”, but I would like to emphasise that in several cases it 
should mean a situation where the price of risk is higher than it was prior to the crisis. It is 
fairly natural that someone investing their money should want compensation for taking a risk. 
And  the  price  of  risk  was  unrealistically  low  in  many  cases  prior  to  the  crisis.  The  same 
applies to the investors’ impression of how much risk they were exposing themselves to. It is 
10 
 BIS Review 138/2009
therefore possible that what is counted as normal in the future with regard to risk will entail 
slightly higher interest rates with a given repo rate. 
The  need  for  the  authorities’  measures  will  decline  as  conditions  in  the  financial  sector 
improve  and  the  world  economy  shows  clearer  signs  of  a  recovery.  But  the  risk  of  further 
complications  arising  cannot  be  ruled  out.  One  example  is  the  uncertainty  over  how  the 
severe recession in the Baltic countries and eastern Europe will affect the Swedish banks’ 
loan losses. However, if all goes well and the situation remains stable, then it is time to move 
on without support. But we are not there yet.  
How shall we keep our balance in the future? 
In a financial crisis most of what is not built on stable foundations and does not have a robust 
structure is washed away. But when the situation has calmed, we have the chance to build 
up something new that will work better than that which failed the trials. We have this chance 
now.  
We must take part in the change work 
Keeping  our  balance  once  we  have  landed  on  our  feet  will  require  reforms  with  regard  to 
legislation and supervision. Difficult and important challenges lie ahead of those of us who 
work  with  these  issues  –  the  central  banks,  the  financial  supervisory  authorities  and  the 
legislators.  Here  Sweden  must  take  on  the  challenge  and  play  an  active  role  in  the 
international  discussion.  And  it  is  necessary  to  act  quickly.  The  reform  work  has  already 
begun.  Within  the  EU  a  new  supervisory  structure  is  being  built  up  with  regard  to  banks, 
insurance, securities and systemic risk. The new body, the European Systemic Risk Board, 
ESRB, will play an important role in this. 
Change is required in a number of different areas. The most recent crisis has demonstrated 
how  a  liquid  market  can  very  quickly  dry  up  and  become  illiquid  under  certain  conditions. 
Tougher rules are required regarding liquidity and the buffer that banks and credit institutions 
need to be able to withstand shocks. Further consideration is required here before we find a 
good solution. It is also necessary to develop further the analysis of asset prices and how the 
financial markets can be better integrated into our models and forecasts. This applies both 
with regard to the work on financial stability and the work on monetary policy. 
The supervision map is being redrawn 
A further area for reform concerns the supervision of the financial system as a whole, and the 
possibility  to  take  measures  when  risks  to  the  stability  of  the  system  are  detected.  The 
central  banks  often  have  both  the  responsibility  and  the  best  resources  to  analyse  such 
systemic risks, as they are called. But they usually do not have particularly sharp tools for 
dealing  with  them.  In  most  cases  the  central  banks  must  rely  on  being  able  to  affect 
unsatisfactory states of things by providing information and warning of risks. But when times 
are “good” on the financial markets, it may be difficult to get anyone to listen to this type of 
warning. Before the crisis broke out, for instance, the Riksbank warned in several speeches 
and reports that there were risks regarding developments in the Baltic and risks connected 
with low compensation for risk in the financial markets. And we were not the only ones to 
point out these risks. But the market participants did not pay sufficient heed to the warnings. 
The crisis has shown that there must be an opportunity to put greater force behind the words 
if warnings are to have any effect. 
The tools for exercising greater pressure may entail, for instance, changing the requirements 
regarding an individual bank or several banks if necessary. But such tools are not usually at 
the disposal of the central banks; they are held by the financial supervisory authorities. The 
problem is that these supervisory authorities often do not have the task of supervising banks 
BIS Review 138/2009 
 11
and  other  financial  agents  from  a  system  perspective  at  “macro  level”.  They  more  often 
examine  the  individual  participants  at  “micro  level".  This  task  is  of  course  very  important. 
However, there may be systemic risks that need correction, but which are not evident when 
individual banks are examined separately.  
The recent crisis has clearly shown that supervision is necessary, and also the opportunity to 
take measures at both micro level with regard to individual participants and macro level from 
both a national and an international systemic perspective. The financial supervision map is 
being  redrawn.  Bearing  in  mind  the  experiences  of  the  recent  crisis,  I  believe  for  instance 
that  the  Riksbank  and  Finansinspektionen  will  work  more  closely  together  than  before. 
Greater cooperation between the authorities is one part of the solution, but I believe that the 
central banks also need to have slightly “sharper teeth” – more and sharper tools in this area.  
Cooperation and trust 
When  it  comes  to  handling  and  preventing  a  global  crisis  like  the  one  we  are  currently 
emerging from, something more is needed, namely trust. This is required to improve cross-
border crisis management and to create effective cooperation between authorities even in an 
emergency. Trust can also be a key factor in preventing a crisis from occurring at all. It is not 
enough for individual authorities and countries to take action when the banks’ playing field is 
the entire international arena. The scope of the crisis on this occasion was connected to the 
financial  markets’  national  boundaries  largely  being  erased.  But  the  cure  in  this  case 
concerns, as I see it, meeting globalisation with globalisation. More cross-border cooperation 
is required, and perhaps using different methods than before.  
Landing on our feet and keeping our balance in the future 
Let me conclude by saying that I have every hope that we will land firmly on both feet when 
this crisis is over. There are many things that have been out of balance around the world. 
And  the  longer  the  imbalances  are  allowed  to  continue  growing,  the  larger  the  fall  will  be 
when one finally loses one’s footing. We have been hit by a financial crisis that is without 
precedent in a global context. We have been hit by the worst recession since the Second 
World  War.  The  recovery  will  take  time,  both  with  regard  to  the  financial  system  and  the 
economy in general. But it has begun, even if there is considerable uncertainty over future 
developments and there are many risks lining the path.  
Once we have regained our balance we must keep it. Creating the right conditions for this is 
a  difficult  but  important  task.  It  involves  the  work  on  both  financial  stability  and  monetary 
policy.  It  involves  extensive  reforms  and  cooperation  between  central  banks  and  other 
authorities around the world. We must tackle this task not only at a national level, but also 
from a global perspective. The work has already begun, and we are in a phase of the crisis 
where there are good prospects for achieving change. It is now that we have the chance to 
really create something that will last and will work better. We must not miss this opportunity!
