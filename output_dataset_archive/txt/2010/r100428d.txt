Svante Öberg: Public finances and monetary policy 
Speech by Mr Svante Öberg, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Sveriges 
akademikers centralorganisation (SACO), Stockholm, 26 April 2010. 
 Public finances are of central importance to stable economic development 
The  financial  crisis  has  made  it  clear  just  how  important  it  is  for  a  country  to  have  sound 
public finances and for confidence in fiscal policy to be maintained. The situation in Greece 
and  several  other  countries  arouses  unpleasant  memories  of  the  crisis  in  Sweden  in  the 
1990s.  Being  forced  to  pay  higher  and  higher  interest  rates  on  a  rapidly  growing  central 
government debt is not an enviable situation to be in, nor is being forced to increase taxes 
and  reduce  public  expenditure  at  the  same  time  as  unemployment  is  rising.  When  such  a 
situation arises it also becomes much more difficult to use monetary policy to inject new life 
into the economy because the interest rates in the economy begin to be affected more by the 
credit rating of the central government than by the central bank policy rate.  
In  this  speech  I  intend  to  discuss  the  importance  of  public  finances  for  stable  economic 
development in the slightly longer term and the implications they have for monetary policy. I 
will not, on the other hand, comment on the formulation of fiscal policy in the short term. I 
would like to point out that the assessments and values expressed here are my own and that 
they are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Executive Board of the Riksbank. 
Public finances have deteriorated 
In  2008  and  2009,  public  expenditure  in  most  industrial  nations  increased  while  revenue 
declined. Expenditure in the OECD area as a whole increased as a percentage of GDP from 
40 per cent in 2007 to 45 per cent in 2009, while revenue as a percentage of GDP fell from 
39 per cent in 2007 to 37 per cent in 2009.1 (Slide: Public finances in the OECD countries). 
The situation with regard to general government net lending, that is the relationship between 
public-sector  revenue  and  expenditure,  has  therefore  deteriorated.  The  deficit  in  public 
finances  in  the  OECD  area  has  increased  from  1  per  cent  of  GDP  to  8  per  cent  of  GDP. 
(Slide: General government net lending in the OECD countries). 
This has in turn led to a substantial increase in public-sector indebtedness. The gross debt of 
the public sector in the OECD area has increased from 73 per cent of GDP in 2007 to 90 per 
cent of GDP in 2009 and will continue to grow rapidly as long as the large deficit remains. 
(Slide: Gross public debt in the OECD countries). 
The problem is largely the same for all the established industrial countries. However, there 
are  significant  variations.  For  instance,  the  public-sector  deficit  has  increased  more  in  the 
USA during the crisis than in the euro area. (Slide: General government net lending in the 
United States and the euro area).  
There are also major differences between the countries in the euro area. In some of the euro 
countries the deterioration in public finances has been dramatic. I will come back to this later.

There are several reasons for the deterioration in public finances 
There are a number of causes behind the substantial deficits in public finances. Firstly, many 
countries were in a weak initial position even before the crisis began, as their public finances 
were already in deficit. Many countries failed to save money for a rainy day when times were 
good.  This  is  illustrated  by  the  fact  that  in  the  decade  prior  to  the  crisis  average  general 
government net lending was –2 per cent of GDP in the OECD area, the USA and the euro 
area.  In  the  case  of  the  euro  area  this  is  remarkable  given  that  the  so-called  growth  and 
stability  pact  stipulates that  the  aim  should  be  to  achieve  a  balance  or  a  surplus  in  public 
finances in the medium term. (Slide: Average general government net lending).  
Secondly, a downturn automatically leads to a weakening of public finances. Tax revenues 
fall  and  cyclical  expenditure,  for  example  on  labour-market  policy,  increases.  The  OECD 
estimates that this effect has accounted for just under half of the total deterioration in public 
finances since 2007.  
Thirdly,  most  countries  have  implemented  extensive  fiscal  policy  stimulus  measures.  The 
OECD estimates that these measures have accounted for just over half of the reduction in 
general  government  net  lending  in  the  OECD  area.  In  the  United  States,  where  stimulus 
packages have been introduced on an unprecedented scale, the OECD estimates that these 
active stimulus measures have accounted for as much as three-quarters of the deterioration 
in public-sector finances. In the euro area it is instead the automatic effects on tax revenues 
and cyclical expenditures that have predominated. 
Consequences of the deterioration 
Extensive historical studies of financial crises show that they are often followed by a severe 
weakening  of  public  finances  and  prolonged  periods  of  subdued  GDP  growth.2  The 
deterioration in public finances that we have seen during this crisis will keep GDP growth and 
inflation  down  in  many  regions  for  some  time  to  come,  as  the  weak  finances  will  enforce 
fiscal policy contraction and/or may lead to higher interest rates. 
A tighter fiscal policy is inevitable to make public finances stable in the long term. Restoring 
the deficit to the level that prevailed prior to the crisis, and one might ask whether this will be 
sufficient, is not simply a case of replacing the fiscal policy stimulus measures implemented 
during  the  crisis  with  corresponding  tightening  measures  after  the  crisis.  In  addition, 
expenditures  have  to  be  replaced  as  potential  GDP  and  thus  potential  tax  revenue  have 
fallen  due  to  the  crisis.  The  OECD  estimates  that  potential  GDP  in  the  OECD  area  will 
decline by around 4 per cent as a result of the crisis. All in all, this means that public finances 
in the OECD area require a structural strengthening of around 5–6 per cent of GDP over the 
coming years. 
At  the  same  time,  several  factors  indicate  that  interest  rates  will  rise,  which  will  lead  to 
increased  interest  expenditure  and  thus  put  even  greater  pressure  on  public  finances. 
Monetary policy is expected to become less expansionary in the years immediately ahead, 
which  means  that  short-term  interest  rates  will  rise.  The  large  general  government  deficits 
and thus rising borrowing requirements will probably lead to higher government bond rates. 
In addition, there is the premium that the market participants require as compensation for the 
risk  that  the  debt  may  become  unsustainable.  Meanwhile,  stricter  financial  regulations  will 
probably also lead to higher interest rates. 
In the past, there have been periods when the debts of the public sector as a percentage of 
GDP  have  been  reduced  as  a  result  of  high  inflation.  But  as  experiences  of  the  harmful 
effects of inflation have led to more or less explicit inflation targets for central bank activities 
                                                 
2   See Reinhart and Rogoff (2009).

and as interest rates tend to adapt very quickly to inflation expectations, it is not probable 
that higher inflation will reduce public-sector debt as a percentage of GDP. 
Our own experience from the Swedish budget consolidation process of the 1990s shows that 
it  is  important  for  the  credibility  of  fiscal  policy  not  just  to  make  general  statements  about 
what  needs  to  be  done  to  achieve  a  balance, but  also  to make  concrete  decisions  on  the 
spending cuts and/or tax increases that are considered necessary. Experience also shows 
that it is important to base forecasts regarding improvements in public finances on cautious 
assumptions about economic growth. 
It may also be worth recalling that there is a link between fiscal policy tightening measures 
and interest rates. More stringent and credible tightening measures can lead to lower interest 
rates as they justify lower risk premiums and lower policy rates. 
The problems in Greece and other vulnerable countries 
In  those  countries  where  public  finances  are  particularly  strained,  developments  may  be 
more dramatic if they prove unable to implement the necessary fiscal tightening measures in 
an orderly way. In a situation where there is a need to renew loans but no one wants to lend, 
there are in practice two choices, that is, to either default on debt payments or to stop paying 
wages  to  public  employees,  pensions  and  so  on.  Rapidly  increasing  interest  rates  and  an 
exploding  central  government  debt  that  leads  to  the  suspension  of  payments  are 
unfortunately entirely in line with the experience of previous episodes of financial crisis.3 This 
would normally also lead to problems in the bank sector, which ultimately risks leading to a 
new financial crisis. 
Greece’s problems 
Greece  is  the  country  that  has lately  been  the main  subject  of  speculation  and  discussion 
with regard to the sustainability of its public finances. Decades of substantial public-finance 
deficits have meant that Greece entered this recession with a gross public debt of over 100 
per  cent  of GDP.  The  growth  of  the  Greek  economy  has  so  far  been  less  affected  by  the 
global  economic  downturn  than  the  OECD  average.  This  is  partly  explained  by  Greece’s 
relatively limited exposure to the world market but also by a considerable increase in public 
expenditure. This increase in expenditure, together with a slight fall in revenues, means that 
public sector indebtedness in Greece has increased to 115 per cent of GDP, and according 
to  OECD  forecasts  from  November  it  is  expected  to  reach  130  per  cent  of  GDP  in  2011. 
(Slide: Gross public debt in Greece). 
The development of the central government debt in Greece, together with uncertainty about 
the country’s ability to actually carry out the far-reaching consolidation of its public finances, 
has caused Greek government bond rates to rocket. The market participants have seen an 
imminent  risk  that  Greece  will  not  be  able  to  overcome  its  debt  crisis  without  outside 
assistance. (Slide: Difference between Greece’s and Germany’s government bond rates). 
A couple of weeks ago, the euro countries reached an agreement, together with the IMF, on 
the design of a financial support package for Greece in order to safeguard financial stability 
in  the  euro  area.  However,  the  aid  measures  promised  so  far  have  not  succeeded  in 
reassuring the markets.

Several other countries also have serious problems with their public finances 
Other  countries  are  also  experiencing  serious  problems.  Among  the  euro  countries,  apart 
from  Greece,  these  are  mainly  Portugal,  Italy,  Ireland  and  Spain.  Critical  conditions  for 
assessing how these countries shall attain a sustainable development of their public finances 
in the future are the current size of the public sector debt in relation to GDP, the credibility of 
their future fiscal policy and the conditions for growth in domestic and external demand.  
The larger a country’s debt in relation to its GDP, the greater its interest expenditure and the 
closer  it  is  to  an  untenable  situation.  Among  the  countries  I  just  mentioned,  Italy  has  the 
largest burden of debt, with a gross public debt similar to that of Greece at just over 100 per 
cent  of  GDP.  The  other  countries  are  not  quite  so  vulnerable,  but  their  debts  are  rising 
rapidly. (Slide: Gross public debt in Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain). 
The credibility of their future fiscal policy is a decisive factor, not least for the rate of interest 
they are forced to pay on their public debt. Here, earlier patterns of balance or deficit play an 
important role, as does, of course, the content of their fiscal policy consolidation programme. 
The deficits are currently large in all of the vulnerable countries, but while Ireland and Spain 
have been able to show a balance or surplus during the years prior to the crisis, Italy and 
Portugal  have  shown  a  deficit  throughout.  (Slide:  General  government  net  lending  in 
Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain). 
A  common  precondition  for  the  ability  of  these  countries  to  renew  their  loans  at  a 
manageable cost is the credibility of their fiscal policy consolidation plans. The example of 
Ireland points to a credible consolidation plan with concrete decisions on large cuts in public 
expenditure  being  able  to  reverse  an  upward  trend  in  interest  rates,  while  the  greatest 
pressure is currently on Portugal, where the ten-year rate rose last week. (Slide: Government 
bond rates of Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain, compared with those of Germany). 
The more favourable the conditions for the development of domestic and foreign demand, 
the greater are the chances that good GDP growth will be able to reduce the problems in 
public finances. Those countries that have not had large falls in asset prices, including Italy, 
do  not  risk  suppressed  domestic  demand  in  the  same  way  as,  for  instance,  Spain  and 
Ireland, where property prices have fallen substantially. 
With  regard  to  demand  from  abroad,  the  problems  are  made  more  severe  by  wages  and 
prices having grown faster in these countries than in the euro area as a whole since the euro 
was introduced. This deterioration in competitiveness can be illustrated by the fact that unit 
labour costs have increased by between 10 to 20 per cent more than in the euro area as a 
whole  since  2000,  and  even  more  in  relation  to  unit  labour  costs  in  Germany.  The 
deterioration in competitiveness entails less chance of a boost from exports and thus poorer 
opportunities  for  a  rapid  recovery  as  international  demand  increases.  (Slide:  Unit  labour 
costs compared to the euro area). 
The strong growth in domestic demand in recent years and the weaker competitiveness have 
resulted  in  a  current  account  deficit  and  thus  rising  foreign  debts.  (Slide:  Current  account 
deficits). 
In  the  case  of  countries  with  their  own  currencies  one  would  expect  a  depreciation  of  the 
currency to restore competitiveness. This opportunity is not available to the countries in the 
euro  area.  Here,  it  is  instead  necessary  for  wages  and  prices  to  fall  in  relation  to  other 
countries. One difficulty in this context is that both public and private debts and the interest 
payable grow in real terms – that is, a larger part of production goes to meeting the costs of 
the debts.  
Developments in Germany show that such internal cost-cutting in relation to other countries 
is  fully  possible.  The  combination  of  a  muted  growth  in  nominal  wages  and  productivity 
improvements  has  led  to  unit  labour  costs  in  Germany  falling  by  15  per  cent  since  2000, 
compared with the euro area as a whole. In the Baltic countries, which have not yet adopted 
4 
 BIS Review 56/2010
the  euro,  but  have  retained  fixed  exchange  rates  throughout  the  crisis,  one  can  even  see 
falling wages.  
The situation of the United Kingdom has certain similarities to that of the group of countries I 
have just described. Following several years of a deficit in the region of 3 per cent of GDP, 
the crisis entailed a rapid deterioration to a deficit of 13 per cent in 2009. According to the 
OECD’s  forecast,  gross  public  debt  in  the  United  Kingdom  will  double  between  2007  and 
2011. Here, too, we can see an increase in unit labour costs compared to the euro area, but 
the  crucial  difference  is  that  the  weaker  pound  has  made  it  possible  to  strengthen 
competitiveness. (Slide: General government net lending in the United Kingdom). 
Things look better in Sweden 
Public finances in Sweden are in a much better state than in many other countries. However, 
our experience of the severe Swedish crisis in the early 1990s is reminiscent of the situation I 
have  just  outlined  for  some  of  the  euro  countries  today.  At  that  time,  our  public  finances 
deteriorated from a surplus of 3 per cent of GDP in 1990 to a deficit of 11 per cent of GDP in 
1993. (Slide: General government net lending in Sweden). 
This  put  us  in  a  situation  with  a  gross  public  debt  of  84  per  cent  of  GDP,  a  central 
government debt of 76 per cent of GDP and interest expenditure amounting to over 6 per 
cent of GDP in 1996. (Slide: Sweden’s central government debt and gross public debt). 
Like the countries in the euro area whose public finances are in a poor state today, Sweden 
had  also  experienced  problems  with  the  development  of  costs.  However,  unlike  these 
countries,  it  was  possible  for  us  to  limit  the  loss  of  competitiveness  by  means  of  a 
depreciation  of  the  currency,  just  as  in  the  United  Kingdom  today.  We  also  had  a 
long-established  pattern  of  substantial  surpluses  in  public  finances  in  normal  times,  which 
probably increased the credibility of our consolidation measures and thus limited our costs 
for financing the central government debt. 
At  the  beginning  of  the  current  downturn  we  had  a  surplus  in  public  finances  of  around 
4 per cent  of  GDP  in  2007  and  it  looks  as  though  we  will  have  a  deficit  of  approximately  
1–2 per  cent  of  GDP  in  2010.  This  is  a  weakening  of  the  budget  balance  of  the  same 
magnitude as that expected for the euro area, and unlike most other EU countries, it appears 
that Sweden will be able to stay above the stability and growth pact’s deficit limit of 3 per cent 
of  GDP.  The  comparison  with  the  euro  area  and  the  United  Kingdom  is  striking.  (Slide: 
General government net lending in Sweden, the euro area and the United Kingdom).  
The  strong  public  finances  to  start  with  have  helped  Sweden  to  pursue  an  expansionary 
fiscal policy during the crisis without putting the long-term sustainability of public finances at 
risk,  and  to  keep  interest  rates  down  at  German  levels.  (Slide:  Government  bond  rates  of 
different countries). 
Important to have a surplus over the economic cycle 
One of the reasons why public finances in Sweden are so strong is that after the crisis of the 
1990s  the  government  and  parliament  formulated  a  surplus  target  for  the  public  sector. 
Public finances were to show a surplus of 2 per cent of GDP over an economic cycle. This 
was in line with the growth and stability pact in the EU, which among other things meant that 
public finances should be in balance in the medium term, or show a surplus. This target was 
changed to 1 per cent of GDP when the definition of general government net lending was 
changed in the National Accounts. During the ten-year period prior to the most recent crisis, 
the surplus averaged 1.4 per cent of GDP and it was possible to reduce the gross public debt 
by almost half in this period. 
BIS Review 56/2010

The framework for fiscal policy also includes another essential part, the expenditure ceiling 
that prescribes an upper limit in Swedish kronor for general government expenditure over the 
coming  three  years.  This  has  been  a  decisive  factor  in  contributing  to  the  fall  in  public 
expenditure as a percentage of GDP from 56 per cent in 1998 to 50 per cent in 2007. 
It is important to continue using a surplus target for public finances over the next ten years. 
There  are  two  main  reasons  for  this.  Firstly,  it  will  strengthen  Sweden’s  ability  to  manage 
crises and recessions. If there is a public-finance surplus when a crisis begins, there is little 
risk that the deficit will exceed the 3 per cent of GDP limit of the growth and stability pact 
when the crisis is most severe.  
Secondly,  averaging  a  surplus  over  an  economic  cycle  means  that  the  indebtedness  and 
interest expenditure of the public sector will decrease over time. In a review of the lessons 
that can be learned from this crisis, Olivier Blanchard, Chief Economist at the IMF, points to 
the  value  of  “fiscal  space"  in  the  form  of  strong  public  finances  in  the  initial  position  and 
mentions that fiscal policy rules may be helpful in this respect.4 
The surplus target is thus a valuable component of the Swedish fiscal policy framework. It 
anchors expectations regarding public finances in such a way that those who are interested 
in  investing  in  Swedish  government  securities  can  be  relatively  certain  about  how  public 
sector  finances  will  develop  in  the  longer  term.  It  reduces  uncertainty  regarding  the 
preconditions  for  saving  and  investment.  The  more  established  the  surplus  target  is 
perceived to be, the higher will be the credibility of Swedish fiscal policy and the lower will be 
the future interest rates on Sweden’s central government debt. 
There  is  a  clear  parallel  here  with  the  Riksbank’s  inflation  target.5  The  more  certain 
households and companies are that inflation will be close to the inflation target, the less time 
and  energy  they  will  need  to  devote  to  adapting  their  savings,  investments  and  wages  to 
inflation, and the fairer price setting in the economy will be. 
From the Riksbank’s perspective, it is also clear that monetary policy will be more efficient 
the more predictable developments in public finances are, and the greater the confidence in 
the sustainability of fiscal policy. Predictability is important to us as our forecasts for fiscal 
policy  affect  our  assessments  of  resource  utilisation  and  future  inflationary  pressures. 
Confidence in the sustainability of fiscal policy is important as otherwise it will be the market 
participants’ demands for risk premiums, which often vary substantially, rather than our repo 
rate path, which determine interest rates. 
For  these  reasons  the  Riksbank  has,  in  its  response  to  a  consultative  document  from  the 
government in March this year, expressed its support for making the surplus target obligatory 
by incorporating it into the Budget Act. We have also declared that we share the assessment 
that general government net lending over the next 10 years should once again average 1 per 
cent of GDP.  
Consequences for Swedish monetary policy 
When determining Swedish monetary policy, there are several reasons why we should pay 
particular attention to the conduct of fiscal policy in Sweden and abroad over the next few 
years. 
Firstly, the large deficits in public finances around the world will dampen the growth of GDP. 
Fiscal policy will be tightened sooner or later, which will also dampen GDP in the short term. 
The fact that nearly all countries will need to strengthen their public finances at more or less 
                                                 
4   See Blanchard (2010). 
5   See Leeper (2009).

 BIS Review 56/2010
the same time means that we can assume that growth impulses from abroad will be weaker 
then normal. There is also a risk that the major public deficits will drive up long-term interest 
rates for government bonds, which will have an additional dampening effect on growth.  
Secondly, there is a risk that developments will be more dramatic than we expect. Greece is 
not the only country with serious problems. Several countries in southern Europe also have 
major problems with their public finances. The deficits in the United States and the United 
Kingdom are very substantial, too. What we call sovereign risk has recently become the main 
risk  to  the  financial  system.  When  risk  premiums  for  countries  increase,  banks  in  these 
countries may also experience financing problems, and these problems can spread to banks 
in other countries. 
Thirdly,  monetary  policy  will  be  affected  by  fiscal  policy  in  Sweden.  Swedish  fiscal  policy 
constitutes  one  of  the  external  preconditions  for  monetary  policy.  However,  fiscal  policy  in 
Sweden does not need to be tightened to the same extent as fiscal policy in other countries. 
The Government is assuming in its Spring Fiscal Policy Bill that public finances will weaken 
further by one percentage point to a deficit of –2 per cent in 2010, while we at the Riksbank 
believe  that  the  deficit  will  stop  at  –1  per  cent.  After  that,  we  are  assuming,  as  is  the 
government,  that  there  will  be  a  gradual  improvement  in  public  finances  of  around  one 
percentage point a year. If fiscal policy is different from our expectations, this may affect the 
picture of resource utilisation and inflationary pressures, and this could be a reason to adjust 
the forecast for the repo rate in the future. 
Concluding remarks 
Debt  crises  in  several  areas  in  the  world  around  us  have  illustrated  the  importance  of 
sustainable public finances. The large deficits in public finances in the wake of the financial 
crisis tend to lead to higher interest rates and will force tighter fiscal policy to be conducted, 
which  will  subdue  growth  abroad.  This  is  a  factor  which  means  that  in  our  most  recent 
Monetary Policy Update we assume that GDP growth in Europe will be relatively weak over 
the coming years. 
There is also a risk of a more dramatic development. Greece has recently been the primary 
object of speculations regarding the sustainability of public finances. But Greece is not the 
only potential problem. Other countries also have major problems. In a worst case scenario, 
this could develop into a debt crisis in several countries, which also affects the bank system. 
In Sweden the surplus target has led to greater confidence and predictability with regard to 
developments  in  public  finances.  The  strong  public  finances  have  also  enabled  us  to  use 
fiscal  policy  stimulus  measures  during  the  recession  without  jeopardising  the  long-term 
stability in public finances. The Riksbank supports the idea of a surplus target being included 
in the Budget Act and that the target should be set as a surplus of 1 per cent of GDP over the 
coming ten years.  
If  fiscal  policy  is  predictable  and  sustainable,  then  we  at  the  Riksbank  can  make  better 
assessments  of  resource  utilisation  and  inflationary  pressures.  This  helps  us  to  conduct  a 
well-balanced monetary policy.
