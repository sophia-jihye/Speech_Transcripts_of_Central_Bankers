Svante Öberg: The economic situation 
Speech  by  Mr  Svante  Öberg,  First  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  to  the 
Västerbotten Chamber of Commerce, Umeå, 25 August 2011. 
  My message today can be summarised in four points: 
 
 
Developments have been dramatic over the summer.  
However,  statistics  for  the  Swedish  economy  received  during  the  summer  have 
been in line with the forecasts made in July. 
The turbulence on the financial markets has nevertheless increased uncertainty over 
future developments. 
We will discuss how this may affect monetary policy in September. 
 
It is now the fourth year in a row that I have held a speech on the current economic situation 
in the month of August. Normally, I give an account of the most recent forecasts from the 
latest  monetary  policy  decision  in  late  June/early  July  and  of  the  statistics  received  since 
then. This year it seems justified to give just a brief account of the forecasts made before the 
summer holidays and of the new statistics and to instead discuss events during the summer 
and  what  future  consequences  they  might  have.  I  shall  therefore  begin  with  a  brief 
background, and then move on to discuss in more detail the turbulent developments in the 
financial  markets  during  the  summer,  concluding  with  a  few  words  about  the  problems  I 
believe we will face at the next monetary policy meeting.  
July monetary policy report 
Continued recovery in the world economy as a whole… 
We pointed out in the July Monetary Policy Report that growth in the world as a whole was 
good. The forecast was that GDP growth in the coming years would be just over 4 per cent a 
year,  which  is  higher  than  the  historical  average.  The  emerging  economies,  including  the 
BRIC  countries  (Brazil,  Russia,  India  and  China),  acted  as  motor  (see  Figure  1).  We  also 
noted  that  inflation  was  relatively  high  in  many  countries,  but  that  energy  and  commodity 
prices in the world market, which rose substantially last year and had pushed up inflation, 
had levelled off or fallen slightly this year (see Figure 2).  
…but the recovery in the United States and euro area is sluggish  
However, the international outlook was divided. The recovery in the United States and the 
euro area was expected to be slow (see Figure 3).  
GDP growth in the United States was expected to be just over 2 per cent this year and to 
only gradually return to more normal levels of around 3 per cent. Unemployment had fallen 
only marginally from the peak levels noted in the most acute phase of the financial crisis. The 
impact of energy and commodity prices on inflation had been surprisingly large in the United 
States, which had led to inflation being relatively high (see Figure 4). We also noted that the 
United  States  needed  to  reduce  the  large  deficits  in  its  federal  budget,  which  would  entail 
fiscal policy tightening over the coming years.  
GDP  growth  in  the  euro  area  was  expected  to  be  around  2  per  cent  a  year  during  the 
forecast period. But there were substantial differences between countries. Germany, which is 
the largest economy in the euro area, showed relatively rapid growth, driven by exports and 
the  upswing  in  world  trade.  At  the  same  time,  developments  in  southern  Europe  were

hampered by the sovereign debt problems. We also noted that inflation was still high in the 
euro area and above the ECB’s inflation target, partly because energy and food prices had 
risen (see Figure 4).  
Strong but declining growth and rising inflation in Sweden 
GDP growth in Sweden was expected to be high this year, around 4.5 per cent, but then to 
slow  down  to  more  normal  rates  of  increase  of  around  2.5  per  cent  a  year  in  the  coming 
years (see Figure 5).  
All components of demand contributed to the positive development. Household consumption 
was  expected  to  increase  by  between  2  and  2.5  per  cent  a  year  over  the  coming  years. 
Exports  benefitted  from  the  upswing  in  world  trade,  but  we  assessed  that  export  growth 
would slow down in the coming period and approach more normal levels. A strong economic 
situation,  combined  with  historically-low  investment  levels,  meant  that  investments  in 
Sweden were expected to increase substantially over the coming years.  
Unemployment had fallen since 2009 and we expected it to continue to fall over the coming 
years as economic activity recovers (see Figure 6). 
CPI  inflation  was  over  3  per  cent  prior  to  the  summer.  However,  CPIF  inflation,  which 
excludes the effects of interest rate adjustments on housing costs, was just below 2 per cent 
and  even  lower  if  energy  prices  are  excluded.  Our  assessment  was  that  underlying 
inflationary pressures would gradually rise as economic activity strengthens (see Figure 7).  
Interest rate increases necessary to attain the inflation target  
Against this background, we raised the repo rate in July from 1.75 to 2 per cent. We also 
considered that the repo rate increases would need to continue in the coming period. This 
was  to  stabilise  inflation  around  the  target  of  2  per  cent  and  resource  utilisation  around  a 
normal level. The forecast for the repo rate, the repo rate path, which includes two further 
interest rate increases in autumn 2011, was therefore held unchanged. As usual, we pointed 
out that there was considerable uncertainty in the assessment of the future repo rate and that 
we  would  need  to  reconsider  the  monetary  policy  stance  if  conditions  were  to  change 
significantly (see Figure 8). 
At  the  monetary  policy  meeting  in  July  I  said  that  I  personally  believed  that  the  repo  rate 
would be raised at all three meetings this autumn, especially if the sovereign debt problems 
looked to be resolved without any major negative effects on the financial markets.1 But so far 
the management of the sovereign debt problems has not been particularly successful. I will 
come back to this. 
New statistics  
The statistics received during the summer on the Swedish economy are largely in line with 
the  assessments  we  made  in  July.  However,  the  international  outlook  appears  weaker, 
particularly  in  the  United  States.  The  statistics  refer  mainly  to  the  second  quarter  and  the 
summer months of this year, and do not actually say very much about the forecasts for the 
second half of the year and the coming years.

Weaker international developments… 
Since July, we have received preliminary national accounts figures for the second quarter of 
this year for the United States and the euro area. 
GDP  growth  in  the  United  States  was  0.3  per  cent  in  the  second  quarter  of  this  year, 
measured  as  a  seasonally-adjusted  quarterly  change.  This  was  slightly  lower  (0.1  of  a 
percentage  point)  than  we  were  expecting  in  July.  However,  the  national  accounts  for  the 
United States also contained a review of earlier figures, which shows that the decline in 2009 
was greater and the GDP level this year lower than was previously assessed (see Figure 9). 
The  labour  market  improved  in  July,  but  not  at  a  rate  that  points  to  a  good  recovery.  CPI 
inflation  in  the  United  States  remained  high  in  June  and  July,  3.6  per  cent,  which  was 
unchanged from May. Underlying inflation, excluding energy and food, was lower, but rose in 
both months to a level of 1.8 per cent in July.  
GDP growth in the euro area was 0.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2011, measured as a 
seasonally-adjusted quarterly change, which was also slightly lower (0.1 percentage point) 
than we were expecting in July. Inflation in the euro area fell from 2.7 per cent in June to 
2.5 per  cent  in  July,  when  measured  as  the  HICP.  Underlying  HICP  inflation  excluding 
energy and unprocessed foods also fell in July, to 1.5 per cent. 
At the monetary policy meeting in July I said that developments in the United States were 
troublesome.  Both  monetary  policy  and  fiscal  policy  must  be  tightened  there  in  the  longer 
run,  which  will  subdue  growth.  A  strong,  self-supporting  recovery  is  therefore  needed,  a 
recovery that does not depend on short-term cyclical policy stimulation, to ensure a tangible 
improvement in the labour market. We cannot see this type of strong growth yet. It is also a 
common pattern that a financial crisis is followed by several years of weak growth.2 I also 
noted at the July meeting that there was a tendency in the United States and Europe towards 
stagflation,  with  low  growth  and  high  inflation  at  the  same  time.  Developments  over  the 
summer reinforce this image, but this does not mean that things will necessarily continue in 
the same way. 
…but developments in Sweden largely in line with the forecasts 
In  Sweden  we  have  received  the  first  preliminary  national  accounts figures  for  the  second 
quarter of this year, and new statistics for the labour market and inflation, for instance. 
GDP  growth  was  slightly  higher  in  the  second  quarter  than  we  were  counting  on  in  July. 
Seasonally-adjusted quarterly growth came out at 1.0 per cent, against an expected 0.6 per 
cent.  Although  both  domestic  demand  and  exports  were  marginally  weaker  than  the 
Riksbank  had  forecast,  imports,  which  are  a  deduction  item  when  calculating  GDP,  were 
even weaker. This means that GDP growth was slightly higher than expected.  
I  expressed  some  concern  at  the  monetary  policy  meeting  in  July  that  the  second  quarter 
would  be  weaker  than our  forecast  in  the  Monetary  Policy  Report.  This  was  not  the  case, 
which in itself is a good thing. But at the same time, more forward-looking indicators such as 
the purchasing managers’ index and the National Institute of Economic Research’s economic 
tendency surveys point to economic activity slowing down. This is something that we have 
already  counted  on.  However,  the  purchasing  managers’  index  has  fallen  more  than 
expected, which indicates that the slowdown may be greater than estimated (see Figure 10).  
The labour force survey statistics show that the labour market continued to improve in June. 
Employment  rose  by  just  over  2  per  cent,  compared  with  the  same  month  last  year,  and 
unemployment fell, when seasonally-adjusted, to 7.5 per cent. This was a marginally smaller

improvement  than  we  were  counting  on  in  July  (unemployment  0.1  of  a  percentage  point 
higher).  
CPI  inflation  was  3.3  per  cent  in  July.  CPIF  inflation  (1.6  per  cent)  and  CPIF  inflation 
excluding  energy  (1.1  per  cent)  were  much  lower.  All  of  these  outcomes  were  marginally 
(0.1 of a percentage point) lower than expected.  
I  said  at  the  monetary  policy  meeting  in  July  that  there  was  still  a  risk  that  inflation  would 
increase  more  than  we  were  expecting,  particularly  in  2012  and  2013.  This  was  partly 
because inflation had recently been held back extra hard by the strengthening of the krona. I 
also  pointed  to  the  risk of  rising  energy  and  commodity  prices  in  the world  market,  higher 
wage increases than expected due to pressure in the labour market, and higher inflation and 
wage expectations due to the high CPI inflation.  
But  so  far,  inflation  has  been  marginally  lower  than  expected  and  energy  and  commodity 
prices have fallen. The outlook for 2012 and 2013 depends, for instance, on developments in 
international economic activity and on the result of the coming wage bargaining rounds in the 
labour market. 
The financial markets during the summer 
Developments in the financial markets have been dramatic over the summer. Share prices, 
government bond yields and exchange rates have fluctuated substantially. This turbulence is 
one factor that could have significance for future forecasts.  
This is essentially due to renewed concern over sovereign debt problems in the euro area 
and the United States. Focus has primarily been on four issues: public finances in Greece, 
the risk of problems spreading to Spain and Italy, potential problems in the European banks 
and the management of the debt ceiling and public finances in the United States. 
New support package for Greece  
At the beginning of the summer there was particular concern over developments in Greece. 
After a series of meetings of various policy-making bodies within the EU as well as a vote of 
confidence  and  a  decision  on  budget-strengthening  measures,  structural  reforms  and  the 
sale  of  state-owned  companies  in  the  Greek  parliament  it  was  decided  in  mid-July  that 
Greece would receive a further support package from the euro area and the IMF. This led to 
a  slight  fall  in  the  yield  on  Greek  government  bonds  from  their  extremely  high  levels  (see 
Figure 11). 
Spain and Italy in the danger zone 
At  the  beginning  of  August  concern  increased  that  the  problems  would  spread  to  other 
countries  than  Greece,  Portugal  and  Ireland,  who  were  already  receiving  support.  Market 
participants  focussed  on  the  sovereign  debt  situation  in  Spain  and  Italy,  which  caused 
government bond yields to rise in these countries. Both countries have problems with their 
public finances, but in different ways. Italy has a very large national debt, but not such a large 
deficit in public finances, while Spain has a smaller national debt but larger public finances 
deficit.  Both  countries  have  suffered  declining  competitiveness  over  the  past  ten  years. 
Recently, the lack of confidence has also begun to affect France. 
The banks managed the stress tests 
There is also concern that the sovereign debt problems will spread to the banking sector. On 
15  July  the  European  Banking  Authority,  EBA,  reported  the  results  of  the  stress  tests  of 
91 European banks, which together account for 65 per cent of the EU’s banking sector. This 
showed  that  all  the  banks  but  8  had  sufficient  resilience  to  manage  a  deterioration  in  the 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
scenario for the period 2011–2012, but that a further 16 banks almost did not pass the tests. 
However, all four major Swedish banks passed the stress tests with flying colours. 
The  results  were  received  with  some  scepticism,  as  they  were  not  considered  to  be 
sufficiently credible, but the markets nevertheless calmed down. European bank shares have 
since fallen, however, as a result of concern that sovereign debt problems may spread.  
US sovereign debt problems cause concern 
The sovereign debt problems in the United States have also caused concern on the financial 
markets.  This  rose  gradually  in  July  as  the  prolonged  three-way  negotiations  between  the 
parties in Congress and the President were underway. At the beginning of August, a decision 
was reached at the last minute to raise the debt ceiling and to implement greater cutbacks. 
However, these decisions did not succeed in calming the market. Standard & Poor’s lowered 
the  credit  rating  for  the  United  States  on  5  August  from  the  highest  level  of  AAA  to  the 
second  highest  level  AA+  with  a  negative  outlook.  The  other  two  dominant  credit  rating 
agencies, Moody’s and Fitch, retained their AAA ratings. The poor statistics received during 
the  summer  regarding  the  US  economy  have  further  increased  the  financial  market 
turbulence.  
Sovereign debt problems create uncertainty 
In  my  opinion,  the  public  finance  problems  in  the  United  States  have  remained  fairly 
unchanged  since  July.  The  deficit  in  US  public  finances  is  calculated  by  the  IMF  to 
correspond to around 10 per cent of GDP this year. It should not be so difficult to decide on a 
long-term  programme  that  will  bring  down  the  deficit  to  a  manageable  level  within  a  few 
years in the way Sweden did in the mid-1990s. However, the decision-making system in the 
United  States  is  constructed  in  a  way  that  makes  it  difficult  to  take  the  necessary  type  of 
decision.  Moreover,  my  impression  is  that  the  problems  with  the  public  finance  deficit  are 
underestimated in the United States to the extent that they believe growth will resolve much 
of the problems. On the other hand, they have now decided on certain budget-strengthening 
measures and the United States usually succeeds in managing difficult problems in the end.  
The  sovereign  debt  problems  in  the  euro  area  are  actually  smaller  than  the  US problems. 
The  deficit  in  public  finances  in  the  euro  area  is  calculated  by  the  IMF  to  correspond  to 
around 4 per cent of GDP this year. All in all, there is thus less need of budget strengthening 
measures in the euro area than in the United States and the tightening effects need not be 
so great. But the deficit is unevenly distributed and some countries have very large deficits 
and/or national debts. The problem is that even in Europe it appears to be difficult to reach 
decisions on credible long-term programmes for consolidating public finances. Instead, many 
countries have been forced by the markets to decide on further budget strengthening during 
the summer to increase confidence.  
However, even if the sovereign debt problems in the United States and the euro area are 
essentially  the  same,  the  market  turbulence  may  lead  to  the  situation  deteriorating.  This 
could lead to rising government bond yields and increased uncertainty regarding the future, 
and  thereby  to  lower  GDP  growth.  It  could  make  it  harder  to  rectify  the  deficits  in  public 
finances in the countries concerned. At the same time, the market turbulence would probably 
decline if one succeeded in presenting credible programmes for managing public finances. 
However, it is uncertain whether the decisions made during the summer will suffice to calm 
the markets. 
ECB buys government securities 
A further problem is that self-generating processes can arise on the financial markets. If the 
price of a particular type of asset, such as a certain country’s government bonds, falls, this 
can lead to this type of asset being sold, as those holding these assets may want to avoid 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

continued losses. This pushes the price down even further. It may be difficult to break such a 
process.  
To  avoid  this  situation  arising,  the  ECB  began  to  buy  Spanish  and  Italian  government 
securities  on  the  secondary  market  in  August,  which  has  pushed  down  interest  rates  for 
these countries. In addition, the European Council has agreed to increase the flexibility of the 
European  Financial  Stability  Facility  (EFSF).  This  facility  will  be  able  to  grant  loans  to 
governments  and  –  in  exceptional  cases  –  to  buy  government  bonds  on  the  secondary 
market. Formal approval by the respective countries is required for these changes to be able 
to come into force, and this process should move quickly. In July the euro countries signed 
an agreement to establish a permanent rescue funding programme, the European Stability 
Mechanism (ESM), which will replace the EFSF in the middle of 2013.  
Sweden has strong public finances  
In  this  context  it  is  worth  pointing out  that  public  finances in  Sweden  are  relatively  strong. 
This is partly the result of the problems we faced and succeeded in managing in the mid-
1990s. Regulations regarding expenditure ceilings, surplus targets and balance requirements 
for the municipalities have contributed to the good situation we have now. Our strong public 
finances  also  mean  that  there  is  no  need  for  the  fiscal  policy  tightening  in  Sweden  that 
several other countries will have to implement. 
Important questions at the September meeting 
The  turbulence  on  the  financial  markets  has  increased  uncertainty  regarding  international 
economic  developments  in  the  coming  period,  and  ultimately  regarding  developments  in 
Sweden. I shall conclude with a few words on the problems I consider we will thus need to 
discuss at the next monetary policy meeting in early September. 
Sweden affected through foreign trade… 
International  economic  developments  affect  developments  in  Sweden  in  two  main  ways: 
through  foreign  trade  and  through  the  financial  markets.  Exports  are  dependent  on 
developments in world trade. During the summer we have seen lower growth than expected, 
particularly  in  the  United  States.  Lower  international  growth  usually  also  leads  to  lower 
growth  in  Swedish  exports.  An  important  task  here  will  thus  be  to  assess  GDP  growth  in 
various parts of the world and what significance it has for the Swedish export market. One of 
the most difficult questions in this context is to assess how increased uncertainty abroad will 
affect international developments. 
Inflation  in  Sweden  is  also  affected  by  trade  with  other  countries,  for  instance,  when  the 
prices of goods imported into Sweden are adjusted in the world market. As I have already 
pointed out, energy and commodity prices have fallen since last spring, which we will also 
have to take into account in our inflation forecasts.  
…and via the financial markets 
The Swedish economy is also affected through the financial markets. Interest rates abroad 
have fluctuated substantially and this also affects Swedish interest rates. This is clear from 
the strong covariation between government bond yields in the United States, Germany and 
Sweden.  Developments  during  the  summer  have  entailed  falling  interest  rates  in  Sweden, 
which is in itself positive for growth (see Figure 12). 
At the same time, share prices have fallen and the stock market is very volatile. Since the 
Monetary Policy Report was published on 5 July, the Stockholm Stock Exchange has fallen 
by around 20 per cent until the beginning of this week (see Figure 13). This could mean that 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
households increase their precautionary saving and that companies postpone investments. 
We must also take a stance on how this may affect our forecasts. But then one must also 
take into account the fact that we have already counted on a significant slowdown in GDP 
growth, from around 4.4 per cent in 2011 to around 2.2 per cent in 2012, which is a much 
lower growth rate than the 3.8 per cent the government was anticipating for 2012 in its Spring 
Budget Bill.  
Economic developments in Sweden can also be  affected by developments in the Swedish 
krona. History shows that the Swedish krona usually weakens in times of turbulence, which 
was  clearly  demonstrated  during  the  financial  crisis.  One  effect  of  the  severe  krona 
weakening in 2008–2009 was that the price of imported goods rose. In this way, inflation in 
Sweden  was  stabilised;  otherwise  there  was  a  risk  that  it  would  have  been  too  low.  Even 
during the most acute phase of the crisis, CPIF inflation remained close to the target of 2 per 
cent. The krona has also weakened during the financial turbulence this summer, but so far 
the  depreciation  has  been  modest  (see  Figure  14).  We  will  also  take  into  account  the 
consequences of this in our inflation forecasts. 
At the same time, the recent financial market turbulence, with falling share prices and interest 
rates,  may  suddenly  be  reversed.  My  experience  is  that  one  should  be  cautious  in 
interpreting fresh events when one is shaping economic policy. Our repo rate decisions are 
aimed at the future. Although uncertainty has increased, and economic activity abroad so far 
has been slightly weaker, the Swedish economy has developed largely in line with the outline 
we sketched in July. Moreover, the repo rate is still low.  
Swedish banks are stable 
The Riksbank has two main tasks. The first is to conduct monetary policy with the objective 
that  inflation  shall  be  low  and  stable.  The  second  is  to  safeguard  financial  stability.  The 
Riksbank  therefore  closely  monitors  developments  in  the  financial  markets.  During  the 
summer we have extended out monitoring as a result of the international turbulence. 
Swedish banks are still financially strong. They currently have good access to funding on all 
of the markets they normally use. The Riksbank’s stress tests also show that they have  a 
good capacity to manage increased loan losses. But as the Swedish banks obtain funding 
largely  through  market  borrowing  in  foreign  currency,  they  are  of  course  vulnerable  to 
problems abroad. We currently have daily contacts with the banks and we have access to 
data on their funding. So far, there is nothing to indicate that it will be necessary for us to 
lend money to the banks. 
Next decision is on 6 September 
We  are  currently  working  hard  on  new  analyses  and  forecasts  for  the  monetary  policy 
meeting on 6 September. I have today attempted to outline events during the summer and 
the issues I consider we will discuss at our next monetary policy meeting. My colleagues and 
I will return to how this will ultimately affect monetary policy in the coming period in a couple 
of weeks’ time when our decision has been made. Moreover, we are constantly monitoring 
developments in the financial markets.
