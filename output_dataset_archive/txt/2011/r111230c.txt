Dear Guests,  
Good Afternoon!  
All  along,  the  Macao  Monetary  Authority  has  been  assiduously  helping  and  promoting  our 
financial sector to explore their business scope, which includes organizing delegations to visit 
and study set-ups overseas and on the Mainland with a view to finding suitable partners in 
business  cooperation.  I  am  honoured  to  have  been  invited  today  to  a  ceremony 
commemorating  the  Inauguration  of  Bilateral  Application  of  IC  Cards  in  Guangdong  and 
Macao and the Launching of MacauPass UnionPay Dual Currency QuickPass Cash Card. I 
am  here  to  witness  a  fruitful  result  achieved  in  the  cross-border  financial  business 
cooperation  between  Mainland  and  the  MSAR.  I  hereby  convey  my  best  wishes  to  the 
cooperation between the financial sectors of the two jurisdictions for even more fruitful results 
in the future.  
After  the  establishment  of  the  MSAR,  the  liaison  and  cooperation  between  the  financial 
sectors  of  Guangdong  and  Macao  has  been  closer  and  more  frequent.  The  trend  is 
beckoning. In 2008, the State Council promulgated the “Outline of the Plan for the Reform 
and Development of the Pearl River Delta”, in which financial cooperation was designated to 
be one of the main areas for cooperation. In March this year, the Guangdong Province and 
the  MSAR  executed  the  “Guangdong-Macao  Cooperation  Framework  Agreement”,  which 
further  promoted  the  financial  integration  of  the  two  economies  and  their  financial 
businesses. More favourable conditions for development have been created. It expands the 
scope of development for the financial business cooperation of the two places which signifies 
that the overall cooperation between Guangdong and Macao has entered into a new stage.  
Under the auspices of the Guangzhou Regional Branch and Zhuhai Branch of the People’s 
Bank  of  China  and  China  UnionPay,  the  MacauPass  issues  today  the  UnionPay  Dual 
Currency  QuickPass  Cash  Card  which  realizes  the  cross-border  use  of  the  IC  Cards  in 
Guangdong and Macao. With immediate effect, the MacauPass QuickPass Cash Card will 
be  applicable  to  ChinaUnion  terminals  located  in  both  places.  At  the  same  time,  Mainland 
residents can make use of MacauPass terminals via UnionPay QuickPass Cash Card. The 
service  has  signified  further  integration  of  financial  infrastructures  of  both  areas.  It  has 
realized the interchangeable use of stored value cards issued separately in the North region 
and  South  Region  of  the  country.  Simultaneously,  it  facilitates  small  payments  made  by

residents of Macao and tourists of the Mainland, perfecting financial services of the Mainland 
and the Macao SAR. It further embodies the gradual implementation of financial cooperation 
under the “Guangdong-Macao Cooperation Framework Agreement” by practitioners of both 
areas. It has injected fresh momentum into financial cooperation between Guangdong and 
Macao.  
We do hope that the Guangdong-Macao financial cooperation can ride the tide to strengthen 
cooperation, enhance the already fruitful results, within regulated framework and under risk 
control,  so  as  to  promote  full  economic  integration  between  Guangdong  and  Macao  and 
synchronize  infrastructures  of  both  areas.  I  hereby  would  like  to  express,  on  behalf  of  the 
Monetary Authority of Macao, our gratitude to all sectors of the community for their support in 
the  process.  Thank  you  for  your  endeavour  and  cooperation  and  our  best  wishes  to  the 
MacauPass UnionPay Cash Card for a tremendous success in their business endeavour. At 
the same time, I do hope Guangdong and Macao will continue to work shoulder to shoulder 
to  fulfil  every  item  of  financial  cooperation  under  the  “Guangdong-Macao  Cooperation 
Framework  Agreement”,  so  as  to  achieve  Guangdong-Macao  financial  cooperation  and 
secure more fruitful results in promoting appropriate diversification of the Macao economy.  
Thank you!
