Per Jansson: Some aspects of the economic situation 
Speech  by  Mr  Per  Jansson,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  Nordea, 
Stockholm, 13 March 2012. 
 Today, I will talk about the assessment of the economic situation in Sweden and abroad that 
I  and  the  majority  of  the  members  of  the  Executive  Board  made  at  the  monetary  policy 
meeting in February. At the same time, I would like to go into a little more detail about three 
aspects that were particularly important to my stance regarding the repo-rate decision. Two 
of these relate to the management of the European debt crisis and one to the risks posed to 
the Swedish economy by a low repo rate over an extended period of time. 
Those  of  you  who  have  read  the  press  release  or  the  minutes  from  the  monetary  policy 
meeting  in  February  know  that  I  voted  with  the  majority  for  a  further  repo-rate  cut  to  the 
current  level  of  1.50  per  cent.  Our  decision  to  cut  the  repo  rate  was  mainly  due  to  the 
weakening of the prospects for growth in Sweden, which in turn is a result of the impact of 
weaker economic development abroad.  
International outlook marked by the euro area’s debt crisis 
The  fact  that  economic  activity  abroad  has  weakened  recently  primarily  relates  to 
developments in the euro area. The euro countries are marked by the debt crisis and growth 
prospects  have  deteriorated  somewhat  compared  to  the  end  of  last  year  due  to  new 
consolidation measures and a tighter credit situation. There are, however, a number of bright 
spots in the US economy, where the labour market is improving and the housing market is 
showing early signs of a positive turnaround. With regard to the global economy as a whole, 
the Riksbank’s forecast is that growth will continue to increase at a relatively good rate in the 
years ahead, after having declined somewhat in 2012. This is shown in Figure 1.

For  some  time  now,  an  important  assumption  in  the  Riksbank’s  international  forecast  has 
been  that  the  euro  countries,  by  implementing  various  measures,  will succeed  in reducing 
the most acute anxiety about the debt problems in the euro area during the course of 2012. It 
is expected that this will lead to an increase in the confidence of European companies and 
households and thus to growth being able to recover towards the end of the year. I think this 
is  a  reasonable  assumption.  Recent  figures  regarding,  for  example,  the  purchasing 
managers’  index  for  the  manufacturing  industry  and  household  confidence,  indicate  that 
pessimism has declined somewhat since the end of last year. Nevertheless, the economic 
outlook for the euro area is still of course uncertain. 
Consolidation measures required 
Some of the uncertainty stems from the fact that we have still not seen the final effects of the 
fiscal  policy  tightening  that  is  now  being  implemented  by  the  governments  of  the  euro 
countries.  Some  voices  in  the  current  debate  claim  that  this  tightening  could  have  such 
negative consequences for growth that the countries concerned should wait to implement it. 
This brings me to the first aspect I would like to discuss. The fact is that I am more worried 
about  the  reverse;  that  is  that  the  countries  are  not  dealing  with  their  problems  quickly 
enough.  
At present, most of the countries in the euro area have deficits in their public finances and 
these deficits are expected to fall slowly over the next few years. Moreover, according the 
IMF’s latest assessment from January this year, the deficits are expected to fall even more 
slowly  than  was  predicted  as  recently  as  September  last  year.1  According  to  the  IMF,  the 
advanced  economies  reduced  their  cyclically-adjusted  deficits  by  an  average  of  less  than

one  percentage  point  between  2010  and  2011,  as  shown  in  Figure  2.2  These  deficits  are 
expected to fall by as much or, if you prefer, by as little, in 2012. If we look at the euro area 
separately, the reduction between 2010 and 2011 was slightly larger, that is 1.3 percentage 
points. However, it should be noted that a large part of this reduction was due to improved 
public finances in Germany and not in the countries where such an improvement is needed 
most. Despite a continued improvement during 2012, the assessment is that public finances 
in the euro area will, on average, still be in deficit. Consequently, the average level of public 
debt is expected to increase from almost 90 per cent of GDP in 2011 to 92.5 per cent in 2013 
according to the IMF. In order to reduce the level of debt instead, several European countries 
would  need  to  transform  the  relatively  substantial  deficits  of  today  into  surpluses  over  a 
period of several years.

The links that exist between the levels of debt, interest rates and growth also suggest that a 
high level of public debt entails risks. For example, a high level of debt tends to lead to higher 
long-term interest rates, as shown in Figure 3.3 A high level of debt may also lead to lower 
growth  due  to  increased  vulnerability  to  future  crises,  or  because  taxes  may  have  to  be 
increased to finance the debt.4 The higher the level of debt, the more the country must set 
aside to make the interest payments on its debts. These are a couple of the reasons why

most  studies  show  that  fiscal-policy  tightening,  or  consolidation  measures,  have  positive 
effects, at least in the longer term.

The current account shows how important it is to consolidate  
Of course, identifying an appropriate rate for budget consolidation measures is no easy task 
in  a  situation  in  which  deficits  are  large  and  growth  is  weak.  One  way  of  addressing  the 
question of when it is appropriate to consolidate is to look at the economy as a whole, not 
just  at  the  public  sector.  In  this  context,  the  current  account  is  an  important  measure  for 
illustrating  the  state  of  the  economy  in  relation  to  the  rest  of  the  world.  A  substantial  
current-account  deficit  indicates  that  domestic  expenditure  is  high  in  relation  to  domestic 
production. A current-account deficit may be due to factors that are not necessarily negative. 
However, it can also be due to domestic imbalances, for example to economic policy being 
too  expansionary.  Another  reason  may  be  that  competitiveness  is  weak,  which  dampens 
exports. In such cases, it pays for the country to try to reduce its current-account deficit by 
restraining domestic expenditure or increasing production.  
Many of the euro countries that are having problems have had both current-account deficits 
and deficits in their public finances. Probably the most effective way of reducing the deficit in 
such  cases  is  to  improve  competitiveness  and  reduce  domestic  expenditure  at  the  same 
time.  Postponing  consolidation  in  such  a  situation  would  only  entail  domestic  demand 
continuing to be higher than it should be. Figure 4 shows the current-account balance in a 
number of euro countries last year.

Like the Riksbank, most forecasters expect a tighter fiscal policy to dampen growth in Europe 
in  the  period  immediately  ahead.  It  is  difficult  to  assess  the  precise  effects  as  these  will 
depend on how and when the measures are implemented. But the measures will of course 
have an impact, particularly when several countries reduce their public spending and/or raise 
their taxes at the same time. This will happen, furthermore, in a situation in which there is 
little scope for monetary policy to further stimulate demand. But what’s the alternative? As 
the  risks  associated  with  a  high  level  of  debt  are  so  high,  it  should  be  in  the  countries’ 
interests to shoulder a greater responsibility for improving their own situation. This brings me 
to  the  second  aspect  I  would  like  to  discuss  today,  that  is  how  the  problems  of 
highly-indebted countries are handled. 
Sustainable solutions require responsibility 
It is now obvious that some European countries need support from the IMF and the EU and it 
is good that this possibility exists. However, focusing too much on various support measures 
undermines the incentives for the countries themselves to find sustainable solutions to their 
problems. I suspect that at least one reason for the comparatively weak results achieved so 
far with regard to budget consolidation and reforms at the national level is that altogether too 
much  energy  has  been  expended  on  support  facilities  and  too  little  on  what  is  needed  to 
improve the preconditions for an economically strong Europe. 
However,  I  am  not  a  fanatic  who  claims  that  budget  consolidation  is  the  one  and  only 
solution.  The  least  painful  way  to  strengthen  a  country’s  public  finances  is  to  work  with 
structural reforms that benefit the country’s economic growth. This may relate to reforms of 
the  labour  market  and  the  pension  system,  reforms  of  the  fiscal-policy  framework  and,  in 
some  cases,  fundamental  institutional  reforms.  Many  of  the  countries  that  now  have 
problems due to their weak public finances have weak economic-policy institutions and are

ranked at a relatively low level in various measures of institutional strength, for example the 
degree  of  efficiency  or  corruption  in  the  public  sector.  Figure  5  shows  examples  of  this.5 
Weak  institutions  in  themselves  undermine  the  potential  for  growth.6  By  implementing 
structural reforms, the countries can improve their public finances and increase their potential 
for growth in the period ahead. However, despite the fact that there have been and still are 
processes  in  the  EU  that  aim  to  improve  the  workings  of  the  economies  and  improve 
competitiveness, for example the Lisbon Strategy or Europe 2020, it has proved to be easier 
said than done to implement these reforms. A robust plan should therefore be based on both 
structural reforms and consolidation.

Some progress made 
In the same way as the weak performance of the European economy today is undermining 
the  economic  outlook  for  Sweden,  better  growth  potential  in  Europe  would  benefit  the 
Swedish economy going forward. Eight of Sweden’s 10 most important export markets are in 
Europe and five of them are euro countries.7 It is of course therefore gratifying that work is 
underway  at  the  EU  level  to  restore  confidence  in  economic  policy.  In  early  March, 
25 countries  signed  the  so-called  fiscal  compact,  which  entails  stricter  monitoring  of  the

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
Member  Countries’  budget  work  and  a  greater  possibility  to  impose  sanctions  on  those 
countries  that  have  excessive  debts  or  deficits.  These  are  measures  that  can  help  to 
increase the credibility of the countries’ budget discipline and reduce the risk of future debt 
crises.  Progress  has  also  been  made  in  putting  together  a  second  support  package  for 
Greece. At the same time, the decisions by the ECB in December and in February to offer 
the  banks  in  the  euro  area  three-year  loans  against  collateral  have  helped  to  stabilise  the 
situation on the financial markets. 
So, although the situation in Europe is still problematic, we can see that progress is being 
made  at  approximately  the  rate  the  Riksbank  has  estimated.  In  such  a  scenario  we  can 
expect to see a recovery in the euro area, although a weak one, over the next few years. 
Poorer performance abroad leading to slowdown in Sweden  
The weak performance in Europe at the moment is affecting the Swedish economy in several 
ways. First, the demand for Swedish exports is falling. This was also the main reason why 
growth  slowed  down  in  the  economy  at  the  end  of  last  year.  Second,  household  and 
corporate confidence in the economy is falling and this in turn is leading to a slowdown in 
consumption  and  investment.  The  financial  situation  in  Sweden  is  also  affected  by 
developments  abroad.  The  fall  in  share  prices  in  2011  reduced  the  financial  wealth  of  the 
households, which contributed to an increase in saving. It is unlikely that there will be any 
significant  decline  in  saving  in  the  period  immediately  ahead  as  the  low  level  of  growth  is 
expected to reduce employment and increase unemployment.  
Before I move on to my personal reflections on the situation in the Swedish economy, I would 
like  to  say  that  I  make  the  same  assessment  of  the  economic  outlook  in  Sweden  as  that 
made by the majority of the members of the Executive Board at the latest monetary policy 
meeting.  This  assessment  is  that  there  will  be  relative  low  inflationary  pressures and  slow 
growth in the period ahead.  
It was expected that the Swedish economy would slow down at the end of last year, but the 
slowdown  was  more  severe  than  we  believed  it  would  be.  In  the  December  forecast  the 
Riksbank  predicted  that  growth  would  decline  and  that  there  was  some  probability  of  a 
further  repo-rate  cut  in  February.  In  February,  our  assessment  was  that  the  slowdown  in 
growth  in  late  2011  had  been  even  more  severe.  This  was  because  the  indicators  for 
exports,  among  other  things,  suggested  this.  I  therefore  voted  with  the  majority  to  cut  the 
repo rate by a further 0.25 percentage points. 
Since then, we have learned that the outcome for GDP growth in the last quarter of 2011 was 
even worse than we expected at the time of the monetary policy meeting in February. This is 
largely because exports were even weaker than expected. However, we have also received 
outcomes for foreign trade in January which indicate that exports strengthened again after 
the  turn  of  the  year.  We  will  receive  further  clues  as  to  the  current  state  of  the  economy 
before  the  next  monetary  policy  meeting  in  April  and  will  then  review  how  this  new 
information affects monetary policy. 
As I said earlier, in the slightly longer term the Riksbank’s latest forecast is that there will be 
a gradual recovery in the euro area and the global economy following a weaker 2012. This 
will of course affect Sweden too. It is expected that resource utilisation will increase, the rate 
of  wage  increases  will  accelerate  and  underlying  inflation  will  gradually  rise  as  growth 
improves. The latter is illustrated in Figure 6.

that  monetary  policy  will  remain  highly  expansionary 
Low real repo rate for some time to come 
We will need to gradually tighten monetary policy when inflationary pressures and resource 
utilisation  increase.  The  Riksbank’s  repo-rate  path  from  February  therefore  indicates 
repo-rate  increases  during  the  course  of  2013  and  2014.  Nevertheless,  this  forecast  still 
means 
the  years  ahead.  
Figure 7 shows that the real repo rate is expected to be negative in 2012–2013; that is for a 
substantial part of the forecast period. If this proves to be the case, won’t there then be a risk 
of monetary policy being too expansionary? Won’t we perhaps risk overheating, a too high 
rate of inflation or an unsustainable development of household debt? 
This is of course not impossible, but at present I do not think that it is very likely. To explain 
how I have reached this conclusion I would now like to briefly summarise how I view some of 
the risks associated with a very low real interest rate.

Overheating – not a risk at present 
The first risk thus relates to resource utilisation in the economy and the risk of overheating. 
As I have already said, weak economic development abroad is having a significant impact on 
the Swedish economy. On the other hand, Sweden is in a much better initial position than 
many other countries. Sweden’s public finances are in good shape and, unlike some other 
countries; Sweden did not suffer a significant downturn on the housing market in connection 
with the financial crisis of 2008–2009. It is rather the case that the Swedish economy grew so 
quickly  during  the  major  part  of  last  year  that  there  was  a  risk  of  overheating  and  rising 
inflationary pressures. The companies reported rising labour shortages, and other measures 
of  resource  utilisation  in  the  economy  also  increased.  There  were  periods  during  the  year 
when several indicators were higher than normal. 
However,  there  has  been  a  turnaround  in  these  indicators  over  the  last  few  months. 
Company  surveys  show  that  labour  shortages  are  no  longer  as  acute  in  most  sectors. 
Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing industry has declined and is somewhat lower than 
the  historical  average.  Other  indicators,  such  as  unemployment  and  the  employment  rate, 
also point to more spare capacity than normal in the economy. My assessment was therefore 
in line with the overall analysis in the February Monetary Policy Report, that is that resource 
utilisation in the Swedish economy had declined and was below a normal level at the end of 
last year. This is shown in Figure 8. I therefore think that there is very little risk of overheating 
at the moment.

Fewer risks of high inflation 
The second risk relates to the rate of inflation. CPI inflation was high last year, which could 
have led to a substantial increase in inflation expectations and to excessive wage increases 
in the autumn round of collective bargaining. But this has not turned out to be the case, so far 
anyway.  
Long-term  inflation  expectations  have  declined  and  are  now  close  to  the  inflation target  of 
two per cent two and five years ahead. In addition, wage agreements have now been signed 
for  large  parts  of  the  manufacturing  industry.  Providing  that  the  new  wage  agreements  for 
other sectors are in line with the norm set by the manufacturing industry, it appears that total 
wage  increases  this  year  will  be  around  3.5  per  cent.  This  is  actually  a  rather  large  wage 
increase given the fact that unemployment is relatively high, but not so large that it is likely to 
lead  to  any  serious  inflation  risks.  However,  collective  bargaining  is  still  underway  and  it 
remains to be seen exactly how the results of this process will affect monetary policy.

Another relevant factor is that the rate of inflation measured in terms of the CPI has declined 
since the autumn. In August last year, CPI inflation was as high as 3.4 per cent. It has fallen 
significantly since then and in January the rate of inflation was just below 2 per cent. I expect, 
in line with the assessment in February, that CPI inflation will fall further in the period ahead 
when  the  interest  expenditure  of  the  households  increases  more  slowly.  Underlying 
inflationary  pressures  are  also  low  in  the  wake  of  a  strong  krona  and  lower  resource 
utilisation. 
Low interest rates and household indebtedness 
I  would  like  to  conclude  by  saying  something  about  my  view  of  household  indebtedness. 
However, before I discuss the last of the three risks that I associate with a low real repo rate I 
would like to clarify a matter of principle.  
I am one of those who believe that a long period with low interest rates can lead to various 
imbalances.  Such  imbalances  can arise,  for  example,  if  credit  growth  is  too  rapid,  if  asset 
prices  increase  too  much  or  if  the  price  of  financial  risk  is  set  too  low.8  Unbalanced 
development is characterised by the fact that, for one reason or another, an excessive level 
of indebtedness arises in the economy. If the economy has fallen into a recession following 
such a period, the recovery may be very slow as households and companies will spend a 
larger  part  of  their  incomes  on  amortization  payments  rather  than  on  consumption  and 
investment. The financial crisis of 2008–2009 is the latest example that clearly demonstrates

how  important  it  is  to  avoid  such  a  situation.  The  US  economy  fell  into  recession  in  early 
2008 as a result of problems on the housing market and an excessive expansion of credit in 
the  household  sector.  Four  years  later,  employment  in  the  United  States  has  still  not 
recovered  more  than  approximately  one  third of  the  fall  that  occurred during  the crisis.  To 
refer back to what I said earlier, one could say that Europe’s debt crisis is a variation on the 
theme of excessive indebtedness, although primarily for the public sector in this case.  
Figure  10  shows  how  much  unemployment  has  increased  in  several  other  countries  that 
have suffered a downturn on the housing market. I have included Sweden and the OECD as 
a whole for the purposes of comparison.

The high costs associated with reducing indebtedness in the economy means that situations 
can  sometimes  arise  in  which  there  may  be  a  desire  to  take  factors  such  as  the  level  of 
indebtedness into account in monetary policy, as well as inflation and the real economy. How 
often this actually happens depends on how effective the oversight and supervision of risks 
in the financial system as a whole are. If this so-called macroprudential supervision is less 
effective, it is probable that monetary policy must take such factors into account to a greater 
extent than otherwise.9  
After having clarified this matter of principle, I will now discuss the development of household 
indebtedness in Sweden. In 2011, the Riksbank pointed out that a gradually rising repo rate,

apart from stabilising inflation and resource utilisation, may also have the positive side effect 
of helping to slowdown household borrowing. Credit growth in the household sector, which is 
closely linked to the development of the housing market, has gradually declined since 2010. 
Household indebtedness is still high, but it levelled off last year. This suggests that the risks 
in this area are limited, at least at the moment. However, I believe that it will be important to 
monitor developments in the period ahead to check that new risks do not arise.

 Conclusions 
Today, I have discussed three aspects that were particularly important to my assessments 
and my stance when the repo-rate decision was made in February. Two of these relate to the 
debt crisis in the euro area. My view is that it is taking too long to improve public finances 
and  that  the  risks  associated  with  a  high  level  of  indebtedness  mean  that  the  debt-ridden 
countries themselves must assume a greater responsibility for resolving their problems. The 
third  aspect  relates  to  the  risks  that  can  arise  when  the  real  interest  rate  is  low  for  an 
extended period of time. This can, for example, lead to overheating tendencies or a too rapid 
increase in indebtedness. My conclusion is that, in the current situation at least, these risks 
are limited. This was one of the important reasons why I was able to vote for a repo-rate cut 
at the latest monetary policy meeting. 
A lively public debate is currently underway on a couple of the issues I have addressed here. 
This applies, for example, to the need for consolidation and which strategy is best for finding 
solutions to the debt crisis in the euro area as quickly as possible. The question of what role 
the  central  banks  should  play  in  counteracting  an  excessive  expansion  of  credit  and 
indebtedness  is  also  often  debated,  and  the  members  of  the  Executive  Board  of  the 
Riksbank  also  have  different  opinions  about  this.  I  don’t  find  this  strange  at  all,  on  the 
contrary it is entirely natural. Hopefully, this debate will contribute to constructive solutions 
going forward. 
Thank you.
