 Introduction 
Mr. President of the Senate’s Finance Commission, Senator Jose García, senators members 
of this Commission, ladies and gentlemen, 
I  appreciate  your  invitation  to  present  our  Board’s  vision  on  recent  macroeconomic  and 
financial  developments,  their  prospects  and  implications  for  monetary  and  financial  policy. 
This vision is contained in detail in our Monetary Policy Report of December 2012 and our 
Financial Stability Report of the second half of 2012. 
The year that is ending has brought good news to our economy. The inflationary fears we 
expressed  early  in  the  year  have  abated.  This  year  our  economy  will  grow  5.5  percent. 
Unemployment  is  low,  labor  income  is  growing  steadily  and  consumer  and  business 
expectations are optimistic. Investment is high by historic standards. 
A  year  ago,  when  we  presented  our  reports  to  this  Commission,  we  foresaw  that  the 
deepening of the Eurozone crisis at the time could have significant effects on our economy, 
including  a  major  slowdown  during  2012.  It  did  not.  Although  the  world  economy  froze 
significantly in the last year, other important dimensions of the external scenario, such as the 
terms of trade and international financial conditions, took a course that is favorable to us.  
Actually,  Chile’s  economic  performance  has  been  quite  different  from  that  of  many  other 
countries. The main advanced economies are still struggling with the consequences of the 
financial crisis that resulted in the world recession of 2009. They have a long road ahead to 
resolve  the  imbalances  and  weaknesses  associated  with  this  situation  before  they  can 
resume  sustained  growth.  The  Eurozone  countries  have  made  progress  in  resolving  their 
fiscal and financial problems, as well as strengthening the institutional pillars of the monetary 
union.  These  steps  have  been  welcome  by  the  markets,  but  the  efforts  must  continue. 
Achieving a solution is a slow, costly and complex process, considering the great number of 
players  involved.  There  is  also  the  ongoing  deterioration  of  the  economic  situation,  which 
only  makes  things  worse  and  complicates  the  required  adjustments.  Countries  suffering 
negative growth rates and high unemployment for too long already cannot easily implement 
new  austerity  measures.  Furthermore,  the  core  European  economies,  which  until  recently 
had been relatively spared of the recession of the peripheral countries, have begun showing 
signs of weakness. Accordingly, the risks in the Eurozone remain.  
In  the  United  States,  the  recovery  of  output  and  demand  is  weak,  insufficient  to  quickly 
absorb  its  high  unemployment.  The  Federal  Reserve  has  undertaken  to  keep  an  ultra-
expansionary  monetary  policy  in  place  for  as  long  as  this  situation  persists  and  does  not 
jeopardize inflation, which has important implications for the global financial scenario that the 
Chilean economy will continue to face in the coming years. Plus, the U.S. has a high fiscal 
deficit that reflects in an excessive increase of its public debt. If a political agreement is not 
achieved, early next year a number of automatic adjustments of taxes and expenses (the so-
called fiscal cliff) will be forced into the economy. Given the sluggish growth in this country, if 
they have to apply such major adjustments, the economy will relapse into a new recession. 
Unfortunately, when the deadline is only days away, there are no signs of agreement in sight.

The emerging world continues to outperform the developed economies, although with greater 
diversity  within  the  group.  In  China,  indicators  suggest  that  growth  is  picking  up  after  the 
deceleration of most of 2012. Latin America, meanwhile, has shown reduced growth during 
the  year  and  the  outlook  for  the  next  two  years  has  also  been  revised  downward.  The 
slowdown has been sharper in Brazil and it is not clear what the velocity of its recovery will 
be.  Mexico  and  Colombia  have  also  begun giving  signs  of  a slowdown.  Peru  continues to 
grow strongly, while Argentina is dealing with major adjustments. 
The Chilean economy has remained on an upward slope, driven by strong domestic demand 
and, particularly, fixed investment. Also, private consumption has increased in line with the 
significant  increase  in  personal  income.  Still,  we  face  significant  risks,  which  I  will  look  in 
more  detail  in  a  moment. Those  coming from  abroad  have  to  do  with  the  world  economic 
situation  I  just  described;  domestically,  they  relate  to  the  possibility  of  an  exacerbation  of 
output and expenditure.  
Beyond these risks, in the baseline scenario that today we believe to be the most likely, the 
Chilean economy will resume growth in line with the trend, while inflation will gradually return 
to levels that are consistent with the target. Let me now describe this scenario and the risks 
we have identified. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
The macroeconomic scenario facing the Chilean economy has not changed significantly in 
the past several months. As I just said, Chile’s output, and especially domestic demand, has 
grown  above  expectations.  Some  progress  has  been  made  abroad,  but  the  risks  derived 
from  the  Eurozone  crisis  are  still  present.  In  this  context,  headline  inflation  has  fluctuated 
substantially in recent months, due to one-time events associated with supply shocks. Core 
inflation – discounting foodstuffs and energy – has declined slightly to near 2 percent y-o-y. 
The Board, continuing with what has been the tone throughout the year, held the monetary 
policy interest rate at 5 percent. 
Domestic situation 
As  of  November,  y-o-y  CPI  inflation  was  2.1  percent,  after  rising  to  almost  3  percent  in 
October (figure 1). Y-o-y growth in nominal wages has remained roughly constant in the 6% 
to 7% range, although with differences across sectors.  
Output, meanwhile, grew 5.7 percent y-o-y in the third quarter of 2012, flat from the previous 
quarter,  but  more  than  expected.  The  Economic  Expectations  Survey  (EES)  of  August  – 
available at the closing of the previous Monetary Policy Report – forecast 4.6 percent growth 
for said quarter. The greater increase was due to better performance in general. However, 
output’s velocity of expansion dropped from 8.3 to 5.7 percent annualized.  
In the baseline scenario, the Board estimates that GDP will grow 5.5 percent this year. This 
projection is higher than the ceiling we estimated in September, with a similar revision as has 
been made in private forecasts. Still, both our forecasts and private ones have experienced 
sustained upward revisions in the past year (figure 2). 
On the domestic spending side, third quarter growth (i.e. 8.0 percent y-o-y) largely surpassed 
second-quarter figures, however swollen by some specific factors. While every component of 
expenditure  posted  higher  increases,  the  large  increase  in  machinery  and  equipment 
investment  is  worth  noting:  19.9  percent  y-o-y.  The  acceleration  of  domestic  spending 
amplified the negative current account balance, which in the third quarter went to 2.9 percent 
of the GDP accumulated in the last year. The baseline scenario assumes that the deficit will 
end the year 2012 at 3.8 percent of GDP, exceeding September’s forecast of 3.2 percent. 
Meanwhile,  the  national  financial  system  has  operated  normally  in  a  context  of  strong 
investment and favorable external credit conditions. Household credit has continued to grow 
2 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
in tandem with disposable income, although the increase in loans by non-bank suppliers – 
with a higher penetration in lower-income households – has been smaller than in previous 
periods.  Corporate  debt  has  grown  somewhat  above  GDP,  driven  by  strong  local  banking 
credit  and  external  financing  via  bonds,  in  a  context  of  favorable  financing  conditions  in 
international  markets.  In  turn,  the  banking  system  keeps  robust  indicators,  with  capital 
significantly above regulatory levels, a more diversified external funding base, and a stable 
liquidity position.  
Toward  2013,  the  Board  estimates  that  GDP  growth  will  be  within  the  range  of  4.25  to 
5.25 percent. This range is above the one foreseen in September. In this scenario, domestic 
demand  will  increase  5.7  percent  y-o-y,  further  amplifying  the  current  account  deficit  to 
4.6 percent  of  GDP.  This  projection  supposes  that  macroeconomic  conditions  facing  the 
Chilean economy will remain fairly unchanged in the near future, and that the economy will 
grow  in  line  with  trend  rates,  which  the  Board  continues  to  estimate  around  5  percent 
(table 1). 
Internationally, the baseline scenario foresees that in 2013 and 2014 the world economy and 
Chile’s trading partners will grow by averages of 3.6% and 3.8%, respectively, not far from 
those  of  2011–2012.  Important  differences  remain  between  the  performances  of  the 
developed world and the emerging world. The recession in the Eurozone has settled and is 
expected  to  last  some more time.  Expectations  regarding  the  United  States  are  that  it  will 
continue to recover at a slow pace, and that moderate adjustments to the fiscal policy  will 
take place. The downgraded outlook for Japan needs mention, due to both its relation with 
the  Eurozone  and  some  fiscal  adjustment  measures  foreseen  for  2014.  In  the  emerging 
world,  incoming  data  from  China  suggest  that  the  slowdown  of  most  of  2012  may  be 
reverting.  Thus,  again  y-o-y  growth  rates  around  8  percent  are  forecast  for  the  Chinese 
economy for 2013 and 2014. Growth prospects for Latin America are revised downward for 
this and the next two years.  
In this scenario, commodity prices will not change much from forecasts a few months back. 
In  the  two-year  period  2013–2014,  the  baseline  scenario  foresees  average  prices  of 
US$3.45 per pound of copper and US$102 per Brent oil barrel. Accordingly, terms of trade 
estimates for Chile continue to be high, but lower than they were this year (table 2). 
External financial markets have shown some calm these months. However, as I noted at the 
beginning, there is still a long way ahead before the Eurozone crisis can be resolved.  The 
commitment of various organizations to work out a solution seems to be bearing fruit in the 
market’s  evaluation.  Anyway,  the  baseline  scenario  again  considers  the  possibility  of  new 
stress episodes in the world markets. Such greater calm has also reflected in stock markets 
and currency parities. In recent months, the U.S. dollar has depreciated slightly against the 
main currencies. The peso/dollar parity, with ups and downs, is somewhat lower than in the 
previous  Monetary  Policy  Report,  while  the  real  exchange  rate  (RER)  has  shown  no 
significant  variation.  The  Board  continues  to  estimate  that,  with  the  prevailing  nominal 
exchange  rate  and  currency  parities,  the  RER  is  in  the  lower  part  of  the  range  of  values 
consistent with its long-term fundamentals (figure 3). 
In  the  baseline  scenario,  y-o-y  CPI  inflation  will  stand  below  the  tolerance  range  in  the 
coming  months,  to  start  rising  later  and  approach  3%  by  the  end  of  2013  and  over  the 
projection horizon, this time the last quarter of 2014. There are several factors explaining the 
lower  figures  foreseen  for  the  near  future,  including  the  high  basis  for  comparison  of  late 
2011 and the turn of 2012. Core inflation will post y-o-y variations below 2% over most of 
2013, then it will rise gradually to near 3% over the course of 2014 (figure 4).  
This  path  assumes  that  wages  will  grow  in  line  with  productivity  and  target  inflation.  In 
addition,  it  relies  on  the  methodological  assumption  that,  over  the  projection  horizon,  the 
RER will be fairly unchanged from its recent values. Finally, the baseline scenario uses as a 
working  assumption  that  the  MPR  trajectory  will  be  stable,  as  suggested  by  the  latest 
surveys available at the statistical closing of this Monetary Policy Report (figure 5).

The baseline scenario reflects those events that are believed to be the most likely with the 
information at hand at the closing of this Report. There are risk scenarios, however, which if 
materialized, may reshape the macroeconomic environment – in some cases, significantly – 
and therefore, may alter the course of monetary policy. On this opportunity, having evaluated 
the  alternative  scenarios,  the  Board  estimates  that  the  risk  balance  is  unbiased  for  both 
output and inflation. 
In the world economy, the main risk continues to be the situation in the Eurozone. On 
one  hand  are  the  difficulties  in  implementing  agreements. On  the  other,  like  I  said,  as 
time has passed, the economic situation of the most affected countries has complicated 
further,  while  core  European  economies  seem  to  be  taking  a  turn  for  the  worse.  A 
sharper deceleration in Germany or France could aggravate the problems in the region 
and amplify pass-through channels to other economies. Neither can this analysis rule out 
episodes of volatility in the financial markets that could  be more severe than the  ones 
considered in the baseline scenario.  
However, the potential effects on Chilean banks of a deepening of the crisis in the Eurozone 
are  still  bounded.  While  banks’  profitability  and  solvency  indicators  have  dropped  most 
recently, stress tests show that the banking system’s level of capital is appropriate to absorb 
the losses caused by a risk scenario of this kind. 
Another  risk  is  the  ongoing  discussion  in  the  United  States  to  ward  off  a  sharp  fiscal 
adjustment  in  2013.  Failure  to  reach  an  agreement  could  significantly  hamper  growth  and 
increase market volatility.  
And central banks of developed economies have continued to boost, and even intensify, very 
expansionary  monetary  policies,  which  can  bring  consequences  on  capital  flows,  asset 
prices,  currency  parities,  commodity  prices  and  credit  growth  in  the  other  economies, 
including Chile. So far the domestic effects of these policies have been limited, but they are 
certainly a source of concern. 
Finally, in the emerging world, the biggest risk continues to be the pace of economic activity. 
Incoming data indicate that China has resumed strong growth, but the weakening of Europe 
and pending discussions in the United States could affect the Chinese economy, and through 
it  the  emerging  world.  Chile  would  be  especially  affected  because  of  its  incidence  in  the 
determination of the copper price. In addition, the recent drop in world trade growth figures is 
cause for concern.  
In Chile, despite particularly low inflation, medium-term inflationary risks remain present. The 
sustained dynamism of Chile’s economic activity has intensified the use of installed capacity, 
and  a  strengthening  of  domestic  demand  could  trigger  inflationary  pressures  incompatible 
with the inflation target. So far, inflation has remained bounded and has even decreased. Our 
evaluation is that the recent drop is a transitory event that will be gradually reversed within 
the next few quarters to return to levels around the Central Bank’s target. Behind its recent 
performance  there  may  have  been  factors  such  as  compressed  trade  margins,  increased 
mean  labor  productivity  and  lower  prices  of  imported  goods.  However,  these  are  typically 
procyclical factors, so it is quite possible that their effects are transitory. With this uncertainty, 
one must not overlook the medium-term inflationary risks of a more dynamic trajectory of the 
economy. 
A more dynamic domestic demand could also amplify the deficit of the current account of the 
balance  of  payments  and  increase  the  economy’s  external  vulnerability,  eventually 
confronting  it  with  costly  potential  adjustments.  The  Board  pays  close  attention  to  the 
evolution  of  the  current  account  deficit.  Its  level,  persistence,  composition  and  funding 
sources are all aspects that may affect the vulnerability of the Chilean economy, particularly 
if confronted with adverse external scenarios. 
However, the current deficit has several peculiarities that mitigate the associated risks. First, 
a  significant  part  is  explained  by  higher  investment  in  a  number  of  projects  aimed  at  the 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
production  of  exportable  goods  and  services.  Second,  a  major  part  of  the  deficit  is  being 
financed  via  foreign  direct  investment  rather  than  external  debt.  Finally,  the  evolution  of 
domestic and external credit is showing no signs of overborrowing by either households or 
firms. Accordingly, the evolution of private consumption does not divert far from the increase 
in  labor  income,  the  low  rate  of  unemployment  and  financial  conditions.  Similarly,  from  a 
longer  perspective,  in  nominal  terms,  the  ratio  between  private  consumption  and  private 
national disposable income is close to its historic average. 
Overall,  an  increase  in  the  current  account  deficit  could  entail  unwanted  risks,  which  is 
particularly  important  in  a  context  where  sudden  changes  may  occur  in  macroeconomic 
conditions, which could precipitate difficult adjustments to the national economy. In the past, 
most  of  the  crises  that  the  country  endured  were  preceded  by  high  and  persistent  current 
account  deficits,  an  excessive  increase  in  borrowing,  and  important  currency  mismatches. 
However,  today’s  economic  policy  framework  is  more  advanced,  including  a  rule  that 
governs  fiscal  policy  and  cushions  the  impact  on  public  expenditure  of  both  copper  price 
fluctuations around its long-term trend and the ups and downs of the business cycle. It also 
includes a floating exchange rate regime that puts currency risks under the light allowing an 
early  response  to  sudden  changes  in  external  conditions.  And  it  contemplates  proper 
financial regulation and supervision to prevent the incubation of excessive risk. Accordingly, 
the Board estimates that it is paramount to closely monitor those factors that are behind the 
current  account  deficit,  in  order  to  avoid  the  incubation  of  imbalances  that  may  affect  the 
future performance of the economy. 
Another risk factor we have identified is the dynamic of the real estate sector. In mid year, we 
called  the  attention  to  the  evolution  of  real  estate  prices,  with  a  focus  on  some  districts. 
Today, seeing that some of those trends have deepened and widened, we need to return to 
this topic. As we have noted and is now part of public debate, during the last few quarters 
real  estate  prices  have  been  steadily  increasing  in  some  districts  and  for  some  types  of 
construction (table 3). Aggregate prices of office space also continued to grow, but less than 
did residential prices. 
In  the  residential  sector,  the  sales  of  houses  and  apartments  have  risen  substantially, 
especially  in  blueprint  or  catalog  stage,  indicating  some  shortage  in  the  short-term  supply 
(figure 6). In the commercial sector, although the available vacancy indicators are still low, 
private real estate firms continue to forecast significant growth in the supply of office space 
for this purpose. 
Although  such  price  increase  can  find  justification  in  its  macro  and  microeconomic 
fundamentals,  it  must  be  monitored  closely.  These  price  increases  have  occurred  in  a 
context of high growth in housing demand and a significant expansion in output in the sector, 
accompanied with higher leverage among real estate firms. Meanwhile, and because of the 
stage of the supply-demand cycle the residential real estate sector is in now, an acceleration 
of mortgage credit in the medium term cannot be ruled out. It must also be kept in mind that 
the lending standards for these credits have eased somewhat, which reflects in an increase 
in the fraction of the property price that is lent (figure 7).  
This  type  of  developments  could  create  vulnerabilities  in  the  real  estate  and  construction 
industry, or in those households searching for a new home. It is also worth noting that the 
current combination of higher property prices, low long-term interest rates, favorable lending 
standards and higher volatility of other financial asset categories, configure a scenario that 
could  motivate  an  increase  in  financial  investment  in  the  sector,  potentially  exacerbating 
these risks.  
Therefore, we have stressed how important it is that agents consider these risk factors when 
evaluating their investment and lending decisions in the sector. In particular, these decisions 
need to bear in mind that past price increases are no guarantee of further increases in the 
future. We believe that raising this type of alert, thus increasing the amount of information 
available for risk assessment, is part of our role of promoting the normal functioning of the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 5 
financial system. We believe that the extended discussion that has taken place on the topics 
of the real estate sector is extremely valuable. 
Another  risk  factor  requiring  close  attention  is  the  evolution  of  medium-sized  banks. 
Recently,  credits granted  by  these  banks  have  increased faster than those  of  other  banks 
(figure 8). There is certainly a positive side to it, as it implies lower concentration of risks in 
the system. However, its growth dynamic could become a source of vulnerabilities. On one 
hand, because of higher exposure both to those sectors more closely linked to the business 
cycle and to individual debtors who, faced with a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions 
could be severely affected. On the other hand, because of the higher relative growth of roll-
over  consumer  credit  (i.e.,  credit  cards  and  credit  lines).  This,  because  of  the  possible 
underestimation of the risk that these products may cause, as they allow for sharp increases 
in  borrowing  that  may  affect  repayment  ability  without  a  timely  reflection  in  the  borrower’s 
payment  behavior.  Finally,  and  as  has  been  noted  before,  the  greater  reliance  of  some 
midsized  banks  to  wholesale  funding  makes  them  more  vulnerable  to  episodes  of  greater 
difficulties in bank lending.  
As already noted, the present scenario depicts significant risks that call for policy responses 
in different directions. The MPR is within the range of values considered neutral. However, 
from  the  policy  makers’  perspective,  the task  of dealing  with  the  challenges  posed  by  this 
type of risks goes beyond the scope of monetary policy, and requires the concurrence and 
coordination  of  a  broader  set  of  macroeconomic  and  financial  policies.  Actually,  some  of 
these  risks  (e.g.,  those  relating  to  the  current  account  deficit  and  the  just  mentioned  real 
estate sector) can be observed even in a situation where inflation remains bounded and in 
line with the target. 
At  the  international  level,  we  have  seen  growing  interest  in  the  use  of  macroprudential 
measures. This concept covers a significant number of possibilities, some of which are the 
direct decision of the central banks while others rely on other authorities. For example, the 
potential risks that could be generated in the real estate sector have driven some regulators 
and  supervisors  elsewhere  to  use  a  series  of  prudential  instruments  to  safeguard  the 
financial system and reduce the sector’s volatility. Worth mentioning are the limits to the loan 
to  value  ratio,  the  limits  to  the  ratio  between  debt  and  income,  changes  in  the  credit  risk 
weighting, and capital requirements. The particulars of these measures vary from country to 
country,  but  normally  more  than  one  of  them  applies  and  entails  coordination  of  several 
authorities. Because of its short history, a full evaluation of the results is yet to be done. The 
Financial Stability Board, created one year ago in Chile, is a proper instance of coordination 
to analyze these issues. 
In  any  case,  the  Board  follows  closely  the  evolution  of  the  external  and  domestic 
macroeconomic scenarios and their implications on inflation, and reiterates its commitment to 
conduct monetary policy in such a way that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy 
horizon,  as  well  as  to  continue  to  closely  monitor  any  risk  factors  that  could  affect  the 
financial stability of the country.  
Let me finish with some reflections. 
Final reflections 
The Chilean economy is in a good standing. The results we have obtained in the last year 
have been quite better than the world’s average and much better than we projected a year 
ago. But there is still a long road ahead before we achieve the stage of development we all 
wish  for.  Besides,  the  present  situation  poses  significant  risks.  Coordination  with  every 
organization in charge of policies is critical to succeed in meeting this challenge. 
If  the  economy  continues  to  grow  above  trend,  or  spending  exceeds  our  true  possibilities, 
especially  in  some  sectors,  some  imbalances  may  be  incubated  that  may  generate 
significant  vulnerabilities  and  require  costly  adjustments  going  forward.  Our  history  has 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
taught us how difficult these adjustments can be, and we must do everything in our power to 
avoid  revisiting  these  situations.  More  so  considering  that  these  events  hit  the  most 
vulnerable population hardest. 
As I have said on previous opportunities, Chile enjoys a high international reputation in many 
circles.  The  laudatory  words  about  our  economy  recently  uttered  by  the  IMF’s  Managing 
Director  attest  to  that.  Our  country  stands  out  for  its  soundness,  its  good  macroeconomic 
management and the functioning of its institutions. This is an important asset, especially in a 
small  country  geographically  distant from  economic  centers,  so that  should  be  valued  and 
nurtured. 
Our duty is to protect this reputation and conduct policies that allow maintaining sustainable 
development of the economy economic aiming to achieve greater welfare of our country. Our 
contribution as the Central Bank is to keep inflation low and stable. Also to help, within the 
scope  of  our  powers,  to  identify  and  deal  with  any  risks  that  may  jeopardize  the  normal 
functioning of our financial system. 
Thank you.
