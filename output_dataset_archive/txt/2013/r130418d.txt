Ryuzo Miyao: Economic activity, prices, and monetary policy 
Speech by Mr Ryuzo Miyao, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at a meeting 
with business leaders, Gifu, 18 April 2013. 
 Introduction 
Thank  you for giving  me  this  opportunity to  exchange  views  with  people  representing Gifu 
Prefecture, who have taken time to be here despite their busy schedules. Allow me to also 
express my gratitude for your cooperation with the activities of the Bank of Japan’s Nagoya 
Branch.  
Today,  I  will  review  economic  activity  and  prices  in  Japan,  whose  economy  has  stopped 
weakening and has shown some signs of picking up, and then discuss the Bank’s monetary 
policy. My concluding remarks will touch briefly on the economy of Gifu Prefecture. Following 
my speech, I would like to listen to your views on the actual situation of the local economy 
and to your candid opinions.

Recent developments in economic activity and prices 
Economic activity through the end of 2012: firms’ defensive stance 
A.  
I would like to begin by looking back at developments in overseas economies and Japan’s 
economy over the past few years, through the end of 2012. The following two developments 
can be highlighted as the main features of this period. 
First, the outlook for overseas economies had been highly uncertain due to their prolonged 
deceleration.  Even  though  several  years  had  passed  since  the  Lehman  shock,  overseas 
economies remained unable to emerge from the phase of post-crisis adjustment; that is, the 
chronic economic downturn. Subsequently, these economies were struck by multiple waves 
of significant shocks, including the worsening of the European sovereign debt problem and 
concern  about  a  potential  disintegration  of  the  euro,  as  well  as  a  delayed  recovery  in  the 
employment situation and the fiscal problem in the United States. As a result, investors’ risk 
aversion and preference for safe assets heightened in global financial markets, and the yen’s 
appreciating  trend  continued.  The  downturn  in  overseas  economies  was  also  reflected  in 
developments in the world economic growth rate (Chart 1). 
Second,  reflecting  such  severe  conditions  in  overseas  economies  and  global  financial 
markets, business activities in Japan, particularly fixed investment, became cautious. With a 
high  degree  of  uncertainty  regarding  the  outlook,  Japanese  firms  focused  on  taking  a 
defensive  stance,  holding  back  or  postponing  fixed  investment  while  maintaining  relatively 
high profits and internal reserves (Chart 2). At the same time, stock prices and the potential 
growth rate of Japan’s economy also remained depressed (charts 3 and 4). 
It  must  be  noted  that  the  continuation  of  such  a  defensive  stance  can  cause  deflationary 
sentiment to become firmly fixed and impair the economy’s growth potential. In order to make 
Japanese firms shift from such an excessively defensive stance and allow the economy to 
regain  its growth  potential,  it  is  essential to  put forward  various  regulatory  and  institutional 
reforms as well as a wide range of investment, such as in capital and human resources. 
In this regard, it is encouraging to see that Japanese firms’ growth expectations and appetite 
for fixed investment have been maintained. For example, according to the Cabinet Office’s 
Annual  Survey  of  Corporate  Behavior  (Fiscal  2012),  firms’  forecasts  for  real  growth  rates 
over the next three and five years, respectively, were at a level exceeding 1 percent and also 
above  the  current  potential  growth  rate,  which  is  estimated  to  be  in  the  range  of  
0–0.5 percent.  Moreover,  with  business  fixed  investment  plans  remaining  solid,  postponed

investment projects are likely to have accumulated considerably, indicating that firms’ growth 
expectations remain resilient. 
Furthermore, business sentiment has started to pick up and corporate profit prospects have 
begun to improve, triggered by the correction in the yen’s appreciation and the rise in stock 
prices since the end of 2012. Although uncertainty regarding the world economy still exists, 
serious tail risks such as a potential disintegration of the euro have receded and the outlook 
for  overseas  economies  has  been  on  an  improving  trend.  Reflecting  these  developments, 
firms are gradually beginning to enjoy an environment in which they can show their “animal 
spirits” – that is, their entrepreneurship – and carry out business fixed investment. 
Japan’s economy: showing some signs of picking up 
B.  
In  these  circumstances,  Japan’s  economy  has  finally  stopped  weakening  and  has  shown 
some signs of picking up. Overseas economies remain in a deceleration phase on the whole, 
but the U.S. and Chinese economies are heading toward a pick-up. In this situation, Japan’s 
exports  have  stopped  decreasing.  As  for  domestic  demand,  business  fixed  investment 
continues to show some weakness on the whole, as the result of investment that is weak in 
manufacturing and solid in nonmanufacturing. In contrast, public investment has continued to 
increase, and housing investment has generally been picking up. Private consumption has 
been  increasingly  resilient.  Reflecting  these  developments  in  demand  both  at  home  and 
abroad, industrial production has stopped decreasing and has shown some signs of picking 
up. 
With regard to the outlook, Japan’s economy is expected to return to a moderate recovery 
path, mainly on the assumption that domestic demand will remain resilient, partly due to the 
effects  of  various  economic  measures,  and  that  growth  rates  of  overseas  economies  will 
gradually pick up. To elaborate on this, exports are expected to pick up, led by the recovery 
in  the  U.S.  and  Chinese  economies.  As  for  domestic  demand,  it  is  expected  that  public 
investment  will  continue  trending  upward,  supported  by  the  effects  of  various  economic 
measures,  and  that  housing  investment  will  continue  to  generally  pick  up.  Resilience  in 
private consumption is expected to increase gradually, assisted mainly by an improvement in 
consumer sentiment. Business fixed investment – a crucial factor of domestic demand – is 
projected  to  remain  somewhat  weak  for  the  time  being  in  manufacturing,  but  follow  a 
moderate increasing trend thereafter, partly due to investment related to disaster prevention 
and energy. In these circumstances, it is anticipated that production will pick up. 
Japan’s economy is thus expected to gradually pick up. However, uncertainties remain over 
the  economic  outlook,  such  as  downside  risks  associated  with  overseas  economies,  and I 
am paying greater attention to the downside risks. 
Meanwhile, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items 
less  fresh  food  has  been  slightly  negative,  due  to  the  reversal  of  the  previous  year’s 
movements  in  durable  consumer  goods.  As  for  the  outlook,  it  is  likely  to  remain  slightly 
negative in the short run. This is because over the next few months, while weak economic 
recovery  in  2012  would  put  downward  pressure  on  prices,  upward  pressure  from  factors 
such  as  the  depreciating  trend  of  the  yen  is  likely  to  be  offset  by  the  downward  pressure 
brought  about  by  the  reversal  of  the  rises  in  prices  of  televisions  and  crude  oil  in  2012. 
However,  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI  is  expected  to  return  to  around 
0 percent, as the downward pressure caused by the reversal of price rises in 2012 subsides, 
and then become positive, assuming that the negative output gap narrows accompanied by a 
recovery in the economy. 
Path toward achieving the 2 percent price stability target 
C.  
I  will  next  discuss  the  outlook  for  the  somewhat  longer  term.  In  January  2013,  the  Bank 
decided to introduce the “price stability target” and take a decisive step forward to enhance 
monetary easing with the aim of achieving this target at the earliest possible time. One of the 
2 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
main reasons behind this decision is that it has become possible to envisage the path toward 
reaching the 2 percent target, in a situation where the achievement of 1 percent inflation in 
fiscal  2014  has  come  into  sight  in  terms  of  the  median  of  the  Policy  Board  members’ 
forecasts of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI. 
In  what  follows,  I  present  a  baseline  scenario  for  the  path  toward  achieving  the  2  percent 
price  stability  target, focusing  on  several  specific  points. In  creating  a future  scenario,  it  is 
necessary  to  take  into  account  various  factors,  but  I  place  particular  importance  on  the 
following points. 
First,  the  world  economy  is  expected  to  stabilize  and  grow  through  2014.  The  latest 
projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) show that the growth rate of the world 
economy  will  increase  gradually  to  around  4  percent  through  2014  on  an  annual  basis.  In 
these projections, cautious views on the European economy are maintained, as represented 
by the forecast for 2013 of slightly negative growth, while steady recovery is expected in the 
U.S. economy and emerging economies in Asia. 
Second,  as  the  world  economy,  especially  the  U.S.  economy,  recovers  steadily,  it  is  likely 
that investors’ risk-taking will continue to be active – the so-called risk-on – as a trend and 
that  U.S.  long-term  interest  rates  will  rise  moderately.  These  factors  will  underpin  the 
demand for risk assets as well as affect foreign exchange rates by putting pressure on the 
U.S. dollar to appreciate against the yen. 
Third,  demand  for  business  fixed  investment  in  Japan,  which  has  been  restrained,  will 
emerge as the world economy moves toward normalization and thereby reduces associated 
uncertainty. Developments since the end of 2012, such as an upturn in business sentiment 
and projected improvement in corporate profits, together with the effects of monetary easing 
by the Bank, will probably encourage firms to make positive efforts. 
Fourth,  the  potential  growth  rate  of  Japan’s  economy  is  likely  to  increase  moderately. 
Productivity  will  improve  if  business  fixed  investment  is  made  and  obsolete  facilities  and 
factories are replaced by ones equipped with new technologies. Moreover, if institutional and 
regulatory reforms are conducted in fields such as agriculture, energy, and medical care with 
a  vigorous  trade  policy  implemented,  then  efforts  to  strengthen  the  growth  potential  and 
competitiveness of the economy will progress further. In view of these prospective factors, it 
is reasonable to expect a moderate increase in the potential growth rate, which seems to be 
in the range of 0–0.5 percent at present. 
Fifth,  the  public’s  inflation  expectations  will  likely  rise  gradually.  These  expectations  are 
affected by developments in actual inflation rates, the medium- to long-term trend of inflation 
rates, and the prospects for economic recovery. It is not unrealistic to assume a rise in the 
public’s  inflation  expectations  if  deflationary  sentiment  is  dispelled,  the  actual  inflation  rate 
rises, and prospects for sustainable economic recovery become widely acknowledged under 
the 2 percent price stability target, together with the effects of monetary easing by the Bank. 
Let  me  briefly  summarize  what  I  have  covered.  The  path  toward  achieving  the  2  percent 
price  stability  target  can  be  described  as  follows  (Chart  6).  First,  the  normalization  of 
overseas  economies  will  bolster  the  recovery  trend  in  Japan’s  exports  and  production, 
thereby increasing corporate profits. Second, the continued risk-on trend and gradual rise in 
U.S.  long-term  interest  rates,  as  well  as  strong monetary  easing  by  the  Bank,  will  support 
accommodative  financial  conditions,  reflected  even  in  asset  prices  and  foreign  exchange 
rates.  Third,  this  will  encourage  firms’  positive  initiatives  to  make  fixed  investment  and 
implement structural reforms, which  will  in turn bring a gradual rise in the potential growth 
rate of Japan’s economy. Fourth, on the expectation of sustainable economic recovery, firm 
household  spending  should  be  maintained  and  prices  should  gradually 
increase 
accompanied  by  the  narrowing  of  the  negative  output  gap.  Fifth,  the  public’s  inflation 
expectations will rise gradually, and in this situation the inflation rate is likely to rise above 
1 percent during fiscal 2014 – more specifically, as of January 2013, the median of the Policy 
Board  members’ forecasts  of  the  year-on-year rate  of  change  in the  CPI for fiscal  2014  is 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 3 
0.9 percent. And sixth, thereafter, in a situation where the virtuous circle of a five-stage path 
is maintained, economic recovery will be sustained and the public’s expected rate of inflation 
and the medium- to long-term trend inflation rate will likely increase further toward 2 percent. 
As a result, the actual inflation rate is projected to continue to rise, approaching the 2 percent 
price stability target. As illustrated, the 2 percent target will likely be achieved as the inflation 
rate rises in balance with a sustainable economic recovery. 
It should be noted that, during the 2003–2006 period, Japan experienced the same virtuous 
circle as the path I have just described. During this period, the prospect of resolving banks’ 
nonperforming-loan  problem  almost  came  into  sight,  and  with  the  tailwind  of  recovery  in 
overseas economies, there was progress in firms’ efforts to make arrangements to resolve 
the  “three  excesses,”  in  employment,  capital  stock,  and  debt,  as  well  as  in  efforts  to 
implement  structural  reforms  and  spend  on  new  investment.  These  efforts  were  strongly 
supported  from  the  financial  side  by  policies  implemented  at  that  time,  such  as  decisive 
monetary easing policy – namely, quantitative easing policy. Subsequently, the medium- to 
long-term trend inflation rate rose (charts 1–5). In short, during the 2003–2006 period, Japan 
experienced  a  virtuous  circle  of  recovery  in  overseas  economies,  aggressive  monetary 
easing, progress in structural reforms, a rise in the potential growth rate of the economy, and 
an increase in the medium- to long-term expected rate of inflation. 
Looking  back  at  price  developments  during  that  period,  prices  were  under  downward 
pressure, mainly from the effects of adjusting excess labor, or reducing labor costs, and the 
inflow  of  inexpensive  imported  goods.  Consequently,  prices  did  not  rise  sufficiently  to 
overcome  deflation.  This  time,  however,  strong  negative  shocks  to  prices  are  unlikely  to 
occur in addition. Therefore, if the virtuous circle I mentioned earlier does indeed begin to 
operate, prices are likely to swing upward. 
II.  
Monetary policy 
Conduct of monetary policy 
A.  
Let me now discuss the Bank’s efforts to enhance monetary easing. At the Monetary Policy 
Meeting (MPM) held on April 3 and 4, 2013, the Bank decided to introduce the “quantitative 
and qualitative monetary easing” in order to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in 
terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI at the earliest possible time, with a time 
horizon of about two years. Specifically, the Bank’s monetary easing consists of the following 
measures (Chart 7). 
First, with a view to pursuing the quantitative monetary easing, the Bank decided to change 
the  main  operating  target for  money  market  operations from  the  uncollateralized  overnight 
call rate to the monetary base. On this basis, the Bank will conduct money market operations 
so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 60–70 trillion yen. 
Second, with a view to putting downward pressure on interest rates across the yield curve, 
the  Bank  decided  to  increase  its  purchases  of  Japanese  government  bonds  (JGBs)  and 
extend their maturity. That is, the Bank will purchase JGBs so that their amount outstanding 
will increase at an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen. In addition, the Bank decided that 
JGBs with all maturities including 40-year bonds will be made eligible for purchase, and the 
average remaining maturity of the Bank’s JGB purchases will be extended from slightly less 
than three years at present to about seven years – equivalent to the average maturity of the 
amount outstanding of JGBs issued. 
Third,  with  a  view  to  lowering  risk  premia  of  asset  prices,  the  Bank  decided  to  purchase 
exchange-traded  funds  (ETFs)  and  Japan  real  estate  investment  trusts  (J-REITs)  so  that 
their amounts outstanding will increase at an annual pace of 1 trillion yen and 30 billion yen, 
respectively.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
Fourth, the Bank decided to continue with the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing, 
which consists of the above measures I have just explained, with the aim of achieving the 
price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a 
stable manner. The Bank will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity 
and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate. 
Fifth, the Bank decided to terminate the Asset Purchase Program and temporarily suspend 
the so-called banknote principle as it implements these measures. 
These measures are very drastic, and I would like to point out the main features, as follows. 
First,  the  Bank  fundamentally  reconstructed  the  framework  of  monetary  policy,  bearing  in 
mind the importance of clearly communicating to the markets and the public its aggressive 
monetary  easing  stance  to  achieve  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent.  To  this  end,  the 
Bank first made a clear commitment to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the 
earliest possible time, with a time horizon of about two years, and as a new framework for 
achieving  this  target,  it  introduced  a  new  guideline  for  money  market  operations  with  the 
monetary base set as the main operating target. 
Second,  the  Bank  had  previously  been  strengthening  its  monetary  easing  gradually  while 
examining the effects of easing. This time, however, it took all possible measures that were 
considered necessary at present. 
Third, the Bank took very drastic measures both in terms of the scale (quantity) and contents 
(quality) of its asset purchases. On the quantity side, the Bank will double the monetary base 
in two years – that is, it will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will 
increase at an annual pace of about 60–70 trillion yen. The Bank will more than double the 
amount outstanding of its JGB holdings – an item that accounts for the largest part of the 
Bank’s  balance  sheet  expansion  –  by  purchasing  JGBs  at  a  level  such  that  their  amount 
outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen. As a result, the Bank will 
be purchasing JGBs on an exceedingly  large scale: the monthly flow of JGB purchases is 
expected to exceed 7 trillion yen on a gross basis, which is an amount equivalent to about 
70 percent of the monthly average of newly issued JGBs (Chart 8). On the quality side, the 
Bank  will  more  than  double  the  average  remaining  maturity  of  JGB  purchases  in  order  to 
exert  stronger  influence  on  longer-term  interest  rates  in  general.  In  addition,  it  will  almost 
double the pace of ETF purchases to further lower risk premia of asset prices (Chart 9). 
It should be noted that the Bank decides and assesses at the MPMs paces of increase in the 
monetary base as well as JGB and ETF purchases on an annual flow basis, and if calculated 
on a stock basis, the monetary base and the amounts outstanding of JGBs as well as ETFs 
will  double  in  two  years.  The  ratio  of  the  monetary  base  to  nominal  GDP  is  expected  to 
increase to about 57 percent by the end of 2014. This not only stands out above the other 
advanced  economies,  but  also  is  more  than  three  times  larger  than  the  ratio  before  the 
Lehman shock. 
The Bank is fully aware that its massive JGB purchases and provision of the monetary base 
far  exceed  market  expectations.  Therefore,  it  is  vital  to  have  the  cooperation  of  market 
participants, such as counterparties’ active bidding in the Bank’s market operations. In this 
regard, the Bank has set up forums for enhanced dialogue with those market participants in 
order  to  exchange  views  pertaining  to  money  market  operations  and  market  transactions 
more  generally.  As  part  of  such  attempts,  it  held  the  first  meeting  for  the  purpose  of 
exchanging views with market participants last week. 
B.  
Issues to be considered regarding the quantitative and qualitative monetary 
easing 
I  will  next  present  my  views  on  several  issues  regarding  the  quantitative  and  qualitative 
monetary easing I have just mentioned. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

Why was the monetary policy framework changed at this time? 
1.  
Ever since the price stability target of 2 percent was introduced in January 2013, I have been 
submitting a proposal for additional monetary easing – in the belief that it was necessary to 
demonstrate  the  Bank’s  firmer  determination  to  achieve  the  target  at  the  earliest  possible 
time – stating that “The Bank, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in terms 
of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI, will continue with a virtually zero interest rate 
policy until it judges the achievement of the price stability target to be in sight. By doing so, 
as  well  as  continuing  with  purchases  of  financial  assets,  the  Bank  will  further  pursue 
aggressive monetary easing.” At the same time, I also considered it necessary to change the 
framework of monetary policy, mainly because of the following. First, the operational burden 
of  the  Asset  Purchase  Program  was  increased,  as  seen  in  the  frequently  occurring 
undersubscription in the Bank’s fixed-rate funds-supplying operation against pooled collateral 
under  the  program.  Second,  if  the  Bank  were  to  purchase  longer-term  JGBs  in  order  to 
reduce  such  burden,  this  would  require  the  consolidation  of  JGB  purchases  conducted 
through  the  program  with  those  conducted  for  facilitating  money  market  operations. 
Moreover,  my  consideration  was  that,  if  the  Bank  were  to  go  so  far  as  to  change  the 
monetary policy framework, the most effective timing would be after the installation of new 
leadership at the Bank. Through the discussion made at the April 3–4 MPM, I reached the 
conclusion  that  the  measures  for  large-scale  JGB  purchases  and  their  maturity  extension 
were expected to generate stronger monetary easing effects than the proposal I had been 
submitting, in that they would further put strong downward pressure on the entire yield curve. 
Taking into account the associated costs and risks – which I will touch upon later – I voted for 
the introduction of the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing. 
2.  
The assumed transmission channels under the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing 
are  as  follows.  The  large-scale  JGB  purchases  will  create  several  transmission  channels: 
(1) a  channel  to  influence  the  entire  yield  curve;  (2)  one to  influence  asset  prices  such  as 
stock  prices  and  real  estate  prices;  (3)  one  to  induce  portfolio  adjustments  by  banks  and 
institutional investors, such as increased demand for lending and risk assets; and (4) one to 
exert  influence  on  inflation  expectations.  These  channels  are  closely  interrelated.  For 
example, the first channel triggers the second and third channels, while the second and third 
channels reinforce each other (Chart 10).1 
The main developments that are expected to occur through the channels I have mentioned 
are  as  follows.  Through  the  first  channel,  firms’  and  households’  borrowing  costs  will  be 
reduced. Through the second channel, there will be a rise in firms’ capital raising and fixed 
investment,  as  well  as  in  households’  consumption  and  net  exports.  Through  the  third 
channel, there will be a shift from investment in government securities to banks’ credit and 
investment in risk assets. Through the fourth channel, real interest rates will decrease and 
thereby underpin spending activity in the economy. As a result, we ultimately could expect to 
see positive effects transmit to developments in economic activity and prices. 
3.  
In relation to the transmission effects I have just described, the measures decided at the April 
3–4 MPM emphasize the influence on “expectations.” I will explain what these “expectations” 
mean. There are three types to consider. 
What kinds of transmission channels are assumed? 
What do we mean by “expectations”? 
                                                
1   As  a  derivative  of  the  third  channel,  we  could  expect  a  transmission  channel  through  an  “international 
spillover.” Specifically, as a result of international portfolio adjustments, if an inflow of funds occurs in foreign 
countries, such as through foreign bond investment, and revitalizes overseas economies, this would feed back 
as benefits to the domestic economy through a rise in demand overseas and an increase in profits of globally 
active firms. 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
The first type is expectations for future monetary policy. The measures decided at the MPM 
presented the prospects for paces of increase in the monetary base and JGB purchases, as 
well  as  the  time  frame  for  continuing  these  actions.  These  in  turn  will  increase  the 
predictability  of future  polices,  and  thereby  enhance  the  overall  effects of  the  transmission 
channels I have mentioned. 
The second type is inflation expectations, which I pointed out in my earlier reference to the 
fourth transmission channel. 
The third type is expectations for a virtuous circle. Specifically, this refers to the expectations 
that a virtuous circle of future sustainable economic recovery and a rise in the inflation rate 
will  emerge,  as  developments  through  the  transmission  channels  become  visible.  As  I 
described in the first half of this speech, if the scenario of aiming to achieve 2 percent CPI 
inflation will gradually materialize in line with the intended path, the public will actually sense 
this development and raise its level of confidence regarding the economic activity and price 
outlooks.  Consequently,  spending  will  increase  due  to  a  rise  in  expectations  for  income 
increases, together with a rise in the inflation rate and inflation expectations, which will in turn 
underpin and strengthen the virtuous circle of the economy as a whole. 
Taking  account  of  each  of  these  three  aspects,  I  consider  it  important  to  influence 
expectations. 
4.  
Why was the main operating target for money market operations changed to the 
monetary base? 
Under the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing, indicators that represent the direction 
of overall quantity could be the monetary base, the outstanding balance of current accounts 
at  the  Bank,  and  the  size  of  the  Bank’s  balance  sheet.  Among  them,  the  monetary  base 
represents  the  amount  of  currency  the  Bank  directly  supplies  –  namely,  the  sum  of 
banknotes in circulation and current account balances at the Bank – and is a clear concept in 
economics.  The  Bank  judged  it  appropriate  to  introduce  the  monetary  base  as  the  main 
operating  target  for  money  market  operations  in  order  to  communicate  its  policy  stance 
clearly to the markets and the public as well as to enhance policy effects. 
Generally  speaking,  when  the  “quantity,”  such  as  the  monetary  base,  is  used  as  a  policy 
variable,  controlling  quantity  could  cause  interest  rates  to  fluctuate  to  some  extent.  The 
framework introduced at the April 3–4 MPM is highly distinctive in that it involves not only the 
control over the increase in the amount of currency, but also the decision on the purchases 
of financial assets such as JGBs and risk assets. In short, the new framework simultaneously 
pursues  two  channels:  the  general  transmission  channel  triggered  by  low  interest  rates 
resulting  from  large-scale  JGB  purchases;  and  the  channel  exerting  influence  on  inflation 
expectations by introducing control over the amount of currency. In doing so, the framework 
aims to convey a strong message to overcome deflation and further enhance policy effects.2 
Let me note that, under this framework, the Bank becomes able to conduct more flexibly the 
operations for short-term assets, excluding JGBs and risk assets. As downward pressure will 
be put on the entire yield curve, interest rates with short-term maturities are likely to remain 
at very low levels. 
5.  
Under  the  price  stability  target,  the  Bank  has  made  a  commitment  to  achieving  2  percent 
inflation at the earliest possible time. It is not the case that the price stability target is fulfilled 
Until when will the new monetary policy be continued? 
                                                
2  
In  the  United  States,  in  the  1979-1982  period,  an  operating  procedure  of  controlling  monetary  aggregates 
called “non-borrowed reserve” targeting was adopted in order to curb high inflation at that time. This measure 
is considered to have played a role in conveying a strong message to eliminate high inflation by going so far 
as to change the operating procedure with the aim of achieving the objective of addressing the issue. As a 
result, inflation was curbed.

Are risks and costs considerable? 
once  the  targeted  inflation  is  achieved  at  a  single  point  in  time.  Rather,  it  is  necessary  to 
maintain  the  targeted  level  in  a  stable  manner.  Therefore,  with  a  view  to  clarifying  this 
purpose, the new framework is indicative of the Bank’s commitment that it will continue with 
the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 
2  percent,  as  long  as  it  is  necessary  for  maintaining  that  target  in  a  stable  manner.  This 
means  that,  even  if  the inflation  rate reaches  2 percent  at  one  point,  if  the  Bank judges  it 
necessary to maintain that situation in a stable manner, it will continue the quantitative and 
qualitative monetary easing, while the opposite is also true. Having said this, I believe that 
the Bank decided at the April 3–4 MPM all the necessary measures to meet its commitment 
to  achieving  the  2  percent  price  stability  target  at  the  earliest  possible  time,  with  a  time 
horizon of about two years. 
6.  
It  is  true  that  the  quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary  easing  entails  some  risks.  The 
markets  may  become  unstable  temporarily  if  risk-taking  by  some  investors  becomes 
excessive. The risks to the Bank’s balance sheet will increase, and it might take considerable 
time to exit from the monetary easing. However, I believe that the quantitative and qualitative 
monetary easing is indispensable to achieving the price stability target at the earliest possible 
time.  Taking  into  account  Japan’s  current  situation  of  protracted  deflation,  this  measure 
should be pursued as long as benefits are considered to exceed costs, even if various risks 
are entailed. 
In the course of pursuing this measure, with a view to ensuring sustainable recovery in the 
economy,  the  Bank  will  carefully  examine  risk  factors  such  as  market  conditions  and 
developments in economic activity and prices. 
On  this  point,  in  the  statement  released  on  April  4,  2013,  it  is  noted  that  the  Bank  will 
examine  both  upside  and  downside  risks  to  economic  activity  and  prices,  and  make 
adjustments  as  appropriate.  This  contains  the  ideas  presented  in  the  statements  released 
after the previous MPMs and in the joint statement with the government that the Bank will 
ascertain  whether  there  is  any  significant  risk  to  the  sustainability  of  economic  growth, 
including from the accumulation of financial imbalances. The change of expression does not 
imply that the need to perceive risks has been reduced. 
7.  
At  the  April  3–4  MPM,  the  Bank  decided  to  temporarily  suspend  the  so-called  banknote 
principle until it achieved the price stability target. However, it is not necessary to repudiate 
the underlying concept of the principle that the amount of banknotes in circulation – namely, 
the Bank’s long-term liabilities – should be backed by the purchasing of JGBs – that is, long-
term  assets.  I  understand  that  the  Bank  should  resume  the  purchases  in  line  with  the 
banknote principle in the future. 
In  order  to  prevent  concerns  over  fiscal  dominance  from  arising  following  the  temporary 
suspension of the banknote principle, it is important for the government to ensure the market 
credibility  of  its  stance  toward  achieving  fiscal  consolidation.  In  this  regard,  in  the  joint 
statement  by  the  government  and  the  Bank  released  in  January,  it  is  clearly  stated  that,  in 
strengthening  coordination  between  the  government  and  the  Bank,  the  government  would 
steadily promote measures aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure with a view to 
ensuring  the  credibility  of  fiscal  management.  I  strongly  expect  that  such  efforts  will  make 
steady progress. 
8.  
The decisions made at the April 3–4 MPM have great significance. Under the framework of 
“comprehensive  monetary  easing,”  which  had  been  adopted  for  the  past  two  and  a  half 
years,  the  Bank  had  been  strengthening  monetary  easing  through  various  unconventional 
measures while examining the effects of such easing. This has contributed to underpinning 
Japan’s economy, but the economy has failed to exit from a period of deflation. 
Is the alternative to the “banknote principle” necessary? 
Summary of recent policy decisions 
8 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
It should be noted that, because of this experience of the comprehensive monetary easing, 
the Bank could decide on a new policy of the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing at 
the April 3–4 MPM. It is true that the decision, which includes the purchases of JGBs on such 
an unprecedented scale, entails a certain degree of risk, but I am sure that this will produce 
effects that would more than offset such a risk. The Bank will strongly pursue the quantitative 
and qualitative monetary easing in order to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent at 
the earliest possible time, with a time horizon of about two years. 
At the same time, if regulatory and institutional reforms as well as economic growth policies 
implemented by the government make progress and the growth potential of the private sector 
increases, this  will  further  enhance  the  effects of  the quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary 
easing. Initiatives in such areas are steadily being undertaken, and I have great expectations 
that further progress will be made. 
Concluding remarks: the economy of Gifu prefecture 
My concluding remarks will touch on the economy of Gifu Prefecture. 
In my view, monozukuri, or manufacturing, has long been a prosperous and key industry in 
Gifu Prefecture. For example, the proportion of workers in the manufacturing sector accounts 
for  24.1  percent,  which  is  the fifth  highest  level  in  Japan.  The  current  main  manufacturing 
industries  include  transportation  equipment  such  as  motor  vehicle  parts  and  aircraft, 
electronic parts such as integrated circuit packages, and general machinery such as machine 
tools  as  well  as  molds  and  dies.  At  the  same  time,  traditional  local  industries  prevail 
throughout the prefecture, including (1) knives made in Seki City, which is recognized as the 
hub  of  Japanese  cutlery  production;  (2)  Mino  paper,  one  of  the  best  known  types  of 
Japanese paper, which is famous for its quality; (3) Mino ceramic ware, which accounts for 
about  half  of  the  dishware  produced  in  Japan;  and  (4)  Ichii  Ittobori,  yew  wood  carvings 
characterized by a fine grain. I believe that one characteristic of the prefecture is that such 
traditional  craftsmanship  has  been  passed  on  to  current  manufacturing  industries  –  for 
example, of fine ceramics and health food such as royal jelly. 
In  addition  to  this  accumulation  of  traditional  industries,  Gifu  Prefecture  enjoys  favorable 
geographical  conditions.  Situated  in  the  center  of  Japan,  it  has  good  access  in  terms  of 
transportation and distribution not only to the Tokai region, but also to the Tokyo metropolitan 
area and Kansai region. In recent years, an extension of the expressway network, including 
the  Tokai-Kanjo  Expressway,  has  further  improved  its  accessibility.  The  prefecture’s  other 
strengths are its hard ground, the low risk of tsunami, and its bountiful freshwater resources. 
Due  to  such  advantages,  the  number  of  new  factories  in  the  prefecture  has  been  ranked 
among the highest levels in Japan, at fourth and eighth place in 2011 and 2012, respectively. 
Investment in distribution centers is also prominent, with signs of remarkable future progress 
becoming evident.  
Through efforts to make use of these characteristics and advantages, as well as foster new 
areas with growth potential, I expect that further progress will be made in the prefecture with 
monozukuri. 
The  Hida  region,  especially  Takayama  City,  is  well  known  as  an  international  tourist 
destination that attracts a number of visitors not only from Japan but also overseas. This is 
the  result  of  strenuous  efforts  made  throughout  the  community,  such  as  advertising 
campaigns  overseas  to  invite  tourists,  a  helpful  visitor  information  center,  informative 
brochures,  and  multilingual  signposts.  From  2011  to  2012,  the  number  of  tourists  from 
abroad  dropped  because  of  the  accident  at  the  Fukushima  nuclear  power  plant  and  the 
developments  in  relations  between  Japan  and  China.  However,  international  tourists  have 
been  coming  back  of  late.  I  expect  that  efforts  to  attract  tourists  both  from  Japan  and 
overseas will further promote development of the tourist industry in the region.

The Bank will continue to provide support as much as possible as the central bank, so that 
efforts in each economic sector of the prefecture will pay off.

 Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) 
(Chart 7) 
   
1. Adoption of the monetary base control 
 
● The monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 60-70 tril. yen. 
 
2. Increase in JGB purchases and their maturity extension 
 
● With a view to encouraging a further decline in interest rates across the yield 
curve,  the  Bank  will  purchase  JGBs  so  that  their  amount  outstanding  will 
increase at an annual pace of about 50 tril. yen. 
● JGBs with all maturities will be made eligible for purchase, and the average 
remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be extended from slightly 
less than 3 years to about 7 years -- equivalent to the average maturity of the 
amount outstanding of JGBs issued. 
 
3. Increase in ETF and J-REIT purchases 
 
 
● With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices, the Bank will purchase 
ETFs and J-REITs so that their amounts outstanding will increase at an annual 
pace of 1 tril. yen and 30 bil. yen, respectively. 
 
 
4. Continuation of the QQE 
 
● The Bank will continue with the QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability 
target of 2%, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable 
manner. 
● The Bank will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity 
and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate.
