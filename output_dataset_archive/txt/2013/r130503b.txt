Mario Draghi: Short address on the occasion of the launch of the Europa 
series €5 banknote 
Speech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at the launch of the 
Europa series €5 banknote, Bratislava, 2 May 2013. 
 I mentioned this at the end of today’s press conference, but let me say again that I’m very 
pleased  to  be  here  today  to  see  the  launch  of  the  new  5  euro,  the  first  banknote  of  the 
Europa series.  
The  new  banknote  will  join  15  billion  euro  notes  already  in  circulation.  They  are  the  most 
visible and tangible symbol of European integration, used from one end of the continent to 
the other. With the Europa series, we are giving a face to our currency. A portrait of Europa, 
a figure from Greek mythology, has been incorporated into some of the security features of 
the new series.  
After centuries of division, the European Union was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year 
for its contribution to “the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human 
rights in Europe”.  
We all know that Europe is experiencing some challenging times. Governments and citizens 
are making extraordinary efforts to put their economies on a sounder footing and to build a 
more stable future for the European Union. In times like these, it’s important to remember 
what  the  Union  and  the  euro  have  achieved  and  what  they  mean  in  the  longer  term, 
especially for young people.  
The children who are here today are growing up in a continent of peace. They belong to the 
“euro generation” – they have only known one currency. We invited them to attend a photo 
event with the Governing Council this morning. We are happy for them to be with us on this 
occasion to mark the launch of the next generation of euro banknotes.
