Charles Bean: Rebalancing 
Speech by Mr Charles Bean, Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy of the Bank of England, 
at  the  Official  Monetary  and  Financial  Institutions  Forum  Golden  Series  Lecture,  London, 
29 May 2013. 
 Good morning! It is almost six years since the onset of the Global Financial Crisis and almost 
four years on from the trough of the recession that followed the collapse of Lehman’s. Yet 
despite  highly  stimulatory  monetary  policies,  we  are  still  a  long  way  short  of  seeing  a  full 
recovery in the advanced economies. Here, output remains some 2½% below its pre-crisis 
peak,  while  in  the  euro  area  the  shortfall  is  even  larger  at  3¼%.  And  even  in  the  United 
States, where the recovery is further advanced, output is just 3¼% above its pre-crisis peak, 
well below where one might have expected on the basis of past cyclical recoveries. 
That sluggishness in the recovery reflects the fact that, unlike a normal cycle, substantial real 
adjustments are also required in our economies. These include not only the repair of over-
extended  balance  sheets,  especially  in  the  banking  sector,  but  also  the  need  to  shift  the 
composition of demand and production towards more sustainable patterns. And these shifts 
require  changes  not  only  in  the  indebted  countries,  but  also  corresponding  shifts  in  the 
pattern  of  demand  and  production  in  other  countries.  To  what  extent  are  these  changes 
under way? 
Let me begin with our own rebalancing challenge, here in the United Kingdom. The pre-crisis 
decade was generally one of steady growth and inflation close to the target, and thus few 
signs  of  overheating  in  the  real  economy.  Domestic  demand  nevertheless  consistently 
outstripped  the  supply  of  output,  generating  a  small  but  persistent  current  account  deficit, 
averaging  around  2%  of  GDP.  MPC  members  noted  on  several  occasions  that  this  would 
have to be corrected at some stage, and would most probably need to be accompanied by a 
lower sterling real effective exchange rate.1 
Such a rebalancing process appeared to have been set in train by the deterioration in the 
outlook and the rise in uncertainty associated with the financial crisis. Household spending 
collapsed, as the saving ratio rose from around 1-2% to around 7%, with much of the rise 
accounted for by the behaviour of highly indebted households (Chart 1); businesses' capital 
spending  also  fell  sharply,  though  that  is  something  we  would  like  to  have  seen  more  of, 
rather  than  less.  At the same time,  sterling fell by  a  quarter. That  should  have  given  us  a 
head start in crowding in net exports to replace the lost domestic demand. The performance 
of  net  exports  has,  however,  been  distinctly  underwhelming,  adding  just  1½  percentage 
points to total growth since the start of the recession. That is not simply a reflection of the 
weakness  in  our  export  markets,  as  the  weakness  at  home  has  depressed  imports 
correspondingly.  Once  one  controls  for  the  changes  in  activity  at  home  and  abroad,  net 
exports still look weak. 
Imports  and  exports  of  goods  have,  however,  behaved  pretty  much  as  expected.  For 
example, the decline in our share of the market for exports of goods appears to have been 
halted (Chart 2). The real disappointment has instead been in exports of services, where our 
market  share  –  which  had  been  rising  strongly  before  the  crisis  –  has  flattened  off,  rather 
than accelerating. A large part of that reflects a decline in the demand for financial services 
globally as a result of the crisis, but that alone is not sufficient to explain the weakness. Along 
with the surprising robustness of employment, the disappointing performance of net trade is 
yet another puzzling aspect of this particular downturn. One possibility is that the lags have

been  elongated,  perhaps  because  heightened  uncertainty  has  inhibited  the  necessary 
investment to move into new markets. If that is the case, then net exports can be expected to 
perform  better  as  recovery  here  and  abroad  proceeds.  But  another  possibility  is  that  the 
demand for, and supply of, exports have become less responsive to relative price signals, 
perhaps reflecting the nature of the goods and services we have a comparative advantage 
in. That would imply a less optimistic outlook. 
Let me now venture further afield, to the euro area. The euro area is by far our largest trading 
partner  –  accounting  for  getting  on  for  half  our  exports  –  and  those  direct  links  are 
supplemented  by  close  financial  ties  between  our  domestic  banking  system  and  the 
continent.  So  it  is  hardly  surprising  that  recent  Inflation Reports  have  singled  out 
developments in the euro area as a key risk to the UK outlook. 
Although the euro area has been in rough current account balance since the introduction of 
the euro, there have of course been substantial intra-zonal imbalances. In the run up to the 
crisis,  periphery  countries  ran  persistent  current  account  deficits  financed  in  large  part  by 
borrowing  from  core  countries,  especially  Germany.  As  a  result,  the  net  international 
investment position of Spain has deteriorated by around 60% of (annual) GDP since 2000, 
while for Greece and Portugal the number rises to around three quarters of GDP (Chart 3). 
On the other side, Germany’s net international investment position has improved by around 
40% of GDP. 
Initially  these  imbalances  were  seen  as  the  benign  consequence  of  an  underdeveloped 
periphery catching up with a richer core. But on top of that were less benign influences. First, 
perceptions  of  supply  potential  in  the  periphery  appear  to  have  been  over-optimistic; 
subsequent revisions to the IMF's estimates of spare capacity bear witness to that (Chart 4). 
Second,  credit  conditions  loosened  substantially,  supported  by  a  sharp  compression  in 
perceived long-term risk-free rates, which was only unwound when markets began re-pricing 
in the risk of bank and sovereign default in the periphery (Chart 5). The decline in interest 
rates  in  the  periphery  in  the  pre-crisis  period  suggests  that  it  was  a  case  of  capital  being 
pushed  into  the  periphery,  rather  than  it  being  sucked  in  by  a  high  rate  of  return  as 
conventional  analysis  would  suggest.  The  consequence  of  all  this  was  an  increase  in 
demand in the periphery, much of it in construction, financed by borrowing from the core. 
This is illustrated in the contrasting experiences of Spain and Germany. Domestic demand in 
Spain  consistently  outstripped  output  growth  pre-crisis,  while  the  opposite  was  true  in 
Germany  (Chart  6).  These  growing  external  imbalances  were  accompanied  by  increasing 
internal  imbalances,  as  the  non-tradable  sector  in  Spain  expanded  at  the  expense  of  the 
tradable sector, driving up unit labour costs in the former relative to the latter (Chart 7). That 
was not the case in Germany.2 
Restoring  the  euro  area  to  strong  and  balanced  growth  requires  dealing  not  only  with  the 
accumulated  financial  imbalances  –  the  excessive  banking  and  sovereign  debts  in  the 
periphery – but also restoring competitiveness and rebalancing the structure of demand and 
production. On the face of it, that rebalancing is under way, with a narrowing in the current 
account deficits of the periphery. Chart 8 indicates, however, that much of that is attributable 
to the substantial fall in imports associated with the collapse in domestic demand, rather than 
a rise in exports (although to the extent that there was excess demand before the crisis – as 
Chart 4 suggests – part of that decline in imports will be warranted). 
Moreover, the necessary sectoral reallocation of resources is harder to achieve in a currency 
union than in a country with its own currency, as the exchange rate is not free to adjust to 
expedite the necessary adjustments in prices and quantities. Absent a supply-side miracle to 
                                                
2  As productivity tends to rise faster in manufacturing than services, unit labour costs on average rise faster in non-tradables 
than tradables. But, as Chart 7 makes clear, the gap was much greater in Spain than Germany.

raise productivity in the periphery, the necessary reversal in the movements in relative unit 
labour costs needs instead to come about through wage and price adjustment, which may 
require a sustained period of spare capacity in the periphery together with excess demand in 
the core. 
There is, however, an inherent asymmetry, noted long ago by Keynes, that when credit flows 
dry up, adjustment is compulsory for the debtor but only voluntary for the creditor. Moreover, 
not only does the creditor lack the urgent need to adjust, they may also feel that the debtor 
ought  to  bear  more  of  the  burden  of  adjustment  on  moral  grounds.  Consequently  the 
pressure for austerity is greater in the periphery, than it is to boost demand in the core. So, 
while  the  euro-area  authorities  have  been  making  substantial  progress  in  constructing  the 
economic architecture to support the monetary union, the adjustment process taking place in 
the periphery is nevertheless likely to continue to weigh on euro-area demand prospects for 
some time. And that will also act as a headwind to the recovery here in the United Kingdom. 
Let me turn finally to the global picture. During the build-up to the financial crisis, significant 
international  payments  imbalances  emerged  (Chart  9).  On  one  side  were  the  advanced 
economies, most especially the United States, running large and persistent current account 
deficits. On the other side were the emerging economies – most notably in Asia – and latterly 
the oil exporters, showing large current account surpluses. In the decade prior to the financial 
crisis, for  example,  the US  current  account  deficit  widened  from  under 2%  of  GDP  to  5%, 
while the surplus in China rose from 4% of GDP to 10%. 
That  constellation  of  international  payments  flows,  with  emerging  economies  exporting 
capital  to  advanced  economies,  was  the  opposite  of  what  conventional  economic  models 
would  predict.  Normally  one  would  expect  countries  in  the  catch-up  phase  of  economic 
development  with  temporarily  high  investment  levels  to  import the  necessary  savings from 
overseas. But a combination of limited household safety nets and under-developed domestic 
financial markets generated unusually high private savings rates. In addition, some emerging 
economy  governments  engaged  in  the  accumulation  of  foreign  reserves,  in  order  both  to 
sustain  export-led  development  and  to  insure  against  sudden  capital  outflows  of  the  sort 
seen in 1997–8. So capital flowed uphill, rather than downhill as in the euro area. Moreover, 
there was a strong desire to hold these savings in safe assets, such as US Treasuries. 
The counterpart to this “savings glut” was downward pressure on the interest rates on those 
safe  assets  in  the  advanced  economies.  Faced  with  these  lower  returns  on  safe  assets, 
investors  then  sought  to  generate  higher  returns  in  other  ways,  including  packaging 
securities in ways that appeared to combine yield with safety. And a long period of benign 
economic outcomes – the Great Moderation – lulled investors into a false sense of security. 
The consequent buoyancy in asset prices and easy availability of credit then helped sustain 
demand.  But  all  this  came  to  an  end  when  investors  realised  the  true  nature  of  their 
exposures, leading to a scramble for safety, a drying-up of credit and a sharp reduction in 
spending by households and businesses. 
This analysis focuses on the net capital flows between countries, but in passing it is worth 
noting that gross capital flows can be just as, if not more, important.3 The pre-crisis leveraged 
search for yield resulted in an unprecedented expansion of debt within and across countries' 
financial  systems  (Chart  10).  Much  of  this  “banking  glut”4  can  be  traced  to  the  advanced 
economies: for example, around half of the gross inflows into the United States just before 
the crisis came from European institutions, rather than emerging economies.5

Now global capital flows of this nature can be valuable. They help to oil the wheels of the 
international  financial  system,  allowing  saving  to  flow  to  where  it  can  be  most  effectively 
used. They allow banks to diversify across national boundaries, reducing their susceptibility 
to  idiosyncratic  domestic  shocks.  And  they  increase  the  degree  of  competition  within  the 
domestic  banking  market.  But  by  increasing  the  linkages  between  financial  systems,  they 
can also increase systemic vulnerabilities. In this case, banks became dependent on short-
term  funding  from  overseas,  rather  than  their  traditional  domestic  deposit  base.  When 
investors  re-trenched,  that  funding  dried  up  and  banks  struggled  to  find  viable  alternative 
sources  of  funding.  Ensuring  gross  capital  flows  are  not  excessive  is  just  as  important  as 
avoiding excessive net capital flows. 
Moving  to  a  sustainable  equilibrium  requires  a  narrowing  in  the  international  payments 
imbalances.  And  we  have  indeed  seen  such  a  narrowing  since  the  start  of  the  crisis.  For 
instance,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  expects  a  current  account  deficit  in  the 
United States of just under 3% of GDP this year, while the Chinese surplus is expected to 
have fallen to around 2½% of GDP. But, as with the euro area, the crucial question is how 
much of this narrowing is simply a reflection of the cyclical weakness in the deficit economies 
or  whether  it  represents  a  more  durable  shift  in  the  pattern  of  demand  in  both  deficit  and 
surplus economies. If it is down to the former, then the imbalances can be expected to re-
emerge as recovery proceeds. 
The  answer  to  this  question  depends  very  much  on  the  degree  to  which  the  substantial 
shortfall,  relative  to  pre-crisis  trends,  of  activity  in  the  deficit  economies  represents  a 
permanent impairment of supply potential as a result of the financial crisis and subsequent 
recession,  or  whether  it  will  ultimately  be  reversed.  Successive  Inflation  Reports  and 
speeches by several MPC members6 have addressed this issue in the context of the United 
Kingdom, and I think it is fair to say that the evidence is presently inconclusive. 
Chart  11  provides  an  assessment,  drawing  on  IMF  analysis,  of  the  evolution  of  structural 
deficits and surpluses for two alternative scenarios, with the red dashed line corresponding to 
an assumption that supply impairment in the advanced economies as a result of the crisis is 
minimal (and therefore output gaps are correspondingly large), whereas the blue dashed line 
– which corresponds to the IMF’s central case – assumes a relatively high degree of supply 
impairment (and therefore substantially smaller output gaps). In the former case, the bulk of 
the post-crisis narrowing in imbalances is attributed to cyclical factors, whereas in the latter 
they are attributed to structural factors. Clearly, depending how one reads the data, one can 
arrive at a different conclusion. 
An alternative  way into this is to look at what has happened to relative prices, rather than 
quantities. A natural counterpart of a rotation in demand from the advanced to the emerging 
world should be a fall in the real exchange rates of the former and a rise in those of the latter. 
By increasing the profitability in deficit countries of producing internationally tradable goods 
and  services  relative  to  that  of  non-tradables,  that  should  facilitate  the  necessary  shift  of 
resources  between  sectors.  The  opposite  is  true  for  the  emerging  economies.  Chart  12 
shows such a shift has taken place since before the crisis, with both sterling and the dollar 
depreciating in real terms, and the renminbi appreciating. So there is evidence that at least 
some of the necessary structural adjustment has taken place, though in all likelihood it still 
has further to run. 
What sorts of policies would facilitate the required adjustment without relying on sustained 
weakness  in  the  indebted  countries?  At  Pittsburgh,  in  2009,  the  G20  identified  five 
ingredients. First, surplus countries should take steps to boost domestic demand. Second, 
deficit countries should implement credible strategies to support private savings and restore 
fiscal  sustainability.  Third,  exchange  rates  need  to  be  allowed  to  reflect  underlying 
                                                
6 See for instance: Broadbent (2012), Miles (2012) and Dale (2013).

fundamentals. Fourth, financial regulation and supervision should be strengthened to prevent 
the re-emergence of financial sector excesses. Fifth, structural reforms should be pursued, 
not only to boost long-term growth but also potentially to boost demand in the short run. 
This sounds straightforward, but why has it in practice proved so difficult to achieve?  First 
and  foremost,  the  actors  have  not  always  shared  the  same  diagnosis  of  the  underlying 
problems. Second, in circumstances like the present, when there is still a significant margin 
of  spare  capacity  in  many  economies,  an  expansion  in  activity  in  one  country  generates 
beneficial spillovers onto other countries (the opposite would be the case if there was excess 
demand and overheating). But policy makers typically do not take account of these spillovers 
when  judging  how  much  to  stimulate  their  economies.  Consequently  uncoordinated 
decision-making can lead to inefficiently low demand. Moreover, the space for policy action 
in  the  deficit  countries  is  in  most  cases  circumscribed,  placing  more  of  the  onus  on  the 
surplus countries that have more room for manoeuvre. 
Now, in principle, coordination could generate a better outcome by helping policymakers to 
internalise the consequences of their actions. And that is indeed what the G20 Framework 
for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth set out to achieve. But implementing such a 
coordinated  outcome  turns  out  not  to  be  so  easy.  In  part  that  follows  from  the  inherent 
asymmetry noted above, namely that the pressure to adjust is always greater on the debtor 
than the creditor. In addition, because multiple actions by multiple actors are needed, there is 
a genuine difficulty in ensuring that agreements are stuck to and free riding is avoided. And 
that  is  more  of  a  problem,  the  weaker  are  the  political  ties  between  countries.  For  these 
reasons,  examples  of  successful  macroeconomic  policy  co-ordination  are  few  and  far 
between and have most often occurred when everyone is pulling in the same direction, such 
as at the time of the London G20 Summit in 2009 when policy makers around the globe were 
staring into the abyss. After all, as Samuel Pepys remarked: Nothing concentrates the mind 
like an imminent hanging. 
But I do not wish to conclude by offering too downbeat an assessment of attempts to achieve 
a  better  economic  outcome  through  international  policy  coordination.  At  a  minimum,  the 
exchange of views and a better understanding of country positions may help to avoid even 
worse outcomes. For example, in 2009, there was real concern that countries might respond 
by resorting to protectionist measures. That has, by and large, been avoided. 
And some aspects of the international policy process have worked well. A good example is, 
in my view, provided by the redrawing of the scope of financial regulation. Here the G20 has 
set  the  overall  political  direction  and  tone,  delegating  the  task  of  developing  a  detailed 
template  for  new  international  rules  and  regulations  to  the  technocrats  on  the  Financial 
Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. This division of labour has 
enabled a substantial amount of new regulation relating to matters such as bank capital and 
liquidity requirements, financial sector compensation, and the principles for handling failing 
financial institutions to be developed in a relatively short period of time. 
So,  despite  the  modest  progress  in  restoring  our  economies  to  Strong,  Sustainable  and 
Balanced Growth in the global economy, policy makers can claim some successes. And on 
that more upbeat note, let me conclude. Thank you!
