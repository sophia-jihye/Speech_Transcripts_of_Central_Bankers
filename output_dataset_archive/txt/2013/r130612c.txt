Per Jansson: Perspectives on the Riksbank’s monetary policy 
Speech  by  Mr  Per  Jansson,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  the  Centre  for 
Business and Policy Studies, Stockholm, 7 June 2013. 
 Nowadays one can hardly open a newspaper without seeing headlines about the Riksbank. 
Many have opinions about the monetary policy we have conducted in recent years, and the 
one we are conducting now.  
The opinions differ in nature. The Riksbank has conducted the monetary policy we consider 
best  balanced  to  attain  the  inflation  target  and  create  conditions  for  long-run  sustainable 
growth. However, some analysts have not shared the Riksbank's view of economic prospects 
and have therefore reached slightly different conclusions as to how monetary policy should 
have  been  designed.  Of  course,  this  type  of  difference  of  opinion  is  not  particularly 
remarkable in a field such as monetary policy, where decisions necessarily have to be based 
on assessments. 
But there are also other objections that are more a matter of principle and aimed at the very 
way the Riksbank conducts its policy. Although it is not always stated explicitly, the message 
is that the Riksbank is conducting a policy other than the one it is intended to conduct – that, 
to put it drastically, the Riksbank has misunderstood its task and is "playing by its own rules".  
It has been claimed, for instance, that the Riksbank has a tendency to be over-zealous in 
combating inflation and to care too little about unemployment. Seen over a longer period of 
time, inflation would thus on average have been too low and unemployment unnecessarily 
high – this has also led to a discussion about the target for monetary policy.  
Others argue that the Riksbank takes into consideration in its repo-rate decision factors that 
should not be considered. This criticism has been mainly aimed at the Riksbank’s concerns 
over  household  debt  that  have  contributed  to  monetary  policy  being  somewhat  less 
expansionary in recent years than would otherwise have been the case. It has sometimes 
even  been  claimed  that  the  Riksbank  has  on  its  own  initiative  introduced  new  targets  for 
monetary policy that lie outside its statutory mandate.  
Here  I  would  like  to  be  clear  about  my  personal  opinion:  I  think  that  the  Riksbank  has 
succeeded well in its task of attaining low and stable inflation. I thus do not share the view 
that we have been over-zealous in combating inflation. I also think that a policy that gives 
consideration to the risks in the credit and housing markets is entirely compatible with our 
mandate of creating conditions for stable economic growth and that this has nothing to do 
with introducing new targets for monetary policy. As it would be unfortunate if the impression 
that the Riksbank is exceeding its mandate takes root, I intend to use much of the time at my 
disposal today to explain why I consider this not to be correct. Furthermore, the Riksbank's 
aim to take risks into consideration to attain a long-run stable development of the economy is 
well  in  line  with  the  international  discussions  now  taking  place  regarding  the  choice  of 
direction faced by central banks in the wake of the financial crisis. I would therefore also like 
to broaden the perspective and put the debate here in Sweden in a larger context.  
We need a nuanced discussion of the development of inflation 
Let  me  begin  with  the  criticism  that  the  Riksbank  has  been  over-zealous  in  combating 
inflation. The actual starting point for this criticism is that CPI (consumer price index) inflation 
has undershot the inflation target of 2 per cent on average since the target was introduced. 
This  has  received  considerable  media  attention  and  been  debated  in  blogs  –  which  is  of 
course  not  a  problem  in  itself.  It  is  important  and  absolutely  necessary  that  the  target 
attainment  of  monetary  policy  is  analysed  and  discussed  to  enable  the  Riksdag  and 
ultimately the Swedish people, to ensure themselves that the Riksbank is doing the job it has

been  assigned  to  do.  But  for  exactly  this  reason  it  is  unfortunate  that  the  reporting  of  the 
average inflation rate has often been rather superficial and in certain cases, intentionally or 
unintentionally, not entirely correct. In some extreme cases it has even been claimed that the 
inflation target has in practice ceased to apply. Headlines and comments of this type hardly 
contribute to a serious debate on monetary policy.  
Let us begin by looking at the data and seeing how inflation has developed since the target 
was  introduced.  As  you  probably  know,  the  target  was  announced  in  January  1993,  but 
began to apply officially to the annual increase in the CPI with effect from 1995.1 To obtain an 
inflation series that better corresponds to the one the Riksbank had access to when making 
its repo-rate decisions, one has to take into account the fact that the calculation method for 
the  CPI  was  changed  in  2005.  Inflation  has  varied  substantially  during  the  period,  both 
overshooting and undershooting the target, but it has been 1.4 per cent on average during 
the period January 1995 to December 2012, that is six tenths of a percentage point lower 
than the inflation target of 2 per cent.  
Some critics seem to assume that this is all the information one needs to assess monetary 
policy. They argue that each tenth of a per cent below the target has entailed major costs to 
the real economy, and this is enough to draw the conclusion that monetary policy has not 
been able to deliver what it should.  
Do not forget how things were in the 1970s and 1980s! 
My  view  is  that  one  must  look  at  the  development  of  inflation  in  the  right  perspective  and 
remember how things were before the target was introduced. Let us compare inflation and 
economic developments in general during the twenty years the inflation target has been in 
place with the twenty years prior to its introduction. During the 1970s and 1980s, average 
inflation  was  almost  in  double  figures  and  varied  substantially  from  year  to  year  (see 
Figure 1). Sweden was a country without a nominal anchor. There was no credible level for 
inflation  that  price  setting  and  wage  formation  could  use  as  benchmark  and  the  economy 
was  stuck  in  a  devaluation  cycle.  This  was  a  fundamental  problem  that  the  Swedish 
economy was suffering when it entered the 1990s crisis.  
We came out of the crisis with a whole new monetary policy regime – inflation targeting. This 
policy was relatively untested internationally and it was far from clear that it would work. Such 
doubts may seem surprising today, bearing in mind how natural an inflation target is now and 
how inflation expectations are stably anchored around the target. And this, in turn, reflects 
the most important contribution from inflation targeting – in my opinion its main merit – that it 
has functioned as a nominal anchor for the economy for two decades (see Figure 2).  
The  reform  of  the  monetary  policy  framework  was  not  the  only  important  change  in  the 
Swedish economy following the crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. However, the inflation 
target  is  definitely  one  of  the  most  important  explanations  for  inflation  being  on  average 
around 7 percentage points lower during the two decades following the crisis, compared with 
the two decades prior to the crisis. In addition, inflation has been much more stable. At the 
same time, growth has not been lower than before; rather it has been quite a bit higher (see 
Figure 3). From this perspective, I think that one must say that inflation targeting has been a 
great success.  
CPIF inflation of 1.8 per cent on average is a good result 
An assessment of monetary policy cannot merely be based on an analysis using hindsight 
and  comparing  inflation  outcomes  with  the  target.  There  are  a  number  of  reasons  why 
                                                 
1   From 1993 to 1995, monetary policy was aimed at preventing the temporary inflationary impulse that arose in 
connection  with  the  krona  being  allowed  to  float  becoming  entrenched  and  leading  to  an  increase  in  the 
underlying rate of inflation.

inflation may deviate from the target, despite monetary policy being conducted accurately. It 
is  therefore  necessary  to  modulate  the  analysis  and  see  which  factors  explain  why  CPI 
inflation has on average undershot the target.  
The  prices  in  the  Swedish  CPI  include  a  component  that  reflects  households'  mortgage 
interest  expenditure.  When  mortgage  rates  rise,  this  component  contributes  to  pushing  up 
CPI inflation and, vice versa, when mortgage rates fall, it pushes down inflation. Normally, 
the variable mortgage rates follow the development of the repo rate fairly closely. This means 
that when the Riksbank cuts the repo rate to increase activity in the economy and gradually 
bring up inflation, the initial result is that CPI inflation falls, that is to say, the direct impact on 
inflation is "in the wrong direction". This is why the Riksbank often allows monetary policy to 
be  guided  by  the  CPIF  inflation  measure  –  a  measure  of  underlying  inflation  that  is  not 
directly affected by changes in mortgage rates and therefore is not impacted by this effect 
(see Figure 4). 
The  fact  that  the  CPI  is  impacted  by  changes  in  the  interest  rate  in  this  way  is  of  course 
something the Riksbank was aware of when the inflation target was introduced. The choice 
was still made to define the target in terms of the CPI, as the CPI is a broad price index that 
represents normal purchases and is familiar to the general public. But as the Riksbank has 
pointed out, measures of underlying inflation are also used to obtain indications of the more 
lasting inflationary pressures. CPI inflation is constantly affected by temporary factors, which 
there  is  no  reason  to  counteract  with  monetary  policy  –  for  instance,  the  direct  effect  on 
interest expenditure of the Riksbank's own monetary policy. Underlying measures, such as 
the CPIF, have thus often been used to guide monetary policy.2  
Twenty years is a long time, and one might expect that the effects of fluctuations in interest 
rates  on  the  interest-expenditure  component  in  the  CPI  would  offset  one  another.  The 
average inflation rate according to both the CPI and the CPIF would therefore be roughly the 
same. However, this is not the case. The average rate of inflation measured in terms of the 
CPIF during the period 1995-2012 is 1.8 per cent. In other words, most of the deviation in 
CPI inflation from the inflation target is explained by interest rates falling more than they have 
risen  during  the  period.  When  this  effect  is  discounted,  there  remains  a  deviation  of  two 
tenths of a percentage point from the inflation target. Although this deviation should not be 
ignored,  it  can  hardly  be  called  a  major  failure.  From  a  broader  historical  perspective  and 
with a realistic attitude to the precision of monetary policy, I think that one can stick out one's 
neck and say that an average CPIF inflation rate of 1.8 per cent is a pass rate, perhaps even 
a pass with distinction. 
Calculations of costs in terms of number of unemployed must be taken with a rather 
large pinch of salt  
This leads me in to the discussion on the costs to the real economy of inflation on average 
undershooting the target. One calculation has been presented by my former Executive Board 
colleague,  Lars  E.O.  Svensson,  who  arrived  at  an  average  cost  corresponding  to  38,000 
persons  unnecessarily  unemployed.3  Another  figure  regarding  the  costs  of  the  monetary 
policy conducted that has attracted some attention is that 60,000 fewer people would have 
                                                 
2   Support for this use of underlying inflation measures, combined with an inflation target defined in terms of the 
CPI, was expressed in the assessment of the Riksbank's monetary policy 2005-2010 carried out by professors 
Goodhart and Rochet in 2011. 
3   Svensson (2013a,b). Mr Svensson examines the period 1997-2011 and calculates that if inflation during this 
period  had  on  average  been  2  per  cent  instead  of  1.4  per  cent,  unemployment  would  have  been  0.8 
percentage  points  lower.  If  the  labour  force  is  held  constant,  this  corresponds  to  around  38,000  fewer 
unemployed.

been unemployed if the repo rate had been kept at the rate of 0.25 per cent, to which it was 
cut during the financial crisis, until today.4 I will return to this particular calculation later on.  
As I mentioned in my introduction, it is important to assess monetary policy and to analyse 
potential consequences of deviations from the inflation target. But one must also be aware of 
the impact of such analyses and that there is a clear risk that apparently exact figures will be 
regarded as concrete truths in the debate. All calculations of this nature are based on strong 
assumptions and are very uncertain, something that is easily forgotten or just ignored. 
Take the calculations that I mentioned earlier. Without going into detail, one can note that 
they  only  focus  on  what  CPI  inflation  has  been  on  average  –  the  costs  in  terms  of 
unnecessary unemployment have arisen solely because the average CPI inflation rate has 
been  below  2  per  cent.  Supposedly,  the  idea  is  that  this  could  have  been  avoided  if  the 
Riksbank had cut the repo rate more and brought inflation up to 2 per cent.  
But is this all there is to it? Remember, the important thing here is that CPI inflation is 2 per 
cent. So the Riksbank should actually have raised rather than cut the repo rate. The direct 
effect would then have been that CPI inflation would have been higher through the effects on 
the  interest-expenditure  component  of  the  CPI.  Of  course,  this  would  also  have  had  a 
dampening  effect  on  activity  in  the  economy  and  on  the  inflation  rate  that  is  not  affected 
directly  by  changes  in  mortgage  rates,  namely  CPIF  inflation.  But  this  could  have  been 
compensated with more and larger interest rate increases and CPI inflation could thus have 
been kept at 2 per cent. CPIF inflation would then fall increasingly, but this would not matter 
as  the  calculation  assumes  that  it  is  solely  the  average  CPI  inflation  rate  that  creates  the 
unnecessary unemployment.  
Before anyone thinks that I have gone over to the dark side, let me say that this would of 
course have been an absurd and destructive monetary policy. But it illustrates the difficulty of 
interpreting the results of calculations that solely focus on the average of CPI inflation.  
Söderström and Vredin (2013) discuss this, among other things, in an analysis of inflation, 
unemployment and monetary policy. One conclusion of their analysis is that the link between 
CPI inflation and unemployment has many causes and that it in itself therefore does not give 
much  guidance  as  to  how  well  monetary  policy  has  been  conducted.  They  also  make  an 
alternative  calculation  of  the  effects  of  monetary  policy  on  unemployment,  based  on  the 
deviation in CPIF inflation from 2 per cent and reach a figure of around 12,000 unemployed 
on  average.  But  the  main  message  in  their  analysis  is  that  calculations  of  this  type  must 
necessarily be based on a number of more or less realistic assumptions of how the economy 
functions.  It  is  therefore  important  to  take  the  figures  produced  with  a  fairly  large  pinch  of 
salt.5  
Recent criticism  
As I noted in my introduction, in addition to the criticism of the historical attainment of the 
inflation  target,  there  has  also  been  criticism  of  the  policy  conducted  in  recent  years.  This 
claims  that  the  Riksbank  has  considered  factors  in  its  repo-rate  decisions  that  should  not 
have  been  considered.  The  main  focus  of  this  criticism  has  been  that  the  Riksbank  has 
concerned itself with household debt and developments on the housing market and thus not 
conducted a sufficiently expansionary monetary policy. Sometimes it has even been claimed 
that  the  Riksbank  has  introduced  a  new  target  that  contravenes  its  mandate  and  that  the 
Riksbank has begun to conduct "housing policy". 
                                                 
4   Svensson (2013c). 
5   Assar Lindbeck, although having preferred a lower interest rate than the one the Riksbank decided on, also 
argues that this type of calculation should not be taken “too seriously”, as it is based on assumptions that are 
“too uncertain” (Dagens Industri, 2013a).

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
This  is  of  course  an  attempt  to  take  the  argument  to  its  extreme.  Monetary  policy  has 
constantly been aimed at bringing inflation back on target and creating conditions for long-
run stable growth in the Swedish economy. The reason why the Riksbank has conducted the 
policy  it  has  conducted  is  that  it  has  tried  to  reduce  the  risk  of  excessive  debt  and  overly 
inflated housing prices. Swedish household debt has shown a sharp upward trend over the 
past  15  years  or  so  and  is  now  very  high,  both  from  an  historical  and  an  international 
perspective  (see  Figure  5).  If  housing  prices  were  for  some  reason  to  fall  heavily  in  a 
situation with high debt levels, households would find that their earlier calculations no longer 
held and that their balance sheets did not look the way they expected. This could in turn start 
a process whereby households try to get rid of some of their debt. This would mean that their 
income would for some time to come be used for amortisation rather than consumption and 
investment – we would experience a fall in demand in the economy.6 One important reason 
for  the  recovery  from  the  crisis  being  so  slow  in  a  number  of  countries  is  probably  that 
households have a large ”debt overhang” they are trying to get rid of.7  
If  one  were  to  have  this  type  of  development,  it  would  most  probably  mean  that 
unemployment rose sharply and it would probably also be difficult to attain the inflation target 
for quite a long time to come. In the countries where housing prices have fallen in connection 
with  the  crisis,  unemployment  has  increased  quite  substantially  (see  Figure  6).  Excessive 
debt 
to  macroeconomic  stability  and  price  stability,  and 
counteracting risks in this area is therefore entirely in line with the Riksbank's mandate and 
objectives.8 
thus  constitutes  a 
threat 
The idea behind the Riksbank's policy 
The idea behind the Riksbank's policy can be illustrated with the aid of two stylised scenarios 
(see Figure 7). Either one conducts a more expansionary monetary policy, as represented by 
the blue line, which endeavours to bring inflation up to the target within a relatively short time 
and to quickly reduce unemployment. However, this policy means that lending to households 
will increase and prices in the housing market will rise, ultimately to untenable levels. When 
housing prices fall at a later stage, inflation will therefore undershoot the target substantially 
and unemployment will be far above its long-run equilibrium level. All in all, target attainment 
will therefore not be very good. 
The  second  alternative,  as  represented  by  the  red  line,  entails  a  less  expansionary  policy 
that lets it take a little longer to return to the inflation target and reduces unemployment more 
slowly  –  and  in  the  short-term  perspective  therefore  leads  to  poorer  target  attainment. 
However,  this  policy  also  means  that  one  avoids  debt  becoming  excessively  high  and 
housing prices accelerating out of control. One thus also avoids the turbulence that arises 
from  a  subsequent  fall  in  housing  prices  and  target  attainment  is  better  in  a  longer-term 
perspective. This policy is usually described as monetary policy "leaning against the wind". 
It should be emphasised that this is of course an exaggerated and highly stylised example 
aimed at proving a point of principle. In reality, the deliberations we have to make are much 
more complex.9 Monetary policy is not a question of choosing between two alternatives that 
                                                 
6   Large debt levels can entail problems even if housing prices do not fall, as households become more sensitive 
to interest rate changes. See, for instance, the analysis on the discretionary income calculations in Financial 
Stability Report 2013:1, Sveriges Riksbank. 
7   See, for example, Mian and Sufi (2011). Jordà, Schularick and Taylor (2011) show in a study of crises in 14 
countries during the period 1870-2008 that if the upswing phase is marked by a strong credit boom, the crisis 
tends to be deeper and the recovery slower.  
8  Note  that  such  a  scenario  would  not  necessarily  lead  to  financial  stability  problems.  See,  for  example,  the 
stress tests published in the Riksbank's Financial Stability Reports. 
9   Of course, the repo rate is not the only tool for managing this type of circumstance, which is discussed below.

will  occur  with  certainty  if  one  conducts  a  specific  policy;  it  entails  weighing  the  risks  and 
probabilities of various scenarios against one another. In this case, the risk of a really poor 
development further ahead must be balanced against short-term costs. One is forced, so to 
speak, to pay an "insurance premium" in that a slightly less expansionary monetary policy in 
the short term leads to slightly lower inflation and slightly higher unemployment. A particularly 
difficult situation arises if a weak development of the real economy means that the short-term 
costs of conducting a less expansionary policy appear to be large at the same time as the 
risks linked to credit granting and the housing market increase.  
To summarise: in principle, there is no doubt that the Riksbank according to its mandate may 
take  into  consideration  risks  linked  to  a  rapid  increase  in  household  debt.  Such  risks  can 
constitute a threat to both the stability of the macro economy and inflation. To me, saying that 
the Riksbank has no mandate to take these risks into account therefore appears rather odd. 
As the Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, has put it: “Monetary policy cannot 
just  ‘mop  up’  after  a  crisis.  Risks  must  be  dealt  with  beforehand.  I  do  not  see  this  as 
inconsistent with inflation targeting because it is the stability of inflation over long periods, not 
year to year changes, which is crucial to economic success.”10 Similar thoughts are expressed 
in  the  IMF's  Article  IV  consultation  for  Sweden:  ”[I]f  mortgage  credit  growth  increases 
unsustainably,  the  Riksbank  might  have  to  raise  the  interest  rate  path  relative  to  that 
warranted by short-run macroeconomic considerations alone.”11 
Is it meaningful to consider risks linked to household debt in monetary policy? 
If  one  is  thinking  about  giving  consideration  to  risks  linked  to  household  debt  when 
formulating monetary policy, it is reasonable to first take a stance on a number of specific 
questions.12  Does  the  repo  rate  have  an  effect  on  the  variables  one  wishes  to  influence, 
housing prices and lending? How large are the risks linked to household debt? And finally, 
are there other tools at hand that are better-suited to managing these risks?  
The answers to these questions are important for determining whether it is justified taking the 
risks  linked  to  household  debt  into  account  in  monetary  policy.  It  is  also  precisely  these 
questions that have been discussed in the general debate on the role of monetary policy in 
this context. I therefore intend to discuss these questions one by one and in relative detail. 
Can the repo rate affect housing prices and lending? 
It is probably true that the effect of a typical change in the policy rate on housing prices and 
lending  to  households  is  on  average  not  very  large.  In  addition,  the  policy  rate  is  a  blunt 
instrument when it comes to influencing housing prices and lending, as it is an interest rate 
that  applies  to  the  whole  economy.  This  is  why  more  specific  tools,  what  are  known  as 
macroprudential tools, are generally perceived as more appropriate than the policy rate for 
counteracting this type of specific imbalances.  
But  the  effect  of  the  policy  rate  most  likely  varies  quite  substantially  depending  on  the 
circumstances  prevailing  at  a  specific  time.  In  some  situations  it  may  be  enough  to  make 
fairly limited increases to subdue an overly rapid upswing in the housing market, for instance, 
if the central bank combines these increases with communication emphasising that current 
developments  are  perceived  as  cause  for  concern.13  Small  interest  rate  increases  then 
function  more  as  a  concrete  "reminder"  that  the  central  bank  is  concerned  over

have been justified.

developments, but it is rather the communication in itself that has the dampening effect. In 
this case, the impact on the rest of the economy need not be so great either. The fact that 
communication on monetary policy can play an important role in this context is emphasised 
by, for instance, Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada and soon to be Governor of 
the  Bank  of  England:  “[P]rivate  agents  may  choose  to  accumulate  less  debt  if  they 
understand that a broad-based build-up of debt is likely to cause the central bank to raise 
interest rates.”14 
Monetary policy is expansionary 
It should be fairly clear that it is precisely this type of "signalling strategy" that the Riksbank 
has used. Monetary policy since the crisis has not entailed using sky-high interest rates to 
stop an upswing in lending and housing prices, at any cost. What we have tried to do is to 
find a suitable balance to be able to support the recovery, without “pressing too hard on the 
accelerator”, thereby contributing at least at the margin to  a calmer development in house 
prices and lending to households. It can hardly be claimed that the policy conducted by the 
Riksbank  during  the  recovery  from  the  crisis  has  been  tight  or  that  the  current  policy  rate 
level does not contribute to boosting economic activity.  
I also think that in this context it is useful to look at the international debate. Although the 
general  view  is  that  macroprudential  instruments  are  normally  preferable  for  counteracting 
this type of imbalance, there is also a lively debate on what role the policy rate should play.15 
In this debate, it is not assumed that the policy rate is entirely ineffective and insignificant, 
and "the jury is still out".  
A dubious counterfactual experiment 
I would like to give an example from the Swedish debate, where I believe one has taken the 
potential of monetary policy to influence expectations too lightly. As I mentioned earlier, it has 
been  claimed  that  up  to  60,000  more  people  would  have  had  jobs  if  the  Riksbank  had 
conducted a different monetary policy after the crisis and kept the repo rate at the level of 
0.25 per cent to which it was cut in July 2009.16  
When the Riksbank began to raise the repo rate in the middle of 2010, the situation was such 
that  the  Swedish  economy  had  recovered  surprisingly  quickly  from  the  crisis.  Growth  was 
record high, about 6 per cent in annualised terms in the first quarter, and basically all leading 
indicators  of  economic  activity  were  pointing  upwards.  Household  lending,  which  had 
increased at double figures in terms of annual changes prior to the crisis, had begun to slow 
down,  but  the  increase  in  credit  was  still  9  per  cent,  far  above  the  increase  in  disposable 
income. At the same time, inflation measured in terms of the CPIF was close to 2 per cent. 
I find it difficult to see that it would have been realistic to declare in this situation that the repo 
rate would not be raised, but would remain at 0.25 per cent for the foreseeable future. The 
expectations  this  would  have  created  among  households  and  on  the  credit  and  housing 
markets  would  most  likely  have  been  very  difficult  to  manage.  Such  a  policy  might  be 
appropriate to try to "kick-start" an economy that has suffered a severe crisis, where housing 
prices have already fallen and households are trying to reduce their debt. But for countries 
that  are  not  in  this  situation,  and  where  debt  and  housing  prices  remain  high  and  are 
increasing, it does not appear to be a realistic policy.

How large are the risks linked to household debt?  
Let me now move on to the next question, which concerns the actual size of the risks linked 
to household debt in Sweden.  
It is true that there are estimates suggesting that the housing market in Sweden is not over-
valued. Some of these estimates have been made by the Riksbank itself. This could mean 
that the high level of debt among Swedish households is not such a large problem, either. 
But there are also estimates that suggest an overvaluation.17 And when there is so much at 
stake, there are good reasons, as I see it, to be particularly cautious.  
After all, it was not the case that the corresponding estimates prior to the crisis showed any 
impending  problems  in  the  countries  that  have  now  been  hit  so  hard.  As  Stefan  Gerlach, 
Deputy  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Ireland,  noted  recently,  it  is  always  easy  to  gain 
support for the opinion that housing prices are currently correctly valued – even if this soon 
proves  to  be  incorrect.18  In  Ireland,  the  opinion  immediately  prior  to  the  crisis  was  that 
housing  prices  were  not  abnormally  high  and  that  the  banks  were  stable  and  well-
consolidated.  I  am  convinced  that  this  was  how  most  countries,  which  have  suffered 
problems, viewed their situation.19 
Nor does the size of household wealth appear to have had any decisive significance for the 
impact of the crisis. The countries that have been hit hardest include ones with both stronger 
and weaker wealth positions than Sweden (see Figure 8). The reason why a strong wealth 
position does not necessarily provide a good protection is probably that a large part of the 
wealth mass is not very liquid and thus its use as a buffer in times of crisis is limited. This 
applies in particular if the crisis leads to a fall in housing prices. A high level of wealth is thus 
no guarantee for avoiding problems; the best strategy is of course to try to prevent a crisis 
from arising at all.  
It may of course be the case that we in Sweden really are different. But I am sceptical to this. 
I think it is very risky to rely on this being the case. Now that we have seen that the costs in 
many countries have been so high, I at least draw the conclusion that there is reason to try to 
reduce  the  risk  that  we  may  also  find  ourselves  in  this  situation,  even  if  it  is  not  the  most 
likely  development.  As  I  mentioned  earlier,  monetary  policy  is  to  a  large  extent  about 
managing risk. I have not so far felt that the short-term gains of a slightly more expansionary 
policy  are  sufficient  to  compensate  for  the  threat  of  losses  further  ahead  in  a  really  bad 
scenario.20 But, once again, it is a question of balance and things may change over time. The 
policy  we  have  conducted  has  actually  been  expansionary  and  mainly  concerned  sending 
signals that developments give cause for concern. At some point the "insurance premium" 
becomes too large, but I do not think this can be said to have happened yet. 
                                                 
17   For a comprehensive survey of the valuation of the Swedish housing market, see Sørensen (2013), in which 
the  following  conclusion  is  drawn  (p.  71-72):  “[A]  cautious  reading  of  the  evidence  gives  reason  to  expect 
downward pressure on Swedish real house prices in the years to come. And if the Swedish economy were to 
be hit by a large negative shock, the downward adjustment of house prices could become more rapid than the 
analysis … would suggest.” 
18   See Dagens Industri (2013b). 
19   Bernanke (2010) describes the difficulties experienced by the Federal Reserve in determining whether or not 
the housing market in the United States was over-valued.  
20   Similar ideas can be found in, for instance, Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia and Mauro (2013), p. 7: “[G]iven what we 
have  learned  about  the  costs  of  inaction,  higher  type  I  errors  (assuming  that  it  is  a  bubble  and  acting 
accordingly, when in fact the increase reflects fundamentals) in exchange for lower type II errors (assuming 
the increase reflects fundamentals, when in fact it is a bubble) may well be justified.”

Are better instruments than the policy rate already available? 
The third question concerns the access to other tools than the repo rate for managing risk. 
Those who are critical of using the repo rate claim that there are already other and better-
suited instruments available.  
I consider this criticism to be a little strange and to make too many assumptions in advance. 
It seems to assume that there is already a framework for macroprudential policy in place in 
Sweden, which clearly states what instruments are to be used and by whom. Let us assume, 
for instance, that the Riksbank had held the policy rate at 0.25 per cent up until now, as was 
the case in the counterfactual experiment I mentioned earlier, and that this had meant that 
lending to households and housing prices had begun to rise sharply again. Would it really 
have been obvious how this should have been managed and by whom? Bearing in mind how 
the  risks  in  this  field  have  been  allowed  to  increase  in  Sweden  over  the  past  15  years,  I 
doubt that this would have been the case. 
In  other  words,  I  believe  we  are  still  a  long  way  from  a  satisfactory  situation.  I  am  quite 
convinced that for this to work the allocation of responsibility must first be clearly specified 
and there must be clear guidelines for what should be done. However, a potential framework 
for  macroprudential  policy  is  only  under  investigation.  The  Financial  Crisis  Committee  has 
presented a partial report that was recently circulated for consultation. But it is not likely that 
a complete solution will be in place in the very near future.  
Different views on macroprudential tasks 
Judging  by  the  consultation  responses  to  the  Financial  Crisis  Committee's  partial  report, 
opinions are relatively divided as to what role macroprudential policy should play with regard 
to the development the Riksbank has tried to manage in recent years. There is a possibility 
that  excessive  debt  could  result  in  a  conspicuously  weak  macroeconomic  development 
without any threat to the stability of the banking system. Some of those consulted consider 
that macroprudential policy does not have a role to play in reducing these types of risk, given 
that they do not present a clear threat to the stability of the banking system.21 With this type of 
solution monetary policy would not obtain the support from macroprudential policy needed to 
be  relieved  of  "leaning  against  the  wind".  Indeed,  my  impression  is  that  macroprudential 
policy is often assumed to focus on the stability of the banking system. This means that risks 
in the credit and housing markets that do not clearly threaten the banking system, but could 
nevertheless lead to major macroeconomic problems, would risk being overlooked.  
There is a lot that remains to be investigated and decided on before a practical framework for 
macroprudential  policy  is  in  place.  My  impression  is  that,  compared  with  many  other 
countries,  we  have  if  anything  fallen  a  little  behind.  This  is  unfortunate,  as  the  situation  in 
Sweden,  as  I  noted  earlier,  is  actually  slightly  more  sensitive  than  that  in  many  other 
countries, where housing prices have already fallen and households have begun to amortise 
their debts to a more significant extent. 
Well in line with the international discussion  
One thing I think it is important to emphasise – and which is not always clear in the Swedish 
debate – is that the Riksbank's aim to give consideration to the risks arising from household 
debt and the housing market is well in line with the international view that has emerged in the 
wake  of  the  financial  crisis.  The  Riksbank's  way  of  reasoning,  and  the  policy  we  have 
conducted, are thus not unusual or strange, but are characteristic for the present time. 
                                                 
21   The Swedish National Debt Office (2013) writes, for instance, in its consultation response that with the solution 
they advocate, "it would not be possible to justify any macroprudential policy measures if the conclusion was 
that  the  risks  inherent  in  current  household  debt  were  primarily  a  demand-related  problem  (rather  than  a 
problem for the banking system)." (p. 2).

There is even reason to claim that the Riksbank was one of the first central banks to highlight 
this type of risk. Household debt and housing prices were a fairly hot topic on the Riksbank's 
monetary policy agenda a relatively long time before the global financial crisis broke out.22 
Moreover,  Sweden  is  usually  regarded  as  one  of  the  few  countries  that  has  in  practice 
applied a policy that, to some extent at least, "leans against the wind".23 
The  dominant  view  prior  to  the  crisis  was  that  central  banks  should  not  actively  try  to 
counteract  the  build-up  of  financial  imbalances,  but  should  act  forcefully  once  a  crisis  had 
occurred.  Instead  of  "leaning  against  the  wind",  they  should  in  other  words  make  do  with 
"mopping  up  afterwards"  –  they  should  "clean  but  not  lean".  Trying  to  take  preventive 
measures was perceived as too difficult and too costly, while it was assumed that it would not 
be very problematic to quickly clean up after a crisis.  
After the crisis - greater emphasis on preventive measures 
There is no doubt that the view has changed considerably since the financial crisis.24 In many 
countries, the combination of high household debt and a fall on the housing market marked 
the start of a period of weak demand, high unemployment and very weak public finances – 
problems that several countries are still struggling with.  
Cleaning  up  afterwards  proved  to  be  much  more  difficult  than  anyone  had  thought.  One 
lesson  from  the  crisis  is  thus  that  one  must  take  much  more  preventive  action  and  try  to 
counteract a development with rapidly-increasing debt and housing prices. How this can best 
be achieved is a subject for much discussion around the world at present.  
It  is  important  to  realise  that  the  starting  point  for  this  discussion  is  somewhat  different  in 
different countries. In countries that have already been hit hard by the crisis the unthinkable 
has  already  happened,  so  to  speak.  There  it  is  necessary to  consider how  to  prevent  this 
from  happening  again,  but  as  housing  prices  have  already  fallen  and  households  have 
already begun to reduce their debt, the situation does not appear acute. In other words, they 
have a little time to find a way of preventing the next crisis. 
The situation in Sweden is different. Here we have not had any tangible fall in housing prices, 
at  the  same  time  as  household  debt  is  at  a  high  level,  both  from  an  international  and  an 
historical  perspective.  What  we  must  consider  is  how  we  should  try  to  reduce  the  risk  of 
finding ourselves in the same situation as many others. In this sense, the situation here is 
slightly  more  urgent  and  sensitive.  Norway  and  Canada,  for  instance,  are  in  a  similar 
situation. 
Macroprudential policy – but the policy rate also has a role 
The main line in the international discussion is that financial imbalances should primarily be 
prevented  through  measures  within  the  new  policy  area  known  as  macroprudential  policy. 
But  as  I  said  before,  this  does  not  mean  that  the  policy  rate  has  been  removed  from  the 
agenda. 
One  obvious  reason  for  this  is  that  macroprudential  policy  is  not  yet  in  place  in  many 
countries  and  where  there  is  a  macroprudential  policy,  it  has  often  not  yet  been  put  into 
practice – it is quite simply too new and untested.25 The policy rate is thus as yet one of few 
instruments available for practical use. 
                                                 
22   See, for example, Nyberg (2005), Ingves (2007) and Heikensten (2008). 
23   See, for example, Mishkin (2007) and Cagliarini, Kent and Stevens (2010). 
24   See, for example, the Committee on International Economic Policy and Reform (2011) and Mishkin (2011). 
25   Woodford  (2012),  who  develops  a  theoretical  model  for  how  financial  stability  considerations  can  be 
incorporated into inflation targeting, notes for instance: ”[I]t cannot be claimed that such tools already exist and 
10

But there is also an international discussion on whether the policy rate will have a role to play 
even  when  macroprudential  policy  is  in  place.26  One  reason  is  that  it  may  very  well  prove 
difficult  to  design  a  system  for  macroprudential  policy  that  functions  sufficiently  well  and 
which  inventive  market  participants  are  unable  to  circumvent.  The  policy  rate  is  a  blunt 
instrument, as it has a broad impact on the economy. But at the same time, this may be a 
strength compared with macroprudential tools, simply because it is difficult to "circumvent" a 
policy  rate  increase.  Jeremy  Stein  at  the  Federal  Reserve's  Board  of  Governors  has 
expressed it as the advantage of monetary policy being that it "gets in all of the cracks”.27 It is 
also worth pointing out that in countries such as Norway and Canada they are fairly explicit in 
saying that the policy rate has a role to play in this context – and this is despite the fact that 
they have come further in the macroprudential field than we have.28 
It remains to be seen where we eventually will end up when it comes to this issue. My own 
opinion  is  that  we  will  probably  not  be  able  to  have  a  completely  strict  division  of  labour 
between monetary policy and macroprudential policy and that the policy rate cannot be ruled 
out as a tool for counteracting financial imbalances. There will probably always be situations 
where macroprudential policy needs the support of a monetary policy that at least to some 
extent “leans against the wind”. But we still do not have any certain answers and I believe it 
is wise to keep all doors open.  
A formative stage 
Let  me  round  off.  There  is  no  doubt  that  we  are  internationally  in  what  one  might  call  a 
formative  stage  with  regard  to  macroeconomic  policy  in  general  and  monetary  policy  in 
particular. It is no coincidence that we are meeting here today under the theme "Choices for 
monetary policy" or that the IMF and other organisations arrange conferences on how our 
ideas on macroeconomic policy should change and that sessions on monetary policy have 
titles such as "Many targets, many instruments – where do we stand?"29 
Nor is there any major doubt about the direction to be taken. The financial crisis made it clear 
that much more effort must be put into trying to prevent financial imbalances and manage 
risk in the credit and housing markets. That central banks will play an important role in this 
work is also fairly obvious. It is already clear that monetary policy will not be conducted in 
exactly the same way as prior to the crisis – when the policy rate was in principle set with 
consideration to the short-term business cycle, and when financial stability was more or less 
taken for granted. One clear lesson is that financial imbalances must be taken seriously and 
that central bankers' analyses and model work need to evolve to take this into account. I also 
believe that the analysis of risks will become more central and that "robust” monetary policy 
will be discussed more than before while ”optimal” monetary policy will be discussed less.30 It 
                                                                                                                                                      
have  proven  their  effectiveness,  so  that  there  is  no  ground  at  present  to  dismiss  the  relevance  of  financial 
stability considerations for monetary policy deliberations.” (p. 22).  
26   See, for example, Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia and Mauro (2013), Carney (2013) and Stein (2013). 
27   Stein (2013), p. 17. The Riksbank has also raised this argument in various contexts, see for instance, Nyberg 
(2011). 
28   See, for example, the Bank of Canada (2012). Norges Bank writes in an article on the countercyclical capital 
buffer: ”The countercyclical buffer will strengthen the resilience of the banking sector during an upturn. It may 
also, to some extent, counteract the build-up of financial imbalances, but the effect is uncertain. Thus, Norges 
Bank cannot disregard taking financial imbalances into consideration when setting the key policy rate.” See 
Norges Bank (2013) p.23.

is  also  likely  that  central  banks'  operational  frameworks  for  monetary  policy  will  be  both 
slightly more flexible and slightly more complex than they were before.  
At the same time, it is important not to "throw the baby out with the bathwater". Above all, we 
must  not  jeopardise  the  anchoring  of  long-run  inflation  expectations  –  now  that  we  have 
attained  a  credible  nominal  anchor.  To  a  large  degree,  it  is  thus  a  question  of  making 
adjustments to the existing framework rather than starting all over again. 
But  as  yet  we  do  not  know  exactly  where  this  process  will  take  us,  and  how  central  bank 
operations will look in detail, say, twenty years from now. What we can say with certainty is 
that the discussion on monetary policy and central bank activities will be intensive over the 
coming  years,  both  internally  in  individual  countries  and  internationally.  It  is  important  that 
this discussion is unbiased and modulated and conducted in a good and positive spirit. This 
will help ensure that it results in wise and sustainable solutions.
