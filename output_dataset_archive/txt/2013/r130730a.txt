K C Chakrabarty: Fraud in the banking sector – causes, concerns and 
cures 
Inaugural address by Dr K C Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, 
during the National Conference on Financial Fraud organised by ASSOCHAM, New Delhi, 
26 July 2013. 
 Assistance provided by Ms. Parvathy V. Sundaram and Shri R. K. Sharma is gratefully acknowledged. 
Dr.  Rana  Kapoor,  President,  ASSOCHAM  and  MD  &  CEO,  Yes  Bank;  Shri  M.  J.  Joseph, 
Additional  Secretary  and  Chief  Vigilance  Officer,  Ministry  of  Corporate  Affairs,  Ms.  Preeti 
Malhotra, Chairperson, ASSOCHAM National Council for Corporate Affairs; senior members 
from the financial services industry; delegates to the conference; members of the print and 
electronic media; ladies and gentlemen. It is a pleasure to be here this morning to deliver the 
inaugural address at the National Conference on “Financial Frauds-Risk & Prevention.” 
2. We all know that fraud, and more so, the financial frauds have been in existence for a very 
long time. Some may be surprised, but, it is interesting to note that Kautilya, in his famous 
treatise “Arthashastra” penned down around 300 BC, painted a very graphic detail of what 
we, in modern times, term as “fraud”. Kautilya describes forty ways of embezzlement, some 
of  which  are:  “what  is  realised  earlier  is  entered  later  on;  what  is  realised  later  is  entered 
earlier; what ought to be realised is not realised; what is hard to realise is shown as realised; 
what  is  collected  is  shown  as  not  collected;  what  has  not  been  collected  is  shown  as 
collected; what is collected in part is entered as collected in full; what is collected in full is 
entered  as  collected  in  part;  what  is  collected  is  of  one  sort,  while  what  is  entered  is  of 
another sort.” As you would all agree, some of the above actions continue to be the modus 
operandi adopted in many instances of financial fraud that have hit the headlines in recent 
times. This shows that very little has changed over such a long period in the basics of fraud 
and brings me to the question why has ASSOCHAM now been forced to devote an entire 
day for deliberating the issue. 
3.  Statistics  quoted  in  a  recent  report  by  the  Association  of  Certified  Fraud  Examiners’ 
(ACFE) 2012 titled “Report to the Nation on Occupational Fraud and Abuse” may have some 
answers.The  report  has  estimated  that  a  typical  organization  loses  5%  of  its  revenues  to 
fraud each year and cumulative annual fraud loss globally during 2011 could have been of 
the  order  of  more  than  $3.5  trillion.  The  amount  involved  in  the  frauds  reported  by  the 
banking sector in India  has more than quadrupled from Rs. 2038 crore during 2009–10 to 
Rs. 8646  crore  during  2012–13.  Similarly,  another  report  has  estimated  the  losses  of  the 
Indian insurance companies at a whopping Rs.30, 401 crore in the year 2011 due to various 
frauds which have taken place in the life and general insurance segments. The losses work 
out to about nine per cent of the total estimated size of the insurance industry in 2011. Enron, 
Worldcom  and  more  recently,  the  Libor  manipulation  scandals,  have  caused  major 
upheavals  in  western  nations  and  their  impact  has  been  felt  not  only  in  the  individual 
institutions  or  countries  but  across  the  global  financial  system.  India  too  has  witnessed  a 
spate  of  fraudulent  activities  in  the  corporate  sector  over  the  last  decade  in  the  form  of 
Satyam,  Reebok,  Adidas,  etc.  The  ACFE  report  further  mentions  that  as  in  the  previous 
years,  banking  and  financial  services  industry  continues  to  be  among  the  most  commonly 
victimized sectors as far as fraud is concerned. What the above statistics reveal is that the 
frequency, volume and the gravity of instances of fraud across various sectors, particularly in 
the financial sector, has gone up tremendously over the past few years. With the sweeping 
changes  in  the  scope  and  magnitude  of  banking  transactions  witnessed  in  the  past  few 
decades,  the  emergence  of  hybrid  financial  products,  the  increasing  trend  of  cross  border 
financial transactions and the dynamics of real-time fund movement and transformation, the 
vulnerability  of  the  system  to  the  menace  of  fraud  has  become  higher  than  ever  before.

Against this backdrop, in my address today, I intend to primarily focus on the trend of frauds 
in the banking sector, the causative factors, share my concerns as the banking supervisor 
and highlight the touchstones of a robust fraud risk management and control framework in 
banks. 
Definition of fraud 
4.  Before I  proceed  any  further,  let  us revisit  the  definition  of the  term “Fraud”.  Fraud  can 
loosely  be  defined  as  “any  behavior  by  which  one  person  intends  to  gain  a  dishonest 
advantage  over  another".  In  other  words,  fraud  is  an  act  or  omission  which  is  intended  to 
cause  wrongful  gain  to  one  person  and  wrongful  loss  to  the  other,  either  by  way  of 
concealment of facts or otherwise. Fraud, under Section 17 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, 
includes any of the following acts committed by a party to a contract, or with his connivance, 
or by his agents, with intent to deceive another party thereto or his agent, or to induce him to 
enter into the contract: 
• 
the suggestion as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to 
be true; 
the active concealment of a fact by one having knowledge or belief of the fact; 
a promise made without any intention of performing it; 
any other act fitted to deceive; 
any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent.

5. RBI had, per se, not defined the term “fraud” in its guidelines on Frauds. A definition of 
fraud  was,  however,  suggested  in  the  context  of  electronic  banking  in  the  Report  of  RBI 
Working Group on Information Security, Electronic Banking, Technology Risk Management 
and Cyber Frauds, which reads as under: 
“A  deliberate  act  of  omission  or  commission  by  any  person,  carried  out  in  the 
course of a banking transaction or in the books of accounts maintained manually 
or under computer system in banks, resulting into wrongful gain to any person for 
a temporary period or otherwise, with or without any monetary loss to the bank”. 
Frauds in the banking sector: some statistics 
6. Though RBI had not given a specific definition of the term, it has, for quite some time now, 
been  monitoring  the  nature,  volume  and  magnitude  of  frauds  in  certain  sections  of  the 
financial  sector  that  fall  under  its  jurisdiction.  The  reporting  of  fraud  cases  by  banks  was 
prescribed by RBI way back in July 1970. In 2005–06, the prescription of reporting of fraud 
cases was extended to urban cooperative banks and deposit taking NBFCs registered with 
RBI.  In  March  2012,  NBFC-ND-SIs  (systemically  important,  non-deposit  taking  NBFCs) 
having  asset  base  of  Rs.  100  crore  and  above  were  also  brought  under  the  reporting 
requirements. While online reporting and monitoring of fraud cases by the banks has been in 
place since May 2004, the reporting by UCBs and NBFCs is still in manual format. 
7. A comparative picture (Table 1) of total number of fraud cases and amount involved as on 
March  31,  2013  for  scheduled  commercial  banks,  NBFCs,  Urban  Cooperative  banks,  and 
Financial Institutions is as under:

8.  As  is  evident  from  the  above  table,  the  cumulative  number  of  frauds  reported  by  the 
banking sector and the total amount involved in these fraud cases have a major share in the 
frauds reported by all entities under RBI’s supervisory jurisdiction. A year-wise break up of 
fraud  cases  reported  by  the  banking  sector  together  with  the  amount  involved  is  given  in

9. It may be observed that while the number of fraud cases has shown a decreasing trend 
from  24791  cases  in  2009–10  to  13293  cases  in  2012–13  i.e.  a  decline  of  46.37%,  the 
amount involved has increased substantially from Rs 2037.81 crore to Rs. 8646.00 crore i.e. 
an  increase  of  324.27%.  A  granular  analysis  reveals  that  nearly  80%  of  all  fraud  cases 
involved amounts less than Rs. one lakh while on an aggregated basis, the amount involved 
in such cases  was only  around 2% of the total amount involved. Similarly, the large value 
fraud  cases  involving  amount  of  Rs.50  crore  and  above,  has  also  increased  more  than 
tenfold from 3 cases in FY 2009–10 (involving an amount of Rs 404.13 crore) to 45 cases in 
FY 2013 (involving an amount of Rs 5334.75 crore) (Annex 1). Further, a bank group wise 
analysis  of  frauds  reveals  that  while  the  private  sector  and  the  foreign  bank  groups 
accounted for a majority of frauds by number (82.5%), the public sector banks (including SBI 
Group)  accounted  for  nearly  83%  of  total  amount  involved  in  all  reported  frauds  (Table  3 
below).

A bank group wise distribution of fraud cases in terms of amount involved and details of year 
wise closure of fraud cases is also enclosed at Annex 2 and 3 respectively. 
10. While the sheer number of frauds and the amount involved, when seen in isolation, may 
appear overwhelming, it is important to view the incidence of frauds in the banking sector in 
the context of the massive increase in the number of deposit and credit accounts in banks 
and the staggering volume and value of transactions that are processed by the banks every 
day. To put things in perspective, let me quote some statistics again. The number of deposit 
accounts in the banks over the last ten years (between end 2002 and end 2012) has gone up 
from 43.99 crore to 90.32 crore while the number of loan accounts in the same period has 
also more than doubled from 5.64 crore to 13.08 crore. A quick estimate puts the average 
number  of  all  transactions  that  happen  every  day  in  the  banking  system  at  approximately 
10 crore,  which  is  enormous.  The  number  of  frauds  per  million  banking  transactions  was 
about 0.4, which is not a very high figure. Likewise, besides increase in the number of brick 
and mortar branches, additional service delivery points like ATMs and Point of Sale (POS) 
terminals  have  also  gone  up  significantly. While  the  number  of  ATM  machines  has  grown 
from 34789 in March 2008 to 114014 in March 2013, the number of POS terminals has also 
more than doubled (from 423667 to 845653) during the same period. The point I am trying to 
drive  home  here  is  that  on  a  standalone  basis  the  quantum  of  frauds,  both  in  terms  of 
number and amount involved, may appear to be very high, but when one weighs it against 
the sheer magnitude of accounts and transactions handled by the banking system, they are 
not alarming.

KYC related (mainly in deposit accounts)  
Advances related  
Category of frauds 
11. Broadly, the frauds reported by banks can be divided into three main sub-groups: 
• 
• 
• 
A closer examination of the reported fraud cases has revealed that around 65% of the total 
fraud  cases  reported  by  banks  were  technology  related frauds (covering frauds committed 
through /at internet banking channel, ATMs and other alternate payment channels like credit/ 
debit/prepaid cards) while the advances portfolio accounted for a major proportion (64%) of 
the total amount involved in frauds. Table 4 below shows that relatively large value advances 
related frauds (> Rs. 1 crore) have increased both in terms of number and amount involved 
over the last four years.

Technology related frauds 
12.  The  substantially  larger  proportion  of  technology  related  frauds  by  number  is  only 
expected  as  there  has  been  a  remarkable  shift  in  the  service  delivery  model  with  greater 
technology integration in the financial services sector. Banks are increasingly nudging their 
customers to adopt newer service delivery platforms like mobile, internet and social media, 
for  enhanced  efficiency  and  cost-cutting.  But  while  banks’  customers  have  become  tech-
savvy and started using online banking services and products, evidence suggests that even 
fraudsters  are  devising  newer  ways  of  perpetrating  frauds  by  exploiting  the  loopholes  in 
technology systems and processes. There have been several instances of low value frauds 
wherein  the  fraudsters  have  employed  hostile  software  programs  or  malware  attacks, 
phishing,  Vishing  (voicemail),  SMSishing  (text  messages),  Whaling  (targeted  phishing  on 
High  Networth  Individuals)  techniques  apart  from  stealing  confidential  data  to  perpetrate 
frauds.  Bank  group-wise  detail  of  the  number  of  technology  related  fraud  cases  with  the 
amount involved therein over the last 4 years is as under in Table 5:

13. The predominance of the new private sector banks and the foreign banks in the number 
of technology related frauds is intuitive as they lead the technology enabled service delivery 
in the Indian banking sector. From the above it is evident that though the incidence of cyber 
frauds is extremely high, the actual amount involved is generally very low. However, let me 
emphasize that while the amounts involved may be small from banks’ perspective, these are 
significant from the viewpoint of individuals, who are victims of such frauds. The small value 
of  frauds,  therefore,  cannot  be  a  comfort  to  the  banks.  The  banks  must  realize  that  the 
community that uses online banking services is a very powerful group capable of launching 
scathing  attacks  using  the  social  media,  which  can  irreparably  tarnish  the  reputation  of 
banks. It is, therefore, in banks’ own interest to ensure that they are constantly on the guard 
and up to the challenge of providing a secure environment for customers to conduct banking 
transactions. For this purpose, the banks would need to constantly monitor the typology of 
the  fraudulent  activities  in  such  transactions  and  regularly  review  and  update  the  existing 
security  features  to  prevent  easy  manipulation  by  hackers,  skimmers,  phishers,  etc.  With 
cyber attack becoming more frequent, RBI has advised banks in February 2013 to introduce 
certain minimum checks and balances like introduction of two factor authentication in case of 
“card not present” transactions, converting all strip based cards to chip based cards for better 
security, issuing debit and credit cards only for domestic usage unless sought specifically by 
the  customer,  putting  threshold  limit  on  international  usage  of  debit/  credit  cards,  constant 
review of the pattern of card transactions in coordination with customers, sending SMS alerts 
in respect of card transactions etc., to minimize the impact of such attacks on banks as well 
as customers. 
14. The electronic modes of payment like NEFT and RTGS have gained traction due to their 
almost real time impact and also comparatively lower cost. These transactions are generally 
undertaken remotely, through internet banking, by using specific ID and password provided 
to  the  users.  Though,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  user  to  ensure  that  his  unique  ID  and 
password are properly secured and do not get misused due to his laxity, the banks, on their 
part,  should  also  ensure  that  these  payment  channels  are  safe  and  secure.  Towards  this 
end, RBI has advised banks to introduce preventive measures such as putting a cap on the 
value/ number of beneficiaries, introducing system of issuing alert on inclusion of additional 
beneficiary,  velocity  checks  on  number  of  transactions  effected  per  day/  per  beneficiary, 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
inadequacy  of  KYC  drill  would  render  any  subsequent 
considering  introduction  of  digital  signature  for  large  value  payments,  capturing  internet 
protocol check as an additional validation check for any transaction, etc. 
15. I am sure many of you have heard of recent instances of frauds by way of replication of 
data contained in genuine debit/ credit cards onto duplicate cards. Without getting into much 
detail, it is sufficient to say that the banks need to improve the peripheral and system security 
in ATM locations and, at the same time, educate their customers about using their payment 
cards  with  due  caution.  Similarly,  cases  of  circulation  of  fraudulent  e-mails  and  sms 
messages conveying winning of prize money have become matter of common occurrence in 
recent  times.  Many  a  times,  gullible  people  fall  prey  to  such  e-mails  and  pay  money  in 
designated accounts, which is then quickly siphoned off through ATMs  located in far flung 
areas  of  the  country.  For  this  purpose,  the  fraudsters  generally  use  deposit  accounts  in 
banks with lax KYC drills or accounts which remain inoperative for long. Banks, therefore, not 
only need to caution their customers to guard against such temptations for easy money but 
should also ensure that deposit accounts maintained with them are fully KYC compliant. In 
fact, 
investigation  process 
meaningless.  The  banks  should  also  have  a  system  of  generating  alerts  to  monitor 
transactions  in  accounts  which  are  inoperative  for  long  or  where  transactions  are  not  in 
conformity with general trend and customer risk profile. RBI, as a part of its financial literacy 
programme,  constantly  seeks  to  caution  the  general  public  through  print  media,  electronic 
media and on its web site not to get enamored by the false promises made in such e-mails. 
16. I would like to reiterate here that though the amount involved in technology related frauds 
may  not  appear  to  be  menacing  when  viewed  in  the  backdrop  of  the  total  value  of  daily 
transactions and overall business prolife of the Indian banks, any dent in the confidence of 
the stakeholders in the banking system will result in huge reputational and operational risks 
for the banks, adversely affect public perception and undermine faith in the financial system. 
If the banks are not able to proactively manage the technology risks in their delivery systems, 
they  may  have  to  face  litigations  on  customer  protection  and  also  incur  the  wrath  of  the 
regulators and customer interest groups. Apart from enlisting active co-operation from their 
technology vendors, banks must look to build a close rapport with other banks, investigative 
agencies  and  regulators  to  ensure  that  there  is  prompt  and  coordinated  exchange  of 
information, whenever required. With the spread of mobile banking, banks would also need 
to  closely  engage  with  the  telecom  service  providers  for  reducing  the  technology  related 
fraud risk. Banks could also consider seeking insurance coverage as a risk transfer tool and 
a  mitigant  for  the  financial  losses  arising  from  technology  induced  fraudulent  customer 
transactions. 
Frauds in banks’ advances portfolio 
17. As I mentioned earlier, frauds related to the advances portfolio accounts for the largest 
share of the total amount involved in frauds in the banking sector. Increase in the cases of 
large value fraud (involving amount of Rs. 50 crore and above) in accounts financed under 
consortium or multiple banking arrangements involving even more than 10 banks at times, is 
a newly emerging, but unwelcome trend in the banking sector. Another point that needs to be 
highlighted  here  is  that  public  sector  banks  account  for  a  substantial  chunk  of  the  total 
amount involved in such cases. 
18. Another glaring issue in this context is the considerable delay in declaration of frauds by 
various banks in cases of consortium/ multiple financing. We have on occasions observed 
more than  12–15  months  lag  in  declaration  of  the  same  case  as fraud by  different  banks, 
which not only enables the borrower to defraud the banking system to a larger extent, but 
also  allows  him  considerable  time  to  erase  the  money  trail  and  queer  the  pitch  for  the 
investigative agencies. 
19. Our analysis has highlighted that majority of the credit related frauds are on account of 
deficient  appraisal  system,  poor  post  disbursement  supervision  and  inadequate  follow  up. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 7 
The  absence  of  an  orderly  system  of  information  sharing  among  the  lender  banks  further 
exacerbates  the  problem.  The  laxity  in  post  disbursement  supervision  and  inadequacy  of 
follow up of advances portfolio by banks is clearly underlined by the fact that majority of the 
fraud cases come to light only during the recovery process initiated after the accounts have 
been classified as NPA. Quite often the banks are confronted with the fact that the title deeds 
are not genuine or that the borrowers had availed multiple finance against the same property. 
Although RBI has advised banks to ensure proper exchange of information between lenders 
on the borrowers financed under multiple banking arrangements/ consortium arrangements, 
cases of multiple financing against the same security are still reported to us indicating utter 
disregard in conforming to the basic safeguards. Reserve Bank has also advised banks to 
subject the title deeds in respect of securities charged to them to legal audit periodically so 
that cases of multiple financing may be detected in the initial stages itself. Due diligence on 
other professionals like Chartered Accountants, valuers and advocates involved in the loan 
assessment and sanctioning processes is also an essential safeguard as there have been 
instances where some of these professionals have also facilitated the perpetration of frauds 
by  colluding  with  the  borrowers  to  fabricate  fudged  financial  statements,  inflated  security 
valuation reports, defective search reports for title deeds of mortgaged property, based on 
which banks have been led to overestimate the funding requirements and security cover for 
the same. 
20. In the context of advance related frauds, I wish to raise a fundamental issue for wider 
public  debate.  At  what  stage  should  the  banks  declare  a  loan  account  as  fraud?  Should 
diversion of funds be a basis for defining a borrowal account as fraud? In my opinion, so long 
as the borrower does not dispute that he owes money to the bank, it may not be termed as 
“fraud”.  I  believe  there  is  a  good  enough  reason  to  revisit  the  definition  of  “fraud”  in  the 
banking context. 
Fixing of staff accountability 
21.  Another  area  demanding  urgent  attention  of  banks  is  fixing  of  staff  accountability.  Our 
analysis  has  revealed  that  this  is  a  neglected  area  so  far  as  public  sector  banks  are 
concerned. The general trend in such cases is to include a large number of officials in the 
probe  so  that  the  investigation  is  both  delayed  and  diluted.  Even  in  instances  where 
investigations  are  concluded,  there  is  a  tendency  to  hold  only  the  junior  level  officials 
involved  in  post  disbursement  supervision  account  and  ignore  the  lapses  on  the  part  of 
higher officials who were involved in sanctioning of the advances, unless of course, the case 
becomes  a  high  profile  one  or  if  some  personal  vengeance  is  involved.  Our  experience  is 
that the accountability examinations do not comment on lapses of sanctioning officials even 
while  the  fraudulent  intentions  of  the  borrower  might  have  been  overlooked  by  the 
sanctioning officials ab initio. I have heard arguments such as how can the Board or the Top 
Management  be  expected  to  conduct  post  disbursal  supervision?  It  can,  at  best,  create  a 
structure that ensures that the post disbursal supervision is properly conducted. I can accept 
the argument to a certain extent but if the structure created by the Board/Top Management 
fails to do its job properly, who should be held accountable? The limited point that I want to 
make is, if the Board/Senior Management does not have the time to conduct post disbursal 
supervision, why not delegate the sanction authority also to a lower level. 
22.  I  have  another  issue  regarding  fixing  of  staff  accountability  in  advance  related  fraud 
cases. We have observed that in the same case of consortium/ multiple financing, while staff 
accountability is established in a few banks, in several others, the banks do not find any staff 
involvement. To me, this defies logic. How can the banks shift the onus of conducting due 
diligence on the consortium leader and blindly follow whatever the latter does? 
23.  I  believe  there  is  a  pressing  need  to  probe  staff  accountability  in  a  fair  and  objective 
manner  and  take  it  to  its  logical  conclusion.  This  is  necessary  to  instill  a  sense  of 
responsibility  amongst  the  officials  for  complying  with  the  laid  down  procedures.  Many  a 
times,  the  internal  investigation  is  put  on  hold  when  the  probe  is  handed  over  to  external 
8 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
investigation  agencies.  The  completion  of  internal  probe  would  also  assist  in  prompt 
investigation by the law enforcement agencies and the perpetrators of fraud can be brought 
to book. Our analysis also shows that the law enforcement agencies are, at times, reluctant 
to accept the cases for probe, either on technical grounds or other constraints, due to which 
precious  time  is  lost  in  initiating  the  probe  leading  to  consequential  dilution  in  quality  of 
evidence,  increased  complexity  in  tracking  money  trails  and  deterioration  in  enforceable 
collateral. 
24.  While  it  is  important  that  the  probing  and  fixing  of  staff  accountability  be  done  in  all 
seriousness, I also wish to add a note of caution here. We all know that the banks are in the 
business of taking risk and consequently, there may be occasions when the risk crystallizes 
and bank suffers losses on some of their credit decisions. Herein lies a need to differentiate 
between the losses which the bank suffers in its normal course of business and those which 
might  have  resulted  from  fraudulent  actions.  While  fixing  accountability,  there  would  be  a 
need  to  categorically  establish  mala  fide  intention/  malfeasance  on  the  part  of  the  erring 
employee  involved  in  fraud  cases  so  that  the  other  officials  do  not  become  wary  of 
sanctioning even good credit proposals. 
Expectations of the supervisor 
25. Good  Corporate Governance  serves  as  a  very  important factor  in  control  of fraudulent 
activities. RBI has clearly indicated that fraud risk management, fraud monitoring and fraud 
investigation function must be owned by the bank’s CEO, Audit Committee of the Board and, 
in  respect  of  large  value  frauds,  the  Special  Committee  of  the  Board.  The  role  of  the 
Chairmen  and  Managing  Directors(CMDs)/  Chief  Executive  Officers  (CEOs),  Audit 
Committee of the Board and the Special Committee of the Board in evolving robust fraud risk 
management  systems  and  in  implementing  effective  fraud  risk  mitigating  measures  is  of 
paramount  importance. They  are  responsible  for  effective  investigation  of fraud  cases  and 
prompt,  accurate  reporting  to  appropriate  regulatory  and  law  enforcement  authorities.  The 
Boards of the banks/ ACB should ensure periodical review of the procedures and processes 
to ensure that the bank’s interests are not impacted adversely due to loopholes in their policy 
guidelines. It is imperative that the Top Management puts in place targeted fraud awareness 
training for its employees focusing on prevention and detection of fraud. 
26.  It  is  a  matter  of  concern  that  the  audit  systems  prevalent  in  banks  have  not  proved 
effective  in  detecting  fraud  cases  due  to  factors  like  inadequacy  of  time  allotted  for  audit, 
inefficient sampling of transactions to be checked during audit, lack of trained personnel with 
the required aptitude for audit work, etc. Providing individuals a means to report suspicious 
activity is a critical part  of an anti-fraud program. Towards this end, a system of protected 
disclosure  scheme  has  been  evolved  which  is  regulated  by  CVC  in  case  of  public  sector 
banks and RBI in case of private and foreign banks. Reserve Bank has also advised private 
and  foreign  banks  operating  in  India  to  upgrade  their  internal  vigilance  mechanism  to  the 
same level as is applicable in case of public sector banks in terms of CVC guidelines in the 
matter. 
27. Information sharing is a vital fraud prevention and alert mechanism. On its part, Reserve 
Bank promptly shares information with all banks detailing the modus operandi of fraud cases 
reported by any bank together with details of the entities involved in the perpetration of such 
frauds  in  the  form  of  confidential  caution  advices.  This  also  serves  to  encourage  periodic 
review  of  existing guidelines,  identify  loopholes  on  the  basis  of  caution advice,  if  any,  and 
initiate corrective steps. Reserve Bank has also issued instructions requiring banks to report 
negligence  or  involvement  of  entities  like  Chartered  Accountants,  valuers  and  advocates 
resulting  in  perpetration  of  frauds,  to  their  professional  oversight  bodies  for  appropriate 
deterrent action. 
28.  Today,  most  banks  have  put  in  place  a  system  of  checking  the  credit  history  of  the 
borrower  through  credit  information  companies  like  the  CIBIL.  Considering  that  fraudulent 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 9 
borrowers could still seek credit from the banking system even after defrauding one bank, it 
may be worthwhile to consider setting up a fraud registry on the lines of credit information 
bureau.  This,  coupled  with  stringent  deterrents  such  as  prohibition  of  banking  facilities  to 
fraudulent borrowers, may serve as a strong antidote to the malaise. 
Conclusion 
29. The impact of frauds on entities like banks, which are engaged in financial activities, is 
more  significant  as  their  operations  involve  intermediation  of  funds.  The  economic  cost  of 
frauds  can  be  huge  in  terms  of  likely  disruption  in  the  working  of  the  markets,  financial 
institutions,  and  the  payment  system.  Besides,  frauds  can  have  a  potentially  debilitating 
effect on confidence in the banking system and may damage the integrity and stability of the 
economy. It can bring down banks, undermine the central bank’s supervisory role and even 
create social unrest, discontent and political upheavals. The vulnerability of banks to fraud 
has been heightened by technological advancements in recent times. 
30. I would like to recapitulate some of the key issues that I have sought to highlight in my 
address today: 
• 
While the number of frauds reported each year is actually coming down, the amount 
involved  is  going  up  substantially.  The  increase  in  amount  involved  is  largely 
attributable  to  the few  large  value  advance  related frauds  that  come  to  light  each 
year.  The  small  value  technology  related  and  other  transactional  frauds,  as  a 
proportion to the number of daily banking transactions, are very miniscule and are 
manageable. 
The  large  value  advance  related  frauds,  which  pose  a  significant  challenge  to  all 
stakeholders, are mainly concentrated in the public sector banks. 
While  there  is  a  pressing  need  to  overhaul  the  system  of  monitoring,  control, 
supervision and follow up of advances related frauds, their incidence in public sector 
banks  in  a  large  measure  can  also  be  trailed  to  comparatively  poor  corporate 
governance  standards  and  lack  of  firm  resolve  by  the  Board  and  the  Top 
Management in fighting this menace. 
There  is  a  need  to  improve  exchange  of  information  between  all  stakeholders  to 
instill  and  maintain  financial  discipline  among  the  users  of  funds  and  prevent 
negative information arbitrage to the detriment of the system 
Board oversight of the audit processes and the internal systems and control must be 
able  to  identify  vulnerable  areas,  raise  red  flags  and  plug  loopholes  quickly  and 
effectively 
There  are  considerable  delays  in  reporting  frauds  to  appropriate  authorities, 
conducting  investigation  and  fixing  of  accountability,  which  in  effect  leads  to 
shielding  of  the  main  culprit  while  the  blame  is  shifted  to  the  junior  level  officials. 
This trend needs to be curbed immediately. Close liaison must be maintained with 
investigating agencies and courts to ensure timely completion of investigations and 
closure of cases 
Society should demand stringent action against the perpetrators of financial frauds 
and should socially ostracize them 
Banking system should collectively ensure that the fraudsters do not have access to 
banking facilities 
       31. To sum up, I would like to emphasize that the advantages of technology, communication 
and accessibility of data must be leveraged to put in place a system wide fraud mitigation 
mission. Any house is only as strong as its foundation and as weather proof as its insulation. 
It is necessary, therefore, that a strong foundation is built by leveraging robust IT systems, 
10 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
framing effective policies and procedures, laying down strict compliance processes, setting 
high  integrity  standards,  developing  efficient  monitoring  capabilities  and  initiating  strict 
punitive  action  against  the  culprits  in  a  time  bound  manner.  It  is  also  imperative  that  we 
insulate  ourselves  from  unscrupulous  activities  by  strengthening  the  fraud  detection, 
mitigation and control mechanism through prompt identification, investigation and exchange 
of information. This is necessary not just for the safety of banks but for ensuring the stability 
and  resilience  of  the  overall  financial  system  and  sustaining  the  confidence  that  various 
stakeholders  have  in  its  strength  and  integrity.  To  my  mind,  in  improved  Governance 
standards  in  the  public  sector  banks  and  greater  commitment  by  the  Board  and  Top 
Management in fighting the scourge of fraud lies the “holy grail” of success. 
I thank ASSOCHAM for inviting me to the Inaugural session of this conference and wish the 
conference deliberations a grand success. 
Thank you!
