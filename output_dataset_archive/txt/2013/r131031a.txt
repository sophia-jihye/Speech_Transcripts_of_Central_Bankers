Rodrigo Vergara: Chile’s latest Monetary Policy Report 
Presentation by Mr Rodrigo Vergara, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, of the Monetary 
Policy Report before the Honorable Senate of the Republic, Santiago de Chile, 4 September 
2013. 
 The  Monetary  Policy  Report  of  September  2013  can  be  found  at  http://www.bcentral.cl. 
Accompanying figures and tables can be found at the end of the speech. 
Mister  President  of  the  Senate,  Senator  Jorge  Pizarro,  honorable  senators,  ladies, 
gentlemen, 
Thank you for inviting the Board of the Central Bank of Chile to present our Monetary Policy 
Report.  Each  September,  this  presentation  coincides  with  the  annual  report  of  the  Central 
Bank to the Senate, where we share our vision on the recent macroeconomic and financial 
developments  in  Chile  and  the  world,  together  with  the  economic-financial  outlook  and  its 
implications on monetary policy. 
When I presented our Monetary Policy Report to the Senate’s Finance Committee in early 
July, I said that the world economy had begun to move towards a more normal configuration, 
with a more balanced growth outlook between developed and emerging countries, and where 
the terms of trade and financial conditions would not be as favorable to Chile as they had 
been for some years. This scenario would imply a lower external stimulus to our economy 
and increased volatility in international financial markets in the short term, but at the same 
time it contained some positive elements such as recovering growth in developed economies 
and more normal international interest rates, which would help achieve a more sustainable 
global economy in the medium term. 
In recent months, the world has continued to advance towards a more balanced situation, but 
it has also unveiled some of the risks we pointed out last July. Some countries have been 
more volatile in this transition, as reflected in strong devaluations of their currencies, higher 
interest rates, downward adjustments in growth expectations and capital outflows (figure 1). 
The  list  includes  some  of  the  biggest  emerging  economies  like  Brazil,  India,  Indonesia, 
Turkey and South Africa. This reflects a combination of a lower monetary stimulus expected 
in  the  U.S.  with  the  vulnerabilities  that  were  created  in  previous  years  in  some  emerging 
economies.  The  latter  include  greater  reliance  on  external  funding,  currency  mismatches, 
fiscal imbalances, rapid growth in domestic credit and relatively high inflation rates. These 
shortcomings  mean  less  room  to  maneuver  economic  policies  to  compensate  for  the 
deterioration in the external scenario. Several economies that had intervened very actively to 
prevent exchange rate appreciations have begun to act now to curb the depreciation of their 
currencies. Brazil, for example, announced an intervention amounting to 60 billion dollars by 
the end of the year, while India has introduced capital controls to grapple with the sharp fall 
in  the  rupee.  An  important  risk  we  highlight  in  this  Report  is  an  intensification  of  financial 
volatility and the slowdown in the growth of emerging economies. In Chile, the effects of this 
greater  international  volatility  have  so  far  been  limited  and  have  manifested  mainly  in  the 
depreciation of the peso and a stock market downturn. 
Another important source of risk that we consider in this Report is related to China. As we 
have mentioned time and again, the evolution of this economy concerns us not only for its 
importance as driver of global growth, but also for its impact on exports from Chile and, in 
particular, the price of copper, since China is the largest copper consumer in the world. In 
recent times there have been doubts about the situation of their financial system, especially 
after  the  strong  growth  in  bank  credit  and  non-bank  intermediation  from  2009  onwards. 
Another source of risk is the behavior of oil prices because of the geopolitical situation in the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 1
Middle  East.  Moreover,  although  there  are  encouraging  signs  from  the  Eurozone,  risks 
remain associated with its complex political, fiscal and financial outlook. 
These external risks are important enough for us to evaluate that Chile’s economic growth 
risks  are  biased  downward.  The  challenges  from  abroad  are  diverse,  but  as  we  have 
mentioned several times, the Chilean economy is well prepared to face them. As a country 
we have worked for years in strengthening a solid institutional framework with an economic 
policy scheme based on inflation targeting and a floating exchange rate, with a fiscal rule, a 
well regulated and supervised financial system, and trade and financial openness. 
As we have said on other occasions, our scheme of inflation targeting and floating exchange 
rate  allows  us  to  better  cope  with  fluctuations  in  international  markets.  The  float  facilitates 
early and flexible adjustment of relative prices to changes in the external environment and 
prevents  distortions  in  the  decisions  on  external  financing  and  exchange-rate  hedging  of 
companies and financial institutions in Chile. The recent depreciation of the peso is going in 
the right direction to help the economy to adjust. Furthermore, the credibility of the inflation 
targeting framework grants flexibility to the central bank to make changes to the monetary 
policy  and  the  cost  of  credit  if  so  required  by  the  macroeconomic  scenario,  along  with 
allowing adjustments to the nominal and real exchange rate. 
In order for us to grasp these benefits in times of shortage, we need to act consistently in 
times of abundance. We have often been confronted with social pressures to intervene the 
exchange  rate  market  or  lower  the  interest  rate  to  prevent  an  appreciation  of  the  peso, 
following the example of countries that are more active in this field. While recognizing that 
overreactions  can  occur  in  the  short  term  in  either  direction  that  could  warrant  such  an 
intervention, we need to be aware that it entails carry costs for the Central Bank and affects 
the overall economy. 
Focusing on keeping inflation near the target and preserving the flexibility of the exchange 
rate in times of bonanza allows the peso to accommodate conditions like the present ones 
and adjust more efficiently to the new situation. We also know that exchange rate flexibility 
plays a critical role in preventing currency mismatches, which have taken such a great toll 
elsewhere in the region and in Chile in the past. Overall, the appreciation of the peso that we 
saw a few months back was milder than that of other currencies, so now the depreciation has 
not been as sharp either. 
Domestically, monetary policy has continued to face many short-term challenges. The sound 
economic  slowdown  we  were  expecting  has  been  gradually  occurring.  On  the  expenditure 
side, however, consumption continues to be very strong, boosted by labor market conditions. 
Actually, the latest indicators confirm the strength of the labor market. 
The information we have reviewed for this Report suggests that this component of domestic 
demand will moderate in the coming quarters, but we must not overlook the risk of a slower 
than expected adjustment of consumption, affecting the use of domestic resources and the 
deficit of the current account of the balance of payments. 
In this context, the Board has held the MPR at 5%, but noting that if these trends consolidate 
adjustments to the policy rate may be required. 
Let me now describe for you our baseline scenario for the Chilean economy and the main 
risks examined in our Report. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
International  trends  depicted  in  June  have  settled.  News  coming  from  the  developed 
economies, particularly the United States, confirms a gradual recovery. The revision of U.S. 
economic figures lowered the growth forecast for the whole year, but showed that the U.S. 
economy  picked  up  sooner  than  expected.  In  the  second  quarter  it  accelerated  thanks  to 
increased investments in fixed assets, a steady improvement in the labor market and more 
2

optimistic expectations of consumers and enterprises. In addition, the markets foresee that 
the Fed will anticipate the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus in place. The recovery of the 
Japanese  economy  continues,  but  questions  remain  regarding  its  sustainability.  After 
six quarters  of  contraction,  the  Eurozone  recorded  positive  growth  in  the  second  quarter, 
driven  by  Germany  and  France,  and  also  favored  by  the  economies  of  the  periphery  that 
moderated their contractions. However, it is still premature to conclude a change in trend. 
The  emerging  world,  on  the  other  hand,  has  continued  to  show  widespread  deceleration. 
China settled in lower growth figures, despite some signs of stabilizing output and messages 
from  the  authorities  that  they  will  sustain  an  economic  expansion  of  7%  annually. 
Accordingly,  our  baseline  scenario  has  revised  the  growth  outlook  for  the  world  and  our 
trading partners for 2013 and 2014 slightly downward (table 1). 
The portfolio realignment originating in the transition to a more balanced configuration of the 
external  scenario  has  not  been  without  volatility,  which  again  was  evident  in  the  weeks 
before the close of this Report. Although the authorities of the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) 
have  pointed  out  that  the  unconventional  stimulus  program  will  be  withdrawn  gradually  
– helping to tone down the reaction of the markets – most recently volatility has been on the 
rise. Capital flows to emerging economies have retreated and become costlier, especially in 
the  most  vulnerable  economies.  The  U.S.  dollar  depreciated  against  the  currencies  of 
developed economies, but appreciated in the emerging world. As I said at the beginning of 
this presentation, the latter has complicated macroeconomic management in some countries 
because of its inflationary and financial effects, and has led to reverse previously adopted 
exchange rate interventions. In the developed markets, long-term interest rates have risen 
again, internalizing that the Fed will soon begin reducing its asset purchases. 
In  Chile,  since  our  June  Report,  domestic  output  and  demand  have  continued  with  the 
gradual normalization process that began this year, growing less than in 2012 for the second 
consecutive quarter. In the second quarter, GDP expanded 4.1%, confirming the slowdown 
(figure  2).  The  natural  resources  sector  reduced  its  annual  growth  rate  by  more  than  two 
points compared with the previous quarter, primarily related to lower mine production early in 
the quarter, but also to the significant drop in fishery. Sectors other than natural resources 
performed  below  trend  in  the  second  quarter.  Growth  was  mainly  driven  by  trade  and 
construction, while other areas linked to investment slowed. Installed capacity utilization has 
declined accordingly. 
Domestic demand slowed down further in the second quarter. Final demand, however, which 
excludes  inventories,  continued  to  grow  at  the  same  pace  of  the  first  quarter.  Gross  fixed 
capital formation posted y-o-y expansion flat from the first quarter of this year, but below the 
figures of the second half of 2012. As has been noted before, this slowdown owes mainly to 
the maturing of mining investments after three years largely outperforming GDP. Also in an 
external context where the copper price has dropped and moderating expectations for growth 
around  the  world  but  especially  in  China,  which  call  for  more  caution  when  evaluating 
investment decisions. On the other hand, private consumption was more dynamic, especially 
in its non-durable component, while durables remained high. Labor market conditions have 
continued to tighten, but are still the main driver of this component. Nominal and real wages 
have  moderated  their  annual  variation,  while  the  unemployment  rate  remains  near  all-time 
lows. Again, unlike previous cycles, credit growth has accompanied private income, but has 
not  been  the  main  determinant  of  household  spending.  This  last  quarter  saw  a  significant 
depletion of inventories, reversing the opposite trend seen in the first quarter of the year, due 
to, among other factors, the effects of the port strike. 
As forecast, CPI inflation has returned to the tolerance range, as the temporary factors that 
affected it have eased (figure 3). In particular, the prices of electricity and gasoline rose, the 
former  due  to  the  end  of  price  recalculations,  the  latter  because  of  world  prices  and,  to  a 
lesser  extent,  the  exchange  rate  depreciation.  Yet  the  core  measure  –  CPIEFE,  which 
excludes  foods  and  energy  –  has  remained  near  1%  annually,  affected  by  the  persistent 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

negative incidence of the goods component. Inflation expectations two years ahead remain 
close to 3% annually. 
Although  the  Board  has  held  the  MPR  constant,  there  have  been  variations  in  domestic 
interest  rates  and  the  real  exchange  rate  that  smooth  the  economy’s  adjustment  to  a 
scenario of lower external impulse and less pressures on internal resources. Market interest 
rates  have  dropped  in  the  year  so  far.  The  real  exchange  rate  (RER)  has  depreciated, 
approaching its average of the past 15 to 20 years, and is believed to be within the range 
consistent with its long-term fundamentals (figure 4). 
The baseline scenario assumes that Chile’s GDP will grow between 4.0 and 4.5% this year. 
This range is consistent with assumptions in last June’s Report. In 2014, growth should be in 
the 4.0 to 5.0% range. The baseline scenario reflects the slowdown in output that has been 
occurring  during  the  year.  It  also  assumes  that  investment  will  moderate  further  as  the 
investment cycle is completed, consistently with adjustments seen in business surveys and 
investment plans. Consumption is expected to slow gradually because of the still strong labor 
market and the relative stability of household saving during the expansionary phase of the 
cycle.  Consumer  expectations  are  less  optimistic  these  past  few  months  and  are 
approaching neutrality, which will help moderate this component of expenditure. So will the 
slower  pace  of  marginal  job  creation,  particularly  salaried  work,  and  the  slowdown  of  real 
wages.  Coupled  with  this  is  the  depreciation  of  the  real  exchange  rate  which  will  affect 
durable  consumption.  Also,  moderating  investment  will  help  to  take  pressure  off  the  labor 
market. Finally, there is the foreseen reduction in the impulse from abroad (table 2). 
Inflation is expected to continue to grow steadily to reach 3% during the first half of 2014 and 
and be stable until the end of the projection horizon, this time the third quarter of 2015. The 
CPIEFE  will  take  somewhat  longer  to  hit  3%.  The  underlying  assumption  is  that  nominal 
wages  will  rise  in  line  with  productivity  and  the  inflation  target.  There  is  also  the 
methodological  assumption  that  the  RER  will  remain  near  its  recent  values.  Finally,  the 
baseline scenario uses as a working assumption that the MPR will follow a path similar to the 
one implicit in expectations surveys available at the closing of this Report (figure 5). 
The baseline scenario reflects the developments that the Board believes to be the most likely 
to occur with the information at hand at the statistical closing of the Report. However, there 
are  risk  scenarios  that,  if  materialized,  might  change  the  macroeconomic  outlook  and, 
therefore,  the  course  of  monetary  policy.  On  this  occasion,  after  evaluating  the  alternative 
scenarios,  the  Board  estimates  that  the  risk  balance  is  downward  biased  for  output  and 
unbiased for inflation. 
On the global front, a first risk comes from China, namely the fragility of its financial system, 
among  other  factors.  As  I  said  at  the  beginning,  the  banks’  off-balance-sheet  financial 
intermediation has been increasing and credit has accumulated enormous growth in the past 
few  years,  with  a  substantial  portion  going  to  local  governments.  In  other  economies, 
episodes of rapid credit growth have resulted a few years down the line in a deterioration of 
the quality of banking assets and financial intermediaries’ balance sheets, and in a slowdown 
in  domestic  demand.  Although  the  Chinese  financial  system  has  some  features  that 
differentiate  it  from  others,  there  is  no  denying  that  any  difficulties  in  this  field  could  have 
negative effects on China’s growth for a longer period. If so, it would hurt world growth and 
commodity prices, particularly for copper. 
A  second  risk  coming  from  abroad  has  to  do  with  the  way  emerging  economies  will 
accommodate  the  withdrawal  of  monetary  stimulus  packages  in  developed  countries.  The 
credit  conditions  facing  emerging  economies  have  tightened,  which  is  causing  financial, 
exchange-rate  and  inflationary  difficulties  in  those  where  vulnerabilities  built  up  during  the 
boom. Special attention deserve the economies with high external financing needs, including 
not  only  emerging  ones  but  also  some  in  peripheral  Europe.  Finally,  there  is  still  the  risk 
associated  with  the  complex  fiscal  and  financial  situation  of  the  Eurozone.  Add  to  this  the 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
intensifying  geopolitical  tensions  in  the  Middle  East,  which  could  significantly  affect  the  oil 
price, causing negative effects on world growth and higher pressures on fuel inflation. 
In  Chile,  although  the  economic  slowdown  is  underway,  it  is  possible  that  final  demand, 
particularly  private  consumption,  continues  to  adjust  at  a  slower-than-desired  pace, 
increasing the risk of higher inflation and a constant or growing current-account deficit. The 
risk  of  a  wider  current-account  deficit  would  increase  in  a  scenario  of  further  deteriorated 
terms  of  trade.  However,  as  we  have  pointed  out  before,  this  deficit  comes  largely  from 
investment  flows  into  the  tradable  sector  –  especially  mining  –  financed  by  foreign  direct 
investment.  The  recent  slowdown  of  investment  and  the  exchange  rate  depreciation  are 
some  of  the  adjustments  needed.  Moreover,  the  evidence  shown  in  a  box  in  this  Report 
suggests that the mining investment cycle is maturing. This will moderate domestic demand 
and  pressures  over  internal  resources,  the  labor  market  and  imports  of  capital  goods. 
Meanwhile, the startup of mining projects has driven volume exports up. All of this points at 
more favorable current-account balances in the medium term. Anyway, for the purposes of 
assessing  this  risk  we  also  need  to  review  the  evolution  of  the  deficit  measured  at  trend 
prices. In this sense, news is pointing in the right direction, because the estimate for this year 
went from 5.7% of GDP last March, to 4.9% in this Report. We estimate that in 2014 it will 
continue to recede to 4.6% of GDP. 
The international economy is undergoing a normalization process that influences the Chilean 
economy. This means a lower external impulse, with more balanced world growth between 
developed  and  emerging  economies,  terms  of  trade  approaching  their  long-term  level  and 
global  financial  conditions  more  in  line  with  historic  patterns.  A  smaller  boost  from  foreign 
investment is also to be expected – especially in mining –, which will take pressure off the 
current-account deficit and the use of internal resources. Monetary policy is well equipped, if 
so required, to back this adjustment process. The Board follows closely the evolution of the 
external  and  domestic  macroeconomic  scenario  and  its  implications  on  inflation,  and 
reaffirms  its  commitment  to  conduct  monetary  policy  so  that  projected  inflation  stands  at 
3% over the policy horizon. 
I would like to end by sharing with you some final thoughts. 
Final thoughts 
We  have  been  19  months  with  the  same  monetary  policy  interest  rate.  And  as  with  the 
exchange  rate,  during  this  time  we  have  received  the  most  diverse  recommendations  and 
suggestions  from  the  market.  From  taking  prompt  action  to  prevent  the  economy  from 
overheating to acting just as promptly to avoid deterioration. In this dilemma, we have always 
opted  for  a  medium-  to  long-run  look  over  the  short-term  ups  and  downs,  and  therefore 
considered all the risks involved. So far this has allowed us to properly anticipate events and 
stick to what we believe has been the right monetary policy. 
The international conjuncture puts us to the test; we have identified many risks in this area. 
Over  the  months  they  have  increased  in  both  variety  and  origins.  We  know  that  we  are 
prepared to face them in the best way possible. It is impossible to be immune. In fact, a small 
open economy like Chile is always subject to the vagaries of the international economy: it 
could not be otherwise. However, policy makers should be able to overcome them without 
major setbacks. 
There  are  also  challenges  within  our  borders,  especially  doubts  about  the  evolution  of  a 
number  of  variables,  such  as  employment  and  consumption,  among  others.  It  is  precisely 
this medium- to long-term vision what helps us not to make hasty decisions. We have said 
that we are ready to take action if necessary, but overreacting to one particular event would 
be tantamount to throwing away the well-earned credibility of the Central Bank, which is a 
fundamental anchor to achieve our goal of safeguarding the stability of the price level and the 
financial system.

In short, the country is prepared to face a somewhat less favorable external scenario next 
year, which undoubtedly will have effects on the domestic economy. For years we have built 
solid  macroeconomic  balances,  which  yield  their  fruit  when  adverse  situations  hit.  We  are 
confident that, in such a scenario, this will be no exception. Our institutions, solid but flexible 
at the same time, distinguish us in the world. This allows us to look at the country’s future 
with calm and optimism. We as central bank will continue to contribute our own efforts to the 
stability  of  the  currency  and  the  normal  functioning  of  the  internal  and  external  payment 
system, the development and welfare of the Chilean population. 
Thank you.
