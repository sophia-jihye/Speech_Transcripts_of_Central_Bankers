Introduction 
Mr.  President  of  the  Senate’s  Finance  Commission,  Senator  Andrés  Zaldívar,  senators 
members of this Commission, ladies and gentlemen. 
I  am  grateful  for  your  invitation  to  present  the  vision  of  the  Central  Bank’s  Board  on  the 
recent macroeconomic and financial developments, its Outlook and implications on monetary 
and  financial  policy.  This  vision  is  contained  in  detail  in  our  December  Monetary  Policy 
Report and our second-half Financial Stability Report we are presenting now. 
The macroeconomic scenario has evolved along the trends described in the latest Monetary 
Policy Reports. In the external scenario, growth is more balanced between developed and 
emerging  economies  than  it  was  before  the  subprime  crisis  hit.  International  financial 
conditions are steadily normalizing, while the terms of trade are declining and approaching 
their trend values.  
In this scenario, the Chilean economy will receive a milder boost from abroad than we saw in 
recent  years.  The  less  expansionary  monetary  policies  in  the  developed  world  will  be 
coupled with a rebound in developed economies that will favor not only these countries but 
the  world  economy  at  large.  Certainly,  some  countries  have  more  reasons  to  worry  than 
others  about  these  adjustments  in  the  world  economy,  because  of  their  external  and 
domestic vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, the past and present volatility of the world will continue 
to affect our economy, but, while we are certainly not immune to what happens outside our 
borders, we feel we are on a good stand to deal with this transition. 
At  home,  output  and  demand  are  gradually  decelerating  and  inflation  is  still  low.  Our 
projections,  which  I  will  be  reviewing  shortly,  indicate  that  in  the  short  term  the  Chilean 
economy will continue to expand somewhat below trend, affected by the normalization of the 
mining investment cycle and labor market conditions. We thus estimate a 4.2 percent growth 
for this year and a 3.75 to 4.75 percent range for next. This 2014 forecast range is slightly 
less  than  what  we  were  expecting  in  September.  Although these growth  rates represent  a 
slowdown from previous years, we see no obstacles ahead that could prevent our economy 
from resuming growth at closer to trend rates, which we continue to estimate at 5 percent 
annually. 
In this context, the Board decided to lower the monetary policy rate from 5 to 4.5 percent in 
its meetings of October and November, in order to accommodate the monetary stimulus to 
our slower economy and not jeopardize the convergence of inflation to the target. The recent 
reduction of the MPR is part of a necessary adjustment to deal with recent changes in our 
macroeconomy and, as I said, ensure compliance with our inflation objective. Going forward, 
further changes to the MPR will depend on incoming information and its implications on the 
economy’s  evolution.  Actually,  the  baseline  scenario  does  not  foresee  the  need  for  any 
significant changes in the MPR but, should such need arise, monetary policy has room and is 
prepared for further adjustments.

Over the period, both the real and the nominal exchange rates have depreciated, which is 
part  of  the  process  of  restructuring  the  sources  of  growth  after  some  time  when  domestic 
demand has been the primary driver of such growth. 
Let me now describe for you our baseline scenario and the main risks we have identified in 
our reports. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
Chile’s  third-quarter  growth  was  4.7  percent  y-o-y.  Mining  grew  strongly,  boosted  by  the 
startup of major investment projects of recent years. Thus, mining exports have increased, 
helping  to  reduce  the  current  account  deficit.  Sectors  other  than  natural  resources, 
meanwhile, continued to post lower growth rates than in 2012 (figure 1). This, together with 
the revision to growth rates of earlier quarters, confirmed that the Chilean economy has lost 
some strength compared with last year. 
On  the  expenditure  side,  the  slowdown  extended  to  each  and  every  component,  including 
private consumption, which was accompanied with significant inventory depletion (figure 2). 
In  this  trajectory,  the  maturation  of  the  mining  investment  cycle  discussed  in  previous 
Reports has played a major role. In addition, the extraordinary imports of transport materials 
of the last quarter of 2012 did not continue into this year, and imports of other capital goods 
were  weak  in  the  past  few  months.  Consumption  has  also  slowed  down,  although  its 
adjustment  has  proceeded  gradually,  because  of  still  tight  labor  market  conditions,  real 
wages growing strongly and consumer expectations still optimistic, although less so than in 
the  first  half  of  the  year.  The  deceleration  of  private  consumption  is  expected  to  continue 
over the coming months coupled with a not so strong labor market, a vision that is grounded 
on our business perception report Informe de Percepciones de Negocios. 
CPI  inflation  has  been  below  expectations,  mainly  reflecting  the  drop  in  international  fuel 
prices, which more than offset the seasonal price increases of some perishable foods and 
the  peso  depreciation.  Thus,  in  October  the  CPI  rose  1.5%  y-o-y,  which  again  placed  it 
temporarily  below  the  tolerance  range.  In  contrast,  the  core  measure  CPIEFE  brought  no 
major  surprises  and  continued  to  increase  up  to  1.6%  annually  in  the  same  month.  Two 
years ahead inflation expectations remain around 3% (figure 3). 
In the international financial markets, movements in the last few months have been largely 
determined  by  news  about  the  future  course  of  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  in  the  United 
States. Recall that, after the signs delivered by the Federal Reserve last May, the withdrawal 
of  the  monetary  stimulus  was  expected  to  begin  in  September.  This  drove  up  long-term 
interest rates by more than 100 basis points in the U.S., the currencies depreciated against 
the  dollar  and  volatility  increased,  with  particularly  harsh  effects  on  emerging  economies. 
Later on, as such withdrawal did not occur in September, interest rates receded some and 
calm  returned  to  the  markets.  Although  this  resulted  in  some  improvement  of  the  external 
lending standards to emerging economies, our baseline scenario considers the possibility of 
recurrent episodes of volatility during the transition towards more normal financial conditions. 
For one thing, the temporary nature of the U.S. fiscal agreements could bring new tensions in 
early 2014, although this seems less likely.  
At any rate, external lending conditions are less favorable than they were early in the year. 
Compared with September, long-term interest rates dropped as the Federal Reserve kept the 
asset purchase plan unchanged, and at the same time international stock markets improved. 
Several  emerging  market  currencies  depreciated  against  the  dollar  –  the  Chilean  peso 
included  –  which  was  trading  at more than  $520  per  dollar  in  November  and  has  recently 
surpassed  $530.  The  real  exchange  rate,  as  I  said,  has  risen  to  near  its  15  to  20  years’ 
average. 
In  terms  of  the  outlook  for  global  growth,  developed  economies  are  still  in  a  process  of 
gradual  recovery.  In  the  third  quarter,  the  U.S.  exceeded  market  consensus  expectations

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
and,  although  inventory  accumulation  played  a  part,  the  improved  performance  of  the 
housing  and 
labor  markets,  combined  with  better  entrepreneurial  and  consumer 
expectations,  the  behavior  of  stock  and  other  asset  prices  and,  in  particular,  the  lower 
intensity of the fiscal adjustment suggest that next year the country will outperform its 2013 
figures.  The  recovery  of  the  Japanese  economy  is  still  ongoing,  but  the  tax  increases 
announced for 2014 will taper economic growth. The Eurozone posted positive growth for the 
second  consecutive  quarter,  although  less  than  expected  by  the  consensus. Worth  noting 
were the slower growth of Germany and the contraction of the French economy and, on a 
positive note, that some of the peripheral economies grew again. 
Emerging  economies  have  slowed  down  further  and  consensus  forecasts  have  seen  new 
downward revisions. In China, after a substantial correction to its growth projections in the 
first half of the year, recent data show growth stabilizing around 7.5 percent, quite less than 
in  recent  years,  however.  The  baseline  scenario  assumes  that  the  Chinese  economy  will 
slow further to reach 7.2 percent annually in 2015, which points to the need to continue to 
restructure  its  sources  of  growth  and  resolve  some  of  the  vulnerabilities  of  its  financial 
system.  
In  the  rest  of  the  emerging  world,  economic  activity  continues  to  moderate,  leading  some 
economies to lower their benchmark rates. Others, however, have restricted their monetary 
policies  responding  to  higher  inflationary  and  exchange  rate  pressures  related  to  fiscal, 
monetary  or  external  vulnerabilities.  Anyway,  the  slower  growth  expected  in  China,  lower 
commodity  prices,  less  expansionary  international  financial  conditions,  the  contractionary 
adjustments  in  some  large  emerging  economies  and  the  need  to  progress  in  the 
strengthening of the Chinese financial system plus its growth re-composition are behind the 
vision that emerging economies will expand at a slower pace than during the last three years. 
The  baseline  scenario  of  our  Monetary  Policy  Report  foresees  that,  after  expanding  at 
3.4 percent in 2013, our trading partners will grow by 3.6 and 3.8 percent in 2014 and 2015, 
respectively, somewhat less than we thought in September. In this context, inflation has been 
below  expectations  in  both  emerging  and  developed  economies.  Commodity  prices  have 
dropped. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have eased with respect to a few months 
ago,  as  have  some  refinery  problems  in  the  United  States,  which  led  to  lower  actual  and 
expected  fuel  prices  compared  with  September.  The  copper  price,  after  remaining  fairly 
stable for some months, posted a decline in recent weeks, so the price outlook for the metal 
remains unchanged from the previous Report. Accordingly, the baseline scenario assumes 
that the terms of trade will not divert from those in the last Report (table 1). 
As I have already mentioned, our baseline scenario estimates that the Chilean economy will 
expand 4.2 percent in 2013, and between 3.75 and 4.75 percent in 2014, slightly less than 
forecast in September. In 2014, gross fixed capital formation will grow near the rate of this 
year.  As  for  consumption,  the  baseline  scenario  foresees  a  slight  deceleration  from  2013. 
This  forecast  combines,  on  one  hand,  a  moderation  in  private  income  growth,  inflation 
converging  to  3  percent  and  an  exchange  rate  depreciation  that  will  affect  durable 
consumption. On the other, still optimistic consumer expectations and a strong labor market 
–  although  not  as  tight  as  this  year  –  that  will  continue  to  underpin  consumption.  This 
scenario assumes an external impulse similar to September’s. Furthermore, it considers that 
part of the inventory depletion of recent quarters is an unwanted development, so it will be 
reversed  in  the  coming  months.  Taking  into  account  the  weaker  imports  and  stronger 
exports, this scenario also foresees a narrowing of the current account deficit compared with 
the September estimate: 3.2 percent of GDP this year and 3.7 percent in 2014. The surprise 
here – a positive one indeed – is that some of the trends that were anticipated in previous 
reports,  have  come  sooner  and  stronger.  In  particular,  the  maturation  of  the  mining 
investment  cycle,  which  has  been  one  of  the  main  sources  of  the  higher  deficit  due  to  its 
import component,  has allowed  copper  exports  to grow  beyond  expectations,  while  capital 
imports have begun to decline. The estimate of the current account deficit measured at trend

prices  is  also  adjusted  downward,  so  the  risk  associated  with  the  evolution  of  the  current 
account that had been identified in the last Monetary Policy Report is reduced (table 2). 
In  the  baseline  scenario,  CPI  inflation  will  converge  to  3  percent  towards  the  end  of  the 
projection  horizon,  this  time  the  last  quarter  of  2015.  Thus,  reaching  the  target  will  take 
longer  than  expected  in  September.  The  CPIEFE  will  continue  to  gradually  approach 
3 percent,  without  major  changes  from  the  September  forecast  (figure  4).  This  projection 
implies that nominal wages will be adjusted in line with productivity and the inflation target. It 
also includes as a methodological assumption that the RER will remain virtually unchanged. 
Finally, the baseline scenario uses as a working methodological assumption that the policy 
rate will follow a path similar to the one shown in the latest Economic Expectations Survey 
(figure 5). 
The baseline scenario reflects those events that are estimated to be the most likely to occur 
with the information at hand at the closing of this Report. There are risk scenarios, however, 
which  if  materialized,  may  reshape  the  macroeconomic  environment  and,  therefore,  may 
modify the course of monetary policy. On this opportunity, having evaluated the alternative 
scenarios, the Board estimates that the risk balance is unbiased for both output and inflation. 
On the external front, one risk relates to growth in emerging economies, particularly China. 
Concerns  persist  about  the  fragility  of  the  Chinese  financial  system,  which  together  with 
doubts about the evolution of real-estate prices could limit its future growth prospects. As has 
been noted before, China’s evolution is cause for unrest because of its weight in world GDP 
and its impact on the pricing of commodities, copper included. 
The  volatility  that  financial  markets  have  shown  in  recent  months  implies  that  ending  the 
quantitative easing in the U.S. will not be stress-free, especially because of the difficulty to 
calibrate the policy actions of this unprecedented process. In this regard, a major risk has to 
do  with  its  effects  on  some  of  the  larger  emerging  economies  that  have  accumulated 
macroeconomic  imbalances  and  are  more  dependent  on  external  financing.  The  risk 
associated  with  the  complex  interaction  between  weak  growth,  a  frail  fiscal  situation  and 
financial problems in Europe is still present. 
At home, headline inflation of recent quarters has been lower than forecast, and the moment 
when it will expectedly reach the target has been postponed time and again. While the recent 
cuts to the MPR will help inflation converge to 3 percent, if the widespread slowdown in all 
the demand components is confirmed, along with longer-lasting low inflation in the rest of the 
world  and  maybe  a  sharper  fall  in  international  fuel  prices  could  further  postpone  such 
convergence  to  3  percent.  However,  the  depreciation  of  the  peso  and  the  still  tight  labor 
market could work in the opposite direction. 
Projections  indicate  that  in  the  short  term  the  Chilean  economy  will  continue  to  expand 
somewhat below trend for still some quarters. However, labor market conditions and a faster 
recovery in inventories, among other factors, could result in a faster recovery of the economy 
that would bring it closer to its trend. 
In  the  Financial  Stability  Report  we  are  presenting  today,  the  same  risk  scenarios  coming 
from abroad that I have just identified are examined, this time from the perspective of their 
impact  on  our  domestic  economy’s  financial  stability.  We  conclude  that  of  the  three  risk 
scenarios described, the episode of volatility originating in the monetary stimulus withdrawal 
is  the  most  likely  to  occur.  However,  a  deepening  of  the  Eurozone  crisis  or  a  sharp 
deceleration  of  a  systemic  emerging  economy  would  have  stronger  effects  on  the  Chilean 
financial  system.  Especially  because,  as  I  have  noted,  the  withdrawal  of  the  monetary 
stimulus in the United States will come about when the U.S. economy’s improved growth is 
already confirmed. 
The  banking  industry’s  capital  levels  are  adequate  to  remain  solvent  before  a  significant 
deterioration of economic growth and financial conditions. Stress tests show that the banks’ 
current capital levels allow them to absorb potential losses generated by a macroeconomic 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
risk  scenario  that  combines  a  GDP  contraction  –  like  that  of  the  subprime  crisis  –  higher 
financial costs for the short and long term, and a sharp depreciation of the exchange rate. 
One  such  test  –  motivated  by  the  risk  scenarios  identified  in  the  process  of  monetary 
tapering in the U.S. – shows little exposure of the banking system to a sharp increase in the 
interest rates of long-term securities. 
Meanwhile,  households’  aggregate  borrowing  and  financial  burden  indicators  show  a 
marginal decline, although with some changes in the composition of the debt. The share of 
bank debt has increased compared with other credit providers, while total corporate debt is 
stable  as  a  ratio  to  GDP  and  the  financial  indicators  of  companies  reporting  to  the 
Superintendence of Securities and Insurance (SVS) are also fairly stable. Capital inflows to 
Chile continue to be dominated by FDI while aggregate solvency and liquidity figures are also 
stable. 
In this way, our general analysis of the domestic financial system yields that it is on a good 
standing  to  deal  with  the  risk  scenarios  described,  and  we  see  no  incubation  of  systemic 
risks  at  the  local  level.  This  explains,  in  part,  why  the  recent  volatility  episode  in  foreign 
financial markets had lesser effects on the Chilean financial system than in other emerging 
economies, where risks did incubate over the past few years. 
However, to maintain this resilience the different players making up the financial system must 
take  the  necessary  decisions  and  safeguards,  especially  considering  the  dynamism  of  the 
financial  sector.  One  first  firewall,  perhaps  the  most  important  one,  is  the  one  related  to 
corporate  stockholders,  who  should  establish  and  implement  clear  policies  aimed  at 
restricting  their  operating  risks  via  corporate  governance,  boards  and  management.  A 
second firewall is related to public institutions such as the Superintendences and the Central 
Bank, which have complementary roles in the monitoring, supervision and regulation of the 
financial system. The continual improvement of regulations and laws, as well as the search 
for  best  practices  at  the  global  level  is  one  objective  that  must  always  be  present  in  our 
actions. Within this monitoring role, our Financial Stability Report plays a key role. In it we 
identify developments which, if intensified, might create risks, or where we believe there is 
room to reduce residual risks.  
I  would  like  now  to  describe  some  of  these  developments  as  well  as  the  main  regulatory 
amendments that have been implemented during the last six months. 
In  our  Financial  Stability  Reports  a  couple  of  issues  ago  we  warned  about  some 
developments in the real estate sector which, if intensified, could become a source of risk. 
We  were  particularly  concerned  about  the  combination  of  dynamic  prices  with  a  credit 
acceleration  originating  in  this  sector.  In  this  context,  one  good  element  is  that  mortgage 
credit  growth  has  remained  stable,  with  no  relaxation  of  lending  standards  for  mortgage 
loans or credit to construction and real estate firms. However, housing price indexes are as 
dynamic  as  in  previous  periods,  in  a  scenario  of  high  demand  and  low  inventories. 
Meanwhile, the expected supply of office space continues to rise and is in historically high 
levels. In this context, it is important that all players involved consider in their investment and 
funding decisions that the current price and demand trends of the sector might not continue, 
especially considering the external risks described, the expected increase in supply and the 
economic slowdown. 
While total household debt over income has dropped, the available evidence suggests that 
bank debt remains dynamic, particularly in the middle to upper income homes. To the extent 
that banks properly evaluate and analyze the credit risks inherent in this segment, it should 
not  be  a  source  of  vulnerability.  However,  there  are  factors  that  could  contribute  to  an 
underestimation of these risks. First, rolling credits have been pretty dynamic in recent years. 
Second, the absence of a consolidated debtor data base hinders any household credit risk 
assessment for supervisors and suppliers – a concern we brought up before this Senate last 
time  we  presented  our  Financial  Stability  Report.  Finally,  those  banks  that  have  recently 
expanded  a  lot  their  consumer  loan  portfolios  have  seen  a  sharper  deterioration  of  their 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 5 
NPLs  indicators,  consistent  with  greater  risk  taking  in  this  segment.  So  far,  this  has  been 
accompanied by increased provisions. 
While  in  recent  years  the  overall  Chilean  banking  system  has  tended  to  reduce  its 
dependence on short-term wholesale funding, some small and midsize banks remain highly 
dependent  on  this  source.  Although  wholesale  funding  plays  an  important  role  in  market 
discipline, it is particularly sensitive to changes in perceptions about the risk of issuers and to 
the assets’ liquidity in the secondary market. In addition, the events of recent years show that 
negative developments in foreign or local financial conglomerates may adversely affect the 
cost of funds in the wholesale market for the banks belonging to these groups.  
Accordingly,  it  is  important  that  banks  maintain  a  diversified  funding  base  in  terms  of 
counterparties  and  maturities.  Also,  banks  should  use  in  their  liquidity  management  stress 
tests  and  contingency  plans  that  appropriately  reflect  their  risks,  business  strategies, 
financial condition and financing ability under different scenarios. In addition, it is important 
that  banks  properly  internalize  the  economic  and  reputational  risks  of  their  exposure  to 
related entities, for which a proper corporate governance framework is crucial. 
In  this  context,  I  would  like  to  bring  to  your  attention  four  regulatory  elements.  First,  the 
Superintendence  of  Banks  and  Financial  Institutions  (SBIF)  perfected  its  regulatory 
framework  on  corporate  governance  in  banks.  Second,  based  on  the  possible  contagion 
effects in financial conglomerates the SBIF enhanced the regulations restricting transactions 
with  related  debtors,  increasing  their  supervision  tools  in  this  area.  Third,  in  relation  to 
funding  structures, the Central  Bank  is  reviewing the  liquidity  rules governing  the  banks  in 
order to strengthen management policies in this field, include binding regulatory limits on a 
consolidated  basis,  standardize  the  assumptions  of  our  own  models,  expand  information 
disclosure to the market about the liquidity position of each bank and move towards the new 
Basel  liquidity  standards.  Finally,  the  bill  of  law  sent  to  the  National  Congress  to 
institutionalize  the  Financial  Stability  Board  (FSB)  is  an  important  step,  because  it  grants 
capabilities that provide more space to the authorities to monitor the risks facing the financial 
system and coordinate responses to them. 
To  sum  up,  the  Chilean  economy  is  well  positioned  to  address  the  changing  internal  and 
external conditions that we are already seeing. The adjustments observed in relative prices, 
the  real  exchange  rate  and  interest  rates  have  gone  in  the  right  direction  to  facilitate  the 
adjustment  of  the  economy.  The  Board  follows  closely  the  evolution  of  the  external  and 
domestic  macroeconomic  scenarios  and  their  implications  on  inflation,  and  reiterates  its 
commitment to conduct monetary policy in such a way that projected inflation stands at 3% in 
the policy horizon. At the same time, it will continue to improve financial legislation in order to 
maintain and enhance this resilience, in those issues that are legally mandated. 
Let me end with some final thoughts. 
Final thoughts 
As is customary in our presentations to the Senate, we have tried to present as clearly and 
transparently  as  possible  our  assessment  of  the  current  economic  situation  and  its 
implications for managing the policy tools entrusted to us. Always keeping a watchful eye on 
the compliance of the mandates we have been given. 
The Chilean economy is on a good stand to face the challenges ahead, which certainly does 
not mean that we feel immune to whatever happens beyond our borders. We have managed 
economic policies seriously and responsibly in good times, which should allow us to move 
with relative ease through a not so favorable period.  
The country’s domestic and external position is strong, our financial system has limited risks, 
and  the  monetary  policy  is  in  a  position  that,  if necessary,  can  deal  with  a  different,  more 
complicated phase. In addition, a strong fiscal position with public debt that in net terms is 
virtually nil, something that not many countries can show.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
In the last two months we cut 50 basis points off the MPR, to 4.5 percent. The scenario that 
today  we  see  as  the  most  likely  does  not  envisages  the  need  for  significant  additional 
adjustments to the policy rate. However, in a different scenario where further adjustments are 
called  for,  there  is  the  room  and  the  will  to  carry  them  out. We,  as  the  Central  Bank,  will 
continue  to  contribute  with  our  assigned  duty,  that  is,  to  safeguard  the  stability  of  our 
currency and the normal functioning of the internal and external payment system, to Chile’s 
development and welfare. 
Many thanks,
