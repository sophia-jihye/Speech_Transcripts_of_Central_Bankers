Introduction 
Mr. President of the Finance Commission of the Senate, Senator Ricardo Lagos, senators 
members of this Commission, ladies, gentlemen. 
Thank you for inviting me to present Central Bank of Chile’s financial and macroeconomic 
outlook  and  its  view  on  the  most  recent  developments  and  their  implications  for  monetary 
and financial policy. This vision is contained in detail in our December 2014 Monetary Policy 
Report (IPoM) and our Financial Stability Report (IEF) of the second half of 2014. 
In recent months, our macroeconomic outlook has reflected unexpectedly high inflation and a 
slowdown in economic growth. In the projection scenario that I will be presenting shortly, we 
have revised upward our inflation forecast for the coming months, although we continue to 
estimate that it will converge to 3 percent during 2015. We have also revised downward our 
growth forecast for domestic output and demand this and next year. 
There are several factors underlying these corrections. The inflation surprises of the past few 
months originated in specific prices and were mostly temporary. Still, the high level of annual 
inflation today is largely due to the significant depreciation of our currency in recent quarters. 
On  the  output  side,  third-quarter  figures  showed  GDP  and  domestic  demand  growing  less 
than  forecasted.  In  addition,  fourth-quarter  figures  at  hand  show  no  signs  of  significant 
recovery. Thus, we foresee that achieving higher output growth rates will take longer than we 
thought last September. 
On aggregate, the international scenario has changed little since our last IPoM. Perhaps the 
most  significant  development  has  been  the  sharp  fall  in  the  oil  price  in  the  past  months, 
whose effects have begun to show in prices and will intensify in the near future. Meanwhile, 
although  risk  perceptions  have  increased  and  we  had  an  important  volatility  episode  in 
October  –  which  vanished  soon  –  no  significant  changes  are  observed  in  terms  of  global 
growth. 
At home, we completed a process of reducing the monetary policy interest rate (MPR), that 
took it from 5 to 3 percent between October 2013 and October 2014. This sharp reduction 
led  the  MPR  to  quite  expansionary  territory,  in  line  with  the  economic  slowdown  already 
mentioned. Funding costs in the domestic market have declined significantly, with mortgage 
loan rates nearing their all-time lows. 
Notwithstanding,  business  and  household  expectations  have  deteriorated  throughout  the 
year and are now clearly pessimistic, influencing downward this year’s growth and slowing 
further the recovery foreseen for 2015. At any rate, our projections for next year assume that 
these expectations will recover and provide support, together with many other factors, to a 
rebound in economic growth. 
Let me now share with you our baseline scenario and the main risks we have identified in the 
reports we present today.

  Macroeconomic scenario 
Inflation  brought  surprises  all  throughout  2014  by  being  unexpectedly  high.  Earlier  in  the 
year, the Board assumed that inflation would be at 3 percent at year’s end, partly because 
the accumulated depreciation would have a limited effect on inflation, in line with historical 
patterns.  Such  evaluation  was  modified  as  actual  data  showed  higher  than  expected 
transmission  to  final  prices.  So,  as  soon  as  June  the  inflation  forecast  was  revised 
significantly upward. In recent months, such transmission has been in line with expectations. 
However, the sharper depreciation of the peso and some specific elements – in particular, 
the rising price of some fresh fruits and vegetables – pushed inflation up above projections. 
These increases reversed somewhat in November, helped by the drop in fuel prices, which 
should continue to play a part in lowering inflation over the coming months. Private inflation 
expectations  also  posted  significant  changes  during  the  year,  consistently  with  the 
aforementioned surprises (figure 1). 
Regarding  output,  in  the  third  quarter  both  domestic  demand  and  GDP  grew  less  than 
forecasted in September, although the surprise was milder than it had been in the second 
quarter.  As  for  the  components  of  expenditure,  private  consumption  growth  was  low  and 
investment continued to fall in annual terms. The sharp decline in durables consumption and 
in  investment  in  machinery  and  equipment  stood  out  once  more  (figure  2).  The  drastic 
adjustment of expenditure and the depreciated peso have resulted in a fast reduction of the 
current- account deficit, whether measured at either trend prices or actual prices (figure 3). 
As  I  said,  the  sluggish  economic  figures  of  the  third  quarter  are  compounded  with  partial 
fourth-quarter indicators that show no significant recovery in spending. The annual change in 
imports  of  consumer  and  capital  goods  remains  negative;  various  indicators  of  retail  sales 
show  similar  trends  to  those  of  previous  months;  and  construction-related  data  shows 
persistent  weakness  (figure  4).  A  similar  picture  is  seen  in  manufacturing  which,  with  the 
main  exception  export  sectors,  reveals  a  steady  decline  in  activity.  The  scenario  for 
investment in construction and works, one of the most inertial components of expenditure, 
has also deteriorated. The September survey of the Capital Goods Corporation (CBC) further 
revised the amounts foreseen for 2014 and 2015, taking them below 2013 figures. 
This  economic  slowdown  has  occurred  in  a  context  where  business  and  household 
expectations have turned more pessimistic (figure 5). For consumers, this worsening occurs 
in  a  scenario  where  higher  inflation  has  eroded  households’  purchasing  power.  The 
unemployment rate is still near 6.5 percent, low from a historic perspective, but the creation 
of salaried jobs has remained slow and surveys reveal increased uncertainty about the future 
behavior of the labor market. For companies, the greater pessimism has coincided with low 
profitability  levels  and  investment  conditions  they  see  less  attractive.  Along  with  this, 
inventories are still judged as excessive despite repeated reductions in the past few quarters. 
As  mentioned  earlier,  domestic  credit  cost  has  become  more  favorable,  in  line  with  the 
substantial reduction of the monetary policy rate that took place in the past year (figure 6). 
Long-term  interest  rates  also  declined  significantly  during  the  last  year  and  a  half,  mainly 
responding to monetary policy actions (figure 7). Still, real annual growth in consumer and 
commercial lending is low, in some cases in its minimums of several years. The exception is 
mortgage credit, which is still growing strongly. The September Bank Lending Survey reveals 
a tightening of supply, but more importantly a drop in demand. 
The baseline scenario sees output growing 1.7 percent this year, marginally below the range 
foreseen  in September.  This  reflects  the  aforementioned  weakness  of  economic activity  in 
the third quarter and its extension into the last quarter of the year. It also reflects that, so far, 
consumer  and  entrepreneurial  expectations  have  failed  to  post  the  improvement  that  was 
expected some months ago. For 2015, the Board estimates that GDP growth will be in the 
2.5 to 3.5 percent range, so the economy is expected to continue growing below its medium-
term rate, which the Board estimates to lie between 4 and 4.5 percent.

  the  baseline  scenario,  external 
financial  conditions  and  prospects  will  be 
The economy is expected to outperform 2014 next year, thanks to the rapid and significant 
adjustments it made this year, as is visible in the current account, interest rates, and the real 
exchange  rate.  It  also  relies  on  the  expected  improvement  in  consumer  and  business 
confidence, as well as in the external conditions foreseen for 2015, which although not so 
good as expected in September, are an improvement from 2014, partly owing to the boost 
coming  from  the  oil  price  decline.  The  significant  monetary  impulse  that  has  been  added 
already,  the  stronger  fiscal  impulse  and  the  effect  of  the  peso  depreciation  on  the  tradable 
sectors will provide important support. Finally, although the financial situation of households and 
enterprises has tightened, it is not expected to be a hindrance to economic recovery (table 1). 
On the external front, the baseline scenario considers a less dynamic outlook than forecast in 
September,  but  still  pointing  at  greater  growth  rates  in  2015  and  2016  than  in  2014.  This 
outlook reflects world activity that has recently receded, but that is compensated, at least in 
part, by the boost coming from the oil price drop. By regions, it is worth noting the widening 
divergence  between  the  United  States  –  with  a  more  consolidated  recovery  –  and  other 
developed  economies,  such  as  the  Eurozone  and  Japan,  which  have  made  further 
downward revisions. In the emerging world, prospects are also weaker, with Latin America 
making the bigger downward corrections. In the baseline scenario, our trading partners are 
expected to grow 3.5 and 3.9 percent in 2015 and 2016, respectively (table 2). 
In 
less 
expansionary than they were this year, but will remain favorable from a historical perspective. 
In the United States, the Federal Reserve Board ended its asset purchase program and is 
expected to raise the federal funds rate in 2015, probably pushing US long-term rates up. 
The Eurozone and Japan have pursued a more expansionary monetary policy, because of 
weaker economies and deflationary risks, and further efforts in this direction are expected in 
the  coming  quarters.  Thus,  long-term  interest  rates  in  the  main  developed  economies 
continued to recede or remained low. The better relative performance of the United States 
compared with the rest of the world has led to an overall strengthening of the dollar, affecting 
the  other  currencies,  including  the  Chilean  peso.  In  Chile,  its  trajectory  has  also  been 
influenced  by  the  adjustment  of  the  local  macroeconomic  scenario,  changes  in  monetary 
policy and the decline in copper prices (figure 8). 
The drop in commodity prices has triggered important changes in the world inflation outlook. 
In particular, the actual and expected oil price dropped significantly, mainly due to supply-
side factors that have generated a surplus balance in the oil market. It has also translated 
into a reduction in the relevant external inflation forecast, and has improved Chile’s terms of 
trade. However, part of this is offset by the lower copper price – actual and foreseen – which 
traded at less than 3 USD per pound in the weeks prior to the statistical cutoff of this IPoM 
Report. The baseline scenario assumes that the copper price will average 295 and 285 cents 
per pound in 2015 and 2016, respectively. 
Chile’s  annual  headline  inflation  is  expected  to  remain  above  4  percent  for  some  more 
months. Still, the mix of high comparison basis in 2014, the evolution of fuel prices and the 
accumulation of capacity gaps in the economy will pull it down towards 3 per cent over the 
course of 2015. Then it should hover around 3 percent until the last quarter of 2016, i.e., the 
end  of  the  projection  horizon  (figure  9).  The  CPI  that  excludes  food  and  energy  CPIEFE 
forecast for 2015 is corrected upward, taking into account the sharper depreciation of the peso, 
its transmission to prices and the evolution of nominal wages. At any rate, it is expected to end 
next year around 3 percent and fluctuate close to that value throughout 2016. 
This  trajectory  assumes  that  the  peso  depreciation  of  recent  months  will  pass  through  to 
prices  as  it  has  done  historically;  that  wages  will  be  adjusted  in  line  with  productivity 
changes; and that capacity gaps will remain stable over the projection horizon. About the real 
exchange  rate,  we  use  as  a  methodological  assumption  that  it  will  stay  near  its  current 
values,  considering  that  it  is  within  the  range  believed  to  be  consistent  with  its  long-term 
fundamentals. We also use, as a working assumption, that the monetary policy rate will not 
change in the short run.

  The baseline scenario reflects those events believed to be the most likely to occur with the 
information  at  hand  at  the  closing  of  this  Report.  There  are  risks,  however,  that,  if 
materialized, could reshape the macroeconomic scenario and thus may alter the course of 
monetary policy. 
Abroad, there is the risk of when and at what speed the Fed will start raising its benchmark 
rate,  and  how  this  will  affect  financial  assets.  The  risk  of  greater  market  volatility  has 
increased because of the growing discrepancies between private expectations and the Fed’s 
announcements, plus the divergence of monetary policies of the main developed economies. 
In  China,  the  risks  about  its  performance  have  gained  importance,  reflecting  its  recent 
weakening.  The  evolution  of  the  Chinese  financial  system  and  real-estate  sector  are  the 
main  focus  of  attention,  as  they  could  result  in  a  sharper  drop  in  the  copper  price.  In  the 
Eurozone, despite progress in the financial and banking industries – as revealed by stress 
tests – credit growth is still slow and a sharper deceleration is a latent risk. 
All  these  risks  in  the  external  scenario  could  trigger  new  episodes  of  volatility  in  world 
financial markets, with important negative effects in credit costs and output. They could also 
result in an additional depreciation of emerging currencies – our peso included – affecting the 
short-term inflation outlook. 
On the bright side, it is possible for the oil price to have a stronger than forecast effect on 
both  external  and  internal  activity,  either  because  the  effect  of  a  reduction  is  greater  than 
assumed in the baseline scenario, or because the drop is steeper. 
Locally,  one  risk  has  to  do  with  output,  but  especially  with  domestic  demand  dynamics. 
Prospects  for  recovery  have  been  postponed  time  and  again,  while  the  possibility  of  true 
recovery  has  lost  strength.  The  baseline  scenario  assumes  that  business  and  consumer 
confidence will improve gradually. If not, the slowdown in spending and output may become 
persistent and translate into longer-lasting capacity gaps and reduced inflationary pressures. 
It cannot be ruled out that the current size of gaps – an unobservable variable with quite an 
uncertain measurement – turns out to be smaller than estimated and thus contributes less 
than expected to slowing down inflation. Low unemployment and strong growth in nominal 
wages put a note of caution in the evaluation of inflation dynamics. 
After  assessing  these  risks,  which  originate  both  domestically  and  abroad,  the  Board 
estimates that the risk balance is unbiased for inflation and downward biased for output. 
Inflation  is  high  now,  but  it  is  expected  to  approach  3  percent  over  the  course  of  2015. 
Domestic output and demand continue to show significant weakness and growth prospects 
for 2015 have been revised downwards, despite that both monetary and fiscal impulses are 
significant, and the external impulse will be slightly larger than what we saw this year. The 
Board led the policy rate to 3 percent and stated that future changes to it would depend on 
the  evolution  of  internal  and  external  macroeconomic  conditions,  and  their  implications  on 
the  inflation  outlook.  At  the  same  time,  it  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to  conduct  monetary 
policy with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3 percent over the policy horizon. 
The Financial Stability Report (IEF) 
Our Financial Stability Report (IEF) discloses, twice a year (in June and December), those 
recent macroeconomic and financial developments that might influence the financial stability 
of the Chilean economy. Let me now briefly describe some of the main subjects covered in 
this last issue. 
The same scenarios for external risk I just described are analyzed in the IEF. 
From the standpoint of financial stability, we conclude that as the process of monetary policy 
normalization  in  the  United  States  advances,  financial  volatility  episodes  may  follow.  The 
expansionary policies have helped  to shape the current environment  of low risk premiums 
and low volatility. Thus, any surprises in the evolution of the US monetary policy could affect 
4

  financial conditions – like they did in May of 2013 –, raising credit costs in world markets, 
reversing portfolio flows and depreciating emerging-country currencies against the US dollar. 
The beginning of a new cycle of quantitative expansion by the European Central Bank, plus 
similar  announcements  by  the  Bank  of  Japan,  might  reduce  the  likelihood  and  impact  of 
these volatility episodes, depending on how these unconventional policies ultimately reflect in 
global lending conditions. 
A  different  risk  has  to  do  with  the  slowdown  of  emerging  economies  resulting  in  reduced 
capital  flows.  This  because  their  assets  become  less  attractive,  all  the  more  so  in  Latin 
America. A scenario in which the recent drop in commodity prices is prolonged or intensified, 
or where doubts about China’s performance resurge strongly, might trigger this kind of event. 
The scene may become more complex if at the same time long-term rates go up in the US, 
increasing the cost of external funding. 
It  should  also  be  considered  that  an  increase  in  the  cost  of  external  financing  could  put 
upward  pressure on local long-term  interest  rates. The  decline in external and domestic 
long-term interest rates has motivated bond issues in both markets and local demand for 
type-3  mutual  funds.  While  local  rates  have  not  responded  only  to  changes  in  external 
rates – reflecting also the actions of local monetary policy –, a rise in international interest 
rates  could  result  in  increased  costs  of  corporate  financing.  At  the  same  time,  it  could 
generate portfolio adjustments by the agents involved, helping in the interest rate hike and 
causing greater volatility in the markets. 
As of the second quarter, Chile’s corporate financial sector showed no material change from 
end-of-2013, although debt is high and profits are low by historical standards (figure 10). All 
in  all,  the  debt-to-GDP  ratio  maintains  a  slightly  positive  trend.  In  the  context  of  slower 
economic  growth,  we  cannot  rule  out  less  favorable  indicators  coming  in  for  more  recent 
periods  –  not  available  at  the  closing  of  this  IEF  Report.  Meanwhile,  the  exchange  rate 
depreciation has not eroded significantly the profits of currency-mismatched firms. 
In the residential real-estate market, prices continue on the rise, while in the office- space 
sector  vacancies  have  increased  (figure  11).  Market  indicators  point  to  strong  growth  in 
housing prices in the Metropolitan Region, as demand continues to be strong – despite the 
ongoing phase of the business cycle – and depleted inventories. A change in these factors 
could  result  in  slower  growth  in  prices,  so  one  must  not  extrapolate  past  trends  into 
investment and funding decisions for projects in the sector. On the commercial side, and in 
line with previous IEFs, the entry of new projects into the office-space market has increased 
the vacancy rate, which could grow further if the supply continues to rise. 
Household indebtedness is higher – mainly on the mortgage side –, although the financial 
burden  is  stable  thanks  to  lower  interest  rates  (figure  12).  The  low  level  of  unemployment 
and the banking system’s orientation to households that are less exposed to the business 
cycle, as mentioned in previous Reports, has resulted in stable bank repayment indicators, 
despite the weakness of recent quarters. Overall, we must keep in mind that the labor market 
could deteriorate, and with it the repayment capacity of the debtors. 
Regarding credit, in the commercial portfolio, the drop in both interest rates and credit flows 
suggests  that  demand-side  factors  are  dominating.  Part  of  the  lower  demand  for  bank 
financing  is  due  to  debt  being  replaced  by  bond  issues.  The  September  Bank  Lending 
Survey  shows  that  both  supply  and  demand  factors  tightened  with  respect  to  previous 
periods,  but  demand  contracted  more.  There  is  mixed  evidence  for  consumer  lending, 
validating factors of supply and demand. It is worth noting that the information at hand shows 
no  clear  evidence  that  the  new  regulations  for  the  maximum  conventional  rate  (TMC)  has 
affected banks’ consumer credit flows. This, considering that few bank credit operations are 
performed at rates higher than 41 and 39 percent, the actual TMC levels for the third quarter in 
operations between UF 0 and UF50, and between UF 50 and UF 200, respectively. Still, such 
provisions regarding the TMC are still in the process of being implemented, so future reductions 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

  are  expected,  which  might  have  a  greater  impact  because  of  the  significant  number  of 
operations that are performed with interest rates in the 35 to 40 percent range (figure 13). 
Bank financial indicators are sound and stress tests show that capital levels are adequate to 
confront a severe stress episode (figure 14). Although bank profitability has increased lately, 
this  was  boosted  by  the  temporary  effect  of  higher  inflation.  The  interest  rate  spread  has 
been  stable  over  2014  and  continues  to  be  the  main  contributor  to  the  banking  system’s 
profits. The impact of the stress scenario involves a drop in profits similar to the one in the 
previous IEF, but as the initial profitability was better the banks can obtain a positive closing 
ROE in this scenario. 
Bond  issues,  locally  and  abroad,  have  helped  to  diversify  the  banks’  funding  sources 
(figure 15). Lower funding costs have favored debt issues locally and abroad, increasing the 
duration  of  liabilities.  Some  banks  operate  with  high  dependence  on  wholesale  sources, 
which can be a significant vulnerability if these investors change their portfolio decisions or 
flows become more volatile. 
To sum up, the present financial situation of enterprises and households, while still strong, is 
less comfortable than it was some years back, so it is not as strong to deal with a worsening 
of the domestic or international macroeconomic environment. Thus, it is important for agents 
to thoroughly assess their borrowing and lending decisions going forward. 
I would like to finish with some thoughts. 
Final thoughts 
2014 has not been a good year for our economy: growth  has been slow and inflation has 
surpassed  our  tolerance  range  for  several  months.  The  analysis  I  have  shared  with  you 
today shows that to a great extent these numbers result from the natural adjustment of an 
economy experiencing major changes in both local and external conditions. These changes 
require big adjustments in relative prices to reallocate resources across sectors. 
We  mustn’t  forget  that  the  external  scenario  has  been  greatly  modified  in  the  past  few 
quarters. We saw the end of the so-called commodity super-cycle. Its negative impact on the 
copper price has affected mining investment, one of our economy’s main sources of growth 
in recent times. China’s economic situation has been weaker than forecast, as has been the 
situation  of  several  other  emerging  economies.  This  has  increased  the  volatility  of  the 
external financial conditions facing emerging economies, a phenomenon that has intensified 
as the normalization of US monetary policy approaches. 
We have been often asked whether the discussion on the reforms now being studied in the 
country has played a role in our economic slowdown. Our answers have been clear. First of 
all,  we  appreciate  the  discussion  aimed  at  perfecting  areas  that  may  help  to  improve  our 
fellow Chileans’ standards of living and further develop our economy. However, the Central 
Bank will not take part in the particulars of each of the reforms, because they lie beyond its 
scope of action. Secondly, we value the fact that if some reforms entail permanent increases 
in public spending, their funding comes from increased permanent income, so as to preserve 
the  fiscal  soundness  our  economy  has  displayed  for  decades.  Third,  it  is  logical  –  and 
recognized  as  such  across  the  board  –  that  reforms  of  this  magnitude  generate  some 
uncertainties and worries, pushing back investment projects and affecting economic activity. 
But this effect is difficult to quantify. Lastly, in our pursuit of institutional stability, we think it is 
positive that the deepest agreements possible be reached around the major reforms being 
now debated in the country. From this perspective we appreciate the spirit of the agreement 
led by the Finance Minister and this Parliament for the approval of the tax reform. 
Also,  I  would  like  to  explain  the  role  played  by  the  Central  Bank  in  the  context  of  the 
economic slowdown we are experiencing. The function of monetary policy is not to prevent 
the  economy  from  adjusting,  but  rather  to  help  the  adjustment  to  be  smooth  and  not 
jeopardize the convergence of inflation. This is what we have done since mid-2013, when the 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
  Board announced that in great probability a monetary easing was coming, which immediately 
translated into a reduction in long-term interest rates. Later on, in October 2013, we began 
the  monetary  expansion  process  that  involved  a  reduction  of  200  basis  points  off  the 
monetary policy rate in one year. In these months we have acted with conviction, allowing an 
easing  of  financial  conditions  and  a  peso  depreciation  that  we  believe  important  for  the 
economy’s cyclical adjustment. Thus, during 2014 our economy was the one that lowered its 
policy rate the most among a group of emerging countries, with the obvious result that our 
currency has also depreciated the most (table 3). 
This  has  not  been  cost-free.  The  depreciation  of  our  peso  has  certainly  been  the  biggest 
source of the high inflation rate of this year, but it is a cost that any healthy economy like ours 
can assume in these circumstances, provided that the situation is transitory, as we believe it 
is.  This  sets  us  apart  from  other  emerging  economies,  which  because  of  vulnerabilities 
accumulated in the past, now have difficulties to take more resolute action in this matter. 
Today our economy is ready to resume a higher growth path. This assertion is based on the 
fast and significant adjustment it made during the year, as reflected in the current account, 
interest rates and the real exchange rate. Also in the fact that external conditions forecast to 
2015, while less auspicious than expected in September, point to an improvement from this 
year. And last but not least, in the strength of our economy and our institutions. 
The significant monetary impulse that has already been added, the increased fiscal impulse 
and  the  effect  of  the  peso  depreciation  on  the  performance  of  tradable  sectors  will  lend 
support  to  economic  activity.  The  depreciation  of  our  currency  has  favored  the  exporting 
sectors and the regions where some of these sectors are based. It is worth noting that, as 
can  be  inferred  from  our  Business  Perceptions  Report,  certain  regions  of  our  country, 
especially  to  the  south,  which  have  endured  difficult  moments  in  the  past  few  years,  now 
largely outperform their peers up north. 
However, as I already mentioned, inflation remains high and above projections, a sign that 
for the time being monetary policy actions have reached its limit. Although we are convinced 
that inflation will return to near 3 percent over the course of 2015, we cannot rule out that this 
convergence  is  slower  than  expected.  This  is  important,  because  in  the  end,  we  must  not 
forget that higher inflation hits hardest those most vulnerable sectors of the population, as 
they have fewer tools to deal with it. 
In this sense, absent significant changes in the scenario we estimate to be the most likely, 
we  do  not  see  that,  in  the  short  run,  we  should  increase  the  monetary  impulse,  which  is 
already  strong  enough.  Of  course,  if  the  baseline  scenario  changes,  we  will  need  to 
reconsider. 
Our baseline scenario assumes that the economy will return to higher growth rates in 2015. 
However, it is our concern and we see as a significant risk that the recovery of output and 
expenditure  has  been  postponed  and  weakened  in  the  past  few  quarters.  As  I  said,  third-
quarter indicators were weaker than expected, and partial fourth-quarter numbers have failed 
to  display  a  significant  change  in  these  trends.  In  addition,  consumer  and  business 
confidence  has  deteriorated  further.  The  outlook  I  am  presenting  today,  as  well  as  that  in 
September, assume that said confidence will be regained. 
Ensuring better internal conditions is especially important in a context where the state of the 
world economy seems less robust than just a few months ago, and where the risks facing 
emerging economies have increased. 
Monetary  policy  has  already  added  a  very  strong  impulse,  the  peso  depreciation  is 
contributing  and  will  continue  to  do  so,  and  Congress  has  approved  a  Fiscal  Budget  that 
considers a significant increase in public investment. 
We,  as  the  Central  Bank,  reiterate  that  we  will  conduct  monetary  policy  to  ensure  that 
inflation stands at 3 percent over the policy horizon, and we insist that every participant in the 
financial system needs to thoroughly evaluate their borrowing and lending decisions. At the

  same time, we will continue to contribute to Chile’s development and welfare with what is our
