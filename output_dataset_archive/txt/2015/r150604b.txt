policy – overview of the two-year period after adopting QQE

 Introduction 
I.  
Good  morning.  I  feel  honored  to  have  an  opportunity  to  meet  with  the  local  business 
representatives  here  today.  Let  me  also  express  my  sincere  gratitude  for  your  kind 
cooperation with the activities of the Bank of Japan’s Nagoya Branch. More than two years 
have  passed  since  adopting  quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary  easing  (QQE)  policy  in 
April 2013. So I would like first to review Japan’s economic and price performance over the 
two  years  and  present  my  own  assessment  on  the  effectiveness  of  QQE.  After  that,  I  will 
touch  on  the  Bank’s  outlook  for  economic  activity  and  prices  for  fiscal  2015  through  fiscal 
2017, as described in the April 2015 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (hereafter, the 
Outlook Report). 
II.   Economic and price performance after adopting QQE 
Let  me  now  proceed  with  the  actual  performance  of  economic  activity  during the  past two 
years, followed by that of prices. 
Economic performance in fiscal 2013 and 2014 
A.  
Let us first look at the performance of real GDP. Chart 1 indicates the amounts as well as the 
year-on-year rates of change in real GDP for fiscal 2013 and 2014 together with those for 
fiscal  2012  (a  year  before  the  introduction  of  QQE)  as  a  reference.  After  having  risen  by 
about 5.1 trillion yen in fiscal 2012, the amount of increase in real GDP almost doubled to 
around 11 trillion in fiscal 2013, but it subsequently dropped by about 5.6 trillion yen in fiscal 
2014. The net increase in real GDP over the period of fiscal 2013–14 was around 5.2 trillion 
yen  –  roughly  the  same  amount  of  increase  as  in  fiscal  2012.  The  year-on-year  rate  of 
change in real GDP doubled from about 1 percent in fiscal 2012 to about 2 percent in fiscal 
2013, but it then recorded somewhat large negative growth of minus 1 percent in fiscal 2014. 
Positive growth for two consecutive years without the tax hike effects 
The consumption tax hike in April 2014 from 5 percent to 8 percent exerted large adverse 
impacts on Japan’s economy. So, in assessing the effectiveness of QQE, it is important to 
look at the economic performance by excluding the estimated impacts of the tax hike. Chart 
1 shows the estimated amounts and the rates of change in real GDP excluding the tax hike 
impacts;  those  impacts  are  estimated  by  the  Bank  to  be  an  increase  of  around 
0.5 percentage point for fiscal 2013 and a decrease of around 1.2 percentage points for fiscal 
2014. 
Please note that the purpose of this estimation is simply to try to examine the effectiveness 
of monetary easing: judgment about the tax hike is decided purely by the government. For its 
estimates, the Bank took into account the impacts of the tax increase on household spending 
(private consumption and housing investment), business fixed investment, and other factors. 
The  impact  on  business  fixed  investment  was  considered  because  some  entities,  such  as 
firms eligible for the simplified tax system and tax exemption, appear to have front-loaded an 
increase in business fixed investment prior to the tax hike. In fiscal 2013, upward pressure on 
real  GDP  was  propelled  by  front-loaded  increases  in  private  consumption,  housing

  investment,  and  business  fixed  investment  –  as  against  downward  pressure  on  real  GDP 
created by a decline in inventory investment and a rise in imports. The net impact of the tax 
hike was positive (an increase of 0.5 percentage point). By contrast, the net impact for fiscal 
2014 turned negative (a decline of 1.2 percentage points); this was because all the forces 
that emerged in fiscal 2013 now worked in the opposite direction and also because additional 
adverse impacts on private consumption and housing investment appeared as a result of a 
decline  in  real  (disposable)  income.  I  would  note  that  these  estimates  are  subject  to  a 
considerable margin of error because it is difficult to quantify the exact effects of the tax hike. 
Chart  1  indicates  that  real  GDP,  after  excluding  the  effects  of  the  tax  hike,  increased  by 
8.1 trillion yen in fiscal 2013 – a decline of 2.7 trillion yen, which represents the net positive 
impact  of  the  front-loaded  increase  in  expenditure.  Yet  the  rate  of  real  GDP  growth 
maintained  a  fairly  high  positive  rate  of  around  1.6  percent.  The  noticeable  change  is 
observed in fiscal 2014, when real GDP growth turned to a positive increase of 0.8 trillion yen 
rather than a decrease of 5.6 trillion yen. This means that a positive growth rate of around 
0.2 percent would have been achieved in fiscal 2014 if there had been no consumption tax 
hike, which had an estimated net negative impact of around 6.4 trillion yen. 
My Views regarding the effectiveness of QQE on economic activity 
Real  GDP  growth  rates  during  the  two  years  after  the  introduction  of  QQE  were  around 
1.6 percent in fiscal 2013 (excluding the effects of the tax hike), which significantly exceeded 
the  potential  growth  rate  (the  Bank’s  estimate  of  about  0.5  percent  or  lower),  and  around 
0.2 percent  in  fiscal  2014,  which  was  roughly  equivalent  to  the  potential  growth  rate.  This 
positive performance reflects both the fiscal stimulus measures and the impact of monetary 
easing. Let me briefly summarize the transmission mechanism of QQE on economic growth. 
The  Bank  estimates  that  large-scale  asset  purchases  under  QQE  succeeded  in  lowering 
long-term  real  interest  rates  by  around  0.7  to  0.9  percentage  point  –  or  slightly  less  than 
1 percentage point – cumulatively over the past two years. This decline in real interest rates 
encouraged  private  consumption  and  business  fixed  investment,  and  was  also  associated 
with a depreciation of the yen and a stock price rise – resulting in favorable corporate profits 
and an increase in nominal compensation of employees. 
Given the expected effect of the unusually large-scale monetary easing, some of you may 
consider that, excluding the impacts of the tax hike, real GDP should have expanded more 
impressively over the past two years. In this regard, I view that a further expansion of private 
consumption was constrained to some extent by the following: (1) dissolution of the special 
level of pension benefits from the second half of fiscal 2013; (2) a cut in real pension benefits 
and a decline in real wages (both owing to moderate inflation excluding the direct impact of 
the tax hike); and (3) the severe weather around the summer of 2014. As for business fixed 
investment,  the  increase  was  less  than  initially  expected  owing  to  cautious  investment 
behavior of firms, mainly domestic demand-oriented firms, due in part to sluggish domestic 
sales.  Exports  has  picked  up  from  the  second  half  of  fiscal  2014,  mainly  to  the  United 
States. However, they did not increase as much as initially projected owing in part to a shift 
of production sites overseas, a decline in international competitiveness in some industries, 
sluggish recovery in overseas economies, and the J-curve effect. In addition, the effects of 
expanding  domestic  demand  induced  by  front-loaded  consumption  and  business  fixed 
investment were somewhat diminished since a  sustained rise in inflation expectations  was 
not  observed  (as  described  later).  These  factors  are  considered  to  have  partly  offset  the 
effectiveness of monetary easing and resulted in lower real GDP growth rates for fiscal 2013 
and 2014 than those initially forecasted by the Policy Board members (Chart 2-1). 
Over  the  period  of  fiscal  2013–14,  the  output  gap  improved  by  around  1.5  percentage 
points  in  fiscal  2013  –  from  around  minus  2.2  percent  in  fiscal  2012  to  minus  0.7  percent 
(Chart 1). It further improved by 0.5 percentage point to minus 0.2 percent in fiscal 2014. The 
net  2-percentage-point  improvement  in  the  output  gap  seems  remarkable  (Chart  3).  That 
said, the scale of improvement in fiscal 2014 was rather limited and largely underperformed 
2 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  the Bank’s initial forecast in April 2013. Although the sluggish improvement in the output gap 
in fiscal 2014 was mainly due to the greater-than-anticipated impact of the consumption tax 
hike,  the  other  aforementioned  demand-suppressing  factors  also  played  a  role  as 
“headwinds.”  Conversely,  it  may  be  concluded  that  the  output  gap  of  nearly  0  percent  in 
fiscal 2014 was actually not so bad given the sharp deterioration of the real GDP growth rate 
of  minus  1  percent.  Indeed,  my  evaluation  is  that  QQE  and  its  expansion  supported  the 
economy  and  prevented  actual  performance  from  deteriorating  further,  and  therefore  the 
effectiveness of QQE should not be denied. 
Here, I should point out that the 2-percentage-point improvement in the output gap was not 
attributable only to monetary and fiscal policies. It was also affected by a structural factor; for 
example,  of  an  increasing  sense  of  labor  shortage  caused  by  the  declining  trend  in  the 
working-age population, together with the recent retirement of the baby-boomer generation. 
In addition, a decline in the potential growth rate (caused by sluggish growth in total factor 
productivity and in capital stock) may have had an effect (Chart 3). 
In  sum,  despite  the  various  headwinds,  it  is  evident  that  QQE  pushed  up  real  GDP  by 
lowering real interest rates and contributed to improving the output gap to the 0-percent level 
from  negative  territory.  Business  and  household  sentiment  has  been  recovering  owing  to 
steady improvements in corporate profits and employment, and the economic recovery after 
the consumption tax hike has now become solid. 
In 
the  report,  economic  outcome  was 
On economic activity: The outlook report’s “Assessment of the Effects of QQE” 
Now,  let  me  provide  some  additional  explanation  from  my  perspective  about  the  Bank’s 
assessment  of  the  effects  of  QQE,  which  appeared  in  the  background  section  of  the 
Outlook  Report.1 
first  estimated  using  a 
macroeconometric model – based on a real interest rate channel – by exogenously plugging 
in  a  decline  of  minus  0.8  percent  to  long-term  real  interest  rates  (which  were  close  to  the 
estimated actual figure). Subsequently, this estimated value was compared with the actual 
value.  If  the  actual  value  exceeds  the  estimated  value,  this  implies  that  there  are  some 
positive effects other than the real interest rate channel. The result was mixed. Although the 
estimated value exceeded the actual value in terms of the real GDP growth rate, the actual 
value exceeded the estimated value in terms of the output gap. This can be interpreted as 
follows:  real  GDP  did  not  improve  as  much  as  its  estimated  value  owing  to  the 
aforementioned headwinds; however, the output gap exceeded its estimated value because 
of labor shortages as well as a decline in the potential growth rate. Taking into consideration 
the  various  headwinds,  I  believe  that  real  interest  rates  would  have  been  lower  if  the 
sustained  rise  in  inflation  expectations  had  been  realized.  This  would  have  exerted further 
upward pressure on the real GDP growth rate, thereby further improving the output gap. 
Price performance in fiscal 2013 and 2014 
B.  
Next, I will focus on price performance. Let us start with developments in the GDP deflator. 
The year-on-year rates of change in the GDP deflator increased from minus 0.9 percent in 
fiscal  2012  to  minus  0.3  percent  in  fiscal  2013.  Then,  a  positive  level  of  2.5  percent 
(1.1 percent excluding the direct impact of the consumption tax hike of around 1.4 percent) 
was reached in fiscal 2014 (Chart 1). 
Inflation rates turned positive: CPI in fiscal 2013 and GDP deflator in fiscal 2014 
In  particular,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  private 
consumption deflator finally turned positive in fiscal 2013 after having remained consistently 
negative since fiscal 1998. Also, the rate of change in the business fixed investment deflator

  turned positive in fiscal 2013 after having been on a declining trend since the early 1990s 
owing to quality adjustment as well as a decreasing trend in the prices of IT-related products. 
The  housing  investment  deflator  likewise  rose  in  fiscal  2013  reflecting  front-loaded 
construction activities, and it is still rising owing to labor shortages as well as the increased 
cost of construction materials. 
The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) 
shifted from minus 0.2 percent in fiscal 2012 to plus 0.8 percent in fiscal 2013 and then to 
2.8 percent (around 0.8 percent excluding the direct impact of the consumption tax hike) in 
fiscal  2014  (Chart  1).  GDP  deflator-based  inflation  turned  positive  one  year  after  the  CPI 
inflation,  mainly  due  to  a  deterioration  in  the  terms  of  trade  in  fiscal  2013.  An  increase  in 
import prices caused by high crude oil prices and the yen’s depreciation led to an increase in 
the CPI, but it depressed the GDP deflator because it worked as a subtraction item. 
Inflation expectations rose by 0.7 percentage point at most 
Inflation expectations (excluding the direct impact of the consumption tax hike) are assessed 
based on various indicators. Over the period of fiscal 2013 to 2014, medium- to long-term 
inflation  expectations  (usually  more  than  one  year)  of  economists  and  market  participants 
rose by around 0.3 to 0.7 percentage point; most of that increase was concentrated in fiscal 
2013  (Charts  4–1  and  4-2).  Meanwhile,  an  increase  in  inflation  expectations  reflected  in 
market-based indicators (such as the inflation swap rates) remained in the range of around 
0.0–0.5 percent over the same period. Expectations of households and firms do not seem to 
have  changed  much.  The  faster  change  in  such  expectations  of  economists  and  market 
participants may reflect that they tend to make forecasts based on macroeconomic data and 
are  thus  more  responsive  to  the  Bank’s  monetary  policy  actions.  It  should  be  noted  that 
market-based indicators also incorporate the liquidity risk of the relevant market. 
On prices: the Outlook report’s “Assessment of the Effects of QQE” and my views 
Overall, I consider that QQE has mitigated deflationary pressure, caused by the excessive 
appreciation of the yen and fierce discount-based competition in the distribution sector, and 
has provided an incentive for firms to explore potential demand by urging them to produce 
innovative goods and services and to set fair prices. The CPI-based inflation was positive for 
two consecutive years, but the inflation rate was just around 0.8 percent (excluding the direct 
impact of the consumption tax hike) in fiscal 2014. This rate was about the same as that in 
fiscal 2013 and much lower than had been initially projected in April 2013 (Chart 2-1). 
In this regard, I would like to provide my personal views on the “Assessment of the Effects 
of  QQE”  on  prices  described  in  the  aforementioned  Outlook  Report  as  an  additional 
explanation. In my view, the actual CPI rise of “plus 1 percentage point” over the past two 
years exceeded the estimated value from the macroeconometric model because the actual 
degree of improvement in the output gap was better than the estimated value. Nonetheless, 
the 2 percent target is yet to be achieved, mainly because of the rapid decline in crude oil 
prices,  but  another  important  factor  is  the  slow  pace  of  the  rise  in  medium-  to  long-term 
inflation expectations, which have remained at around plus 0.7 percentage point at most. 
Regarding  developments  in  medium-  to long-term  inflation  expectations,  a  number  of 
indicators  have  deteriorated  since  the  summer  of  2014.  This  deterioration  seems  to  have 
been affected by the decline in the CPI caused by weakness in domestic demand and the 
decline in crude oil prices. In October 2014, there were growing concerns that a continuous 
fall  in  inflation  expectations,  partly  driven  by  weak  demand,  could  undermine  positive 
developments  in  wage  negotiations  and  firms’  price-setting  behavior.  To  prevent  those 
concerns  from  materializing,  the  Bank  decided  to  expand  QQE.  This  preemptive,  prompt 
policy  action,  together  with  the  stability  in  crude  oil  prices,  helped  halt  the  fall  in  inflation 
expectations, and thereafter inflation expectations have become largely constant. Moreover, 
the  recovery  in  domestic  demand  became gradually  more  evident toward  the  end  of fiscal 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  2014, and the output gap is turning positive. For these reasons, I believe that the underlying 
trend in prices has been maintained. 
Having said that, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is currently about 0 percent, 
and the 2 percent target is still quite distant. The challenge for the Bank over the next few 
years is whether medium- to long-term inflation expectations will begin to rise steadily. The 
Outlook Report stipulates that a further rise in inflation expectations is necessary to achieve 
the  2  percent  target  in  a  stable  manner.  This  judgment  is  consistent  with  my  repeated 
remarks  over  recent  years.  I  personally  hold  the  view  that  inflation  expectations  of 
economists  and  market  participants  are  useful  in  evaluating  the  consistency  of  the  Bank’s 
outlook and its practicality, and they may also gradually affect the inflation expectations of 
households and firms. However, in ultimately assessing price stability, I consider that greater 
attention  should  be  paid  to  households’  price  perceptions  and  their  inflation  expectations 
together with firms’ price-setting behavior, as I will now explain. 
Understanding the movements of households’ and firms’ inflation expectations 
In terms of achieving the 2 percent price stability target, I believe that important consideration 
should be placed on households’ inflation expectations and related expenditure behavior. 
This may appear self-evident because the price stability target – adopted by the Bank and 
other major central banks – is the CPI, for which prices refer to the consumption basket of 
households. In other words, central banks attempt to stabilize the cost of households’ living 
expenses.  However,  the  use  of  households’  inflation  expectations  may  give  rise  to  an 
upward-bias problem – an issue that is often pointed out by other central banks. In Japan, 
households  always  tend  to  expect  that  prices  will  rise  even  during  a  phase  of  deflation 
(Chart 5).  The  upward  bias  appears  to  be  generated  because  households’  inflation 
expectations are heavily affected by price movements – for example, daily necessities and 
gasoline. 
Of  course,  it  is  also  important  to  consider  firms’  inflation  expectations  because  they 
ultimately set their own sales prices and wages. However, to maintain their profit margins, 
firms are unable to continue raising sales prices at the expense of suppressing demand for 
their goods and services. Therefore, I think that the most important determinant of the CPI is 
likely to be households’ perception of prices and their inflation expectations. In a speech I 
gave in Europe in March 2015, I discussed households’ and firms’ inflation expectations in 
detail. And I would now like to share with you some of those findings.2 Since the amount of 
data acquired is not yet sufficient with regard to firms’ inflation expectations, some caution is 
required in interpreting the results. 
1. 
Households’ inflation expectations tend to be higher than those of firms. One of the 
reasons  may  be  because  firms  and  households  envisage  different  prices  when 
responding  to  a  survey  questionnaire.  Households  are  asked  to  respond  about 
overall  prices  of  goods  and  services  they  purchase,  whereas  firms  are  asked  to 
respond  about  general  prices  measured  by  the  CPI.  The  reason  households  are 
asked in this manner is that some respondents are unfamiliar with the CPI, which 
makes it difficult to form an outlook based upon it. 
Another  reason  may  be  because  households  tend  to  perceive  and  expect  higher 
price  levels  as  a  corollary  of  long-standing  mild  deflation  and  sluggish  income 
growth,  resulting  in  an  anticipated  tightening  of  household  budgets.  By  contrast, 
firms tend to form inflation expectations based on the macroeconomic environment 
and  information  obtained  from  transactions  with  other  firms.  As  a  result,  their

Households’ Inflation Expectations,” Speeches at Bruegel (March 4), the European Central Bank (March 6), 
and the Bank of England (March 10), Bank of Japan, 2015.

 inflation expectations are likely to be more cautious than those of households and 
more closely approximate the actual rate of CPI inflation. 
In  addition,  households  tend  to  regard  a  price  rise  as  unfavorable  because  it  is 
associated  with  a  tightening  of  household  budgets  (Chart  6-1).  Households’  poor 
tolerance of price rises is reflected in their continuous perception that their present 
income level has declined compared with one year earlier and also that their income 
level one year ahead will not increase much (Chart 6-2). 
Partly reflecting such limited tolerance for price rises by households, large firms in 
particular  may  tend  to  project  a  relatively  conservative,  lower  increase  in  sales 
prices than small firms. Large firms are likely to face a greater degree of uncertainty 
in  their  outlooks  regarding  their  sales  prices;  thus,  the  number  of  “Don’t  know” 
responses tends to increase over a longer projection period – probably because of 
the  direct  exposure  to  fierce  global  and  domestic  competition  in  final-product 
markets. By contrast, small firms seem to tend to expect higher sales prices through 
labor shortages and high input costs because of their labor intensity and relatively 
low profit margins (Chart 7). 
Given that large firms project more conservative, lower sales prices than small firms, 
this  may  in  turn  affect  the  sales  prices  of  small  firms  through  transactional 
relationships. As a result, some small firms may find it difficult to pass their rising 
production  costs  on  to  their  sales  prices  according  to  their  forecasts,  thereby 
squeezing  their  margins.  This  suggests  that  small  firms  are  more  likely  to  find  it 
necessary to improve productivity and shift to higher value-added business models 
in the near future. 
Lastly, let me touch on the issue of how monetary policy has affected households’ medium- 
to long-term inflation expectations. According to a question in the Opinion Survey on the 
General  Public’s  Views  and  Behavior  conducted  by  the  Bank  about  the  sources  of 
information used in forming medium- to long-term inflation expectations, responses referring 
to  the  Bank’s  monetary  policy  (one  of  the  multiple  choices)  accounted  for  only  around 
10 percent. Therefore, it might appear at first glance that the effects of the Bank’s monetary 
policy  have  been  limited.  After taking  upward  and  other  biases  into account,  however,  the 
adjusted  and  smoothed  distribution  of  households’  inflation  expectations  indicates  that  the 
spike at around 2 percent became sharper in 2013, which shows that households’ inflation 
expectations  are  concentrated  at  around  2  percent  (Chart  8).  This  may  suggest  that  the 
change  in  the  Bank’s  monetary  policy  in  2013  has  positively  affected  households’  inflation 
expectations  to  some  extent,  leading  to  a  greater  concentration  of  responses  of  around 
2 percent. 
To summarize, developments in households’ inflation expectations should be assessed, 
not only on the basis of the average and/or median of the responses but also on the adjusted 
and  smoothed  distribution  of  those  expectations,  taking  the  upward  bias  into  account. 
Moreover,  to  achieve  the  2  percent  price  stability  target  with  a  sustainable  increase  in 
household spending, an improvement in current income conditions as well as an increase in 
expectations for future income growth is essential. In addition, households’ recognition of the 
2  percent  target  and  monetary  policy  remains  low;  this  points  to  the  need  for  the  Bank  to 
improve  its  external  communication  policy  toward  promoting  public  understanding  of  its 
intentions.  Regarding  firms’  inflation  expectations,  I  pay  close  attention  to  the  average 
value for “all firms, all industries,” particularly the average value of “large nonmanufacturing” 
firms.  This  is  because  the  labor  productivity  of  large  nonmanufacturing  firms  is  generally 
lower than that of manufacturing firms, and thus their ability to pass input costs on to their 
output prices directly affects their profit margins.

  III.   Outlook for economic activity and prices and risk assessment 
I will now focus on the Bank’s baseline scenario of the outlook for real GDP and the CPI for 
the next three fiscal years. My personal view regarding such a scenario will also be provided. 
Medium-term outlook for economic activity 
A.  
According to the Bank’s baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, Japan’s 
economy is likely to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate from fiscal 
2015 through fiscal 2016 (Chart 2-2). As domestic demand is likely to be firm and exports are 
expected  to  increase  moderately,  a  virtuous  cycle  from  income  to  spending  is  likely  to  be 
maintained  in  the  household  and  corporate  sectors.  Firms’  and  households’  growth 
expectations are also likely to rise moderately in line with continued accommodative financial 
conditions. In fiscal 2017, the pace of economic growth is likely to decline to around a level 
below the potential growth rate – mainly due to the effects of the planned next consumption 
tax  hike  and  cyclical  deceleration  –  although the  positive  rate  of growth  is  still  likely  to  be 
maintained. 
My  outlook  for  real  GDP  growth  is  in  the  range  of  around  1.5–2.0  percent for fiscal  2015, 
around 1.5 percent for fiscal 2016, and slightly above 0 percent for fiscal 2017. My projection 
for fiscal 2015 is somewhat lower than the median of the Policy Board members’ forecasts, 
perhaps  because  of  differences  in  the  projected  pace  of  wage  increases.  Because  labor 
productivity growth in the nonmanufacturing sector has hardly improved over recent years, I 
project that the pace of increase in wages – and hence that in consumption – is likely to be 
moderate up through fiscal 2017. 
Medium-term outlook for prices 
B.  
According to the Bank’s baseline scenario of the outlook for prices, the year-on-year rate 
of increase in the CPI is likely to be about 0 percent for the time being. The rate of increase 
is  projected  to  accelerate  from  around  the  second  half  of  fiscal  2015  and  reach  about 
2 percent  around  the  first  half  of  fiscal  2016  (Chart  2-2).  The  output  gap  is  projected  to 
expand  within  positive  territory.  It  is  also  likely  that  medium-  to  long-term  inflation 
expectations will follow an increasing trend and gradually converge to around 2 percent. 
Regarding my outlook for prices, although the mechanism of price increase is the same with 
the  Bank’s  baseline  scenario,  I  project  that  the  rate  of  increase  in  the  CPI  is  likely  to  rise 
closer to around 2 percent toward the end of fiscal 2016; thereafter, it will remain somewhat 
lower than 2 percent in fiscal 2017. The average rate of increase for fiscal 2015 is projected 
to  be  around  0.5  percent;  this  is  lower  than  the  median  of  the  Policy  Board  members’ 
forecasts – perhaps due to the cautious view that the pace of increase in firms’ sales prices 
will  be  moderate.  According  to  various  corporate  surveys  (including  the  Bank’s  Tankan  – 
Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan), recent price-setting behavior of some 
firms  has  revealed  moderation  in  the  rising  trend  in  their  sales  prices  as  a  result  of  the 
decline in their input prices. Given that the rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be about 
0 percent for the time being, I believe this tendency will prevail for some time. My outlook for 
fiscal 2016 is that the average rate of CPI inflation will reach around 1.5 percent and thus be 
lower  than  the  median.  This  is  because  I  project  that  it  will  take  some  time  before 
households’ income grows steadily, thereby improving their tolerance of price rises as well as 
firms’  price-setting  ability,  and  medium-  to  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  gradually 
converge to around 2 percent. 
In  the  baseline  scenario,  the  Bank  postponed  the  timing  of  reaching  around  2  percent 
inflation by one to two quarters: this was reflected in changing the expression “in or around 
fiscal 2015” to “around the first half of fiscal 2016.” This postponement is consistent with my 
own  repeated  claims  in  the  past.  However,  I  submitted  a  proposal  at  the  Monetary  Policy 
Meeting  against  the  expression  “around  the  first  half  of  fiscal  2016”  being  used  for  the 
baseline  scenario  and  replacing  it  instead  with  the  expression  “in  or  around fiscal  2016.” I

  considered  my  suggested  expression  to  be  more  appropriate  for  two  reasons.  First,  given 
that the Bank assesses that risks to prices are skewed to the downside, a wider time span to 
reach  around  2  percent  seemed  appropriate.  Second,  the  Bank  reduced  the  time  span 
significantly – from one year or more to around six months. This is more likely to reduce the 
flexibility of monetary policy. 
Here, I would like to make it clear that since the introduction of QQE, I have made all efforts 
toward  achieving  the  target  of  around  2  percent  at  the  earliest  possible  time,  without 
imposing an excessive burden on households and firms. My aforementioned proposal is not 
in any way contrary to those efforts. It is natural for a central bank to revise its forecasts and 
delay  (or  advance)  the  timing  to  achieve  the  price  stability  target  in  the  face  of  constantly 
changing domestic and external conditions. It is important that the Bank endeavors to realize 
an  economy  with  around  2  percent  inflation  by  taking  into  account  the  sustainability 
perspective,  while  revising  forecasts  with  updated  information  and  indicating  the  timing  of 
achieving the target as a reference. This framework embodies the essence of the “flexible 
inflation  targeting”  practically  adopted  by  the  Bank  and  other  major  central  banks,  which  I 
have been emphasizing since the introduction of QQE. Moreover, I would like to add that my 
aforementioned forecasts for prices do not rule out the possibility of achieving the target of 
around 2 percent over the projection period. Thus, my suggested expression was broadly in 
line with my own forecasts. 
Upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices 
C.  
With  regard  to  upside  and  downside  risks  to  the  Bank’s  baseline  scenario,  the  Bank 
believes that risks are being balanced for economic activity and that risks are skewed to the 
downside for prices. 
Regarding  my  overall  risk  assessment  related  to  economic  activity,  the  upside  and 
downside risks are likely to remain balanced through fiscal 2016. This is because I take into 
account upside risks to the European economy and downside risks to emerging economies. 
By contrast, risks for fiscal 2017 are tilted downward, mainly because of the impact of the 
next  consumption  tax  hike  in  April  2017.  My  assessment  of  risks  to  prices  is  that  risks 
remain tilted to the downside. In particular, if a deviation of the actual inflation rate from the 
2 percent  target  is  sustained  over  a  long  period,  the  public  and  the  market  may  begin  to 
believe that achieving the target will be difficult. This may make it harder for medium- to long-
term inflation expectations to rise further and steadily. 
Lastly,  I  would  like  to  touch  upon  monetary  policy  conduct.  Based  on  my  current 
projection,  I  believe  that  the  status  quo  regarding  the  amount  of  the  Bank’s  asset 
purchases should be maintained for the time being because the underlying trend in inflation 
is expected to rise steadily in the near future. If downside risks materialize and are likely to 
significantly weaken the underlying trend in inflation, I would not hesitate to consider some 
monetary policy actions. At present, however, I view such a possibility to be low. 
That brings me to the end of my speech. 
Thank you very much indeed for your kind attention.
