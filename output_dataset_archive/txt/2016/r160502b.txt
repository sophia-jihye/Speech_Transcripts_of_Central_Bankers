  Rodrigo Vergara: Chile’s March 2016 Monetary Policy Report 
Presentation by Mr Rodrigo Vergara, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, of the Monetary 
Policy  Report  before  the  Finance  Committee  of  the  Honorable  Senate  of  the  Republic, 
Santiago de Chile, 28 March 2016. 
Accompanying figures and tables can be found at the end of the speech. 
 Introduction 
Mr.  President  of  the  Senate’s  Finance  Commission,  senator  Andrés  Zaldívar;  senators 
members of this Commission, ladies and gentlemen, 
Thank you for your invitation to present the vision of the Board of the Central Bank of Chile 
on  recent  macroeconomic  developments,  its  outlook  and  implications  for  monetary  policy. 
This vision is contained in detail in our Monetary Policy Report of March 2016. 
Since our last Report saw the light December of last year, inflation has behaved as forecast. 
It has remained high, mainly due to the effects of the significant depreciation the peso has 
accumulated, in a context where indexation to past inflation and narrow capacity gaps have 
limited the decline of non-tradable inflation. 
Regarding activity, 2015 figures showed weaker demand and slower than expected growth 
towards  the  end  of  the  year.  As  I  will  describe  in  a  moment,  this  factor,  along  with  an 
expected  weakening  of the  external  scenario,  results  in  reduced  growth  prospects for  this 
year. 
In  our  projection  scenario,  inflation  is  assumed  to  be  slightly  lower  than  we  thought  in 
December.  In  this  trajectory,  core  inflation  –  the  CPIEFE  –  will  be  less  than  4  percent 
towards the fourth quarter, and the more volatile prices not included in the CPIEFE – mainly 
foodstuffs – should help headline inflation to converge to 3 percent slightly faster than  we 
expected in December. 
In  the  latter  part  of  2015,  we  raised  the  monetary  policy  rate  (MPR)  twice,  bringing  it  to 
3.5 percent.  After  that,  we  communicated  that  additional  adjustments  were  still  required, 
which would be made at a measured pace. Accordingly, we held the MPR unchanged in our 
meetings of January, February and March. 
Now let me get in more detail into the macroeconomic scenario we believe to be the most 
likely for the coming quarters, and associated risks. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
The  main  developments  of  recent  months  show  that  in  the  latter  part  of  last  year  the 
economy grew less than anticipated. A fall in mining activity, which we had already seen in 
previous  quarters,  was  compounded  with  slower  growth  in  sectors  unrelated  with  natural 
resources.  In  particular,  those  linked  to  services.  Domestic  demand  also  grew  less  than 
estimated  and  is  expected  to  remain  weak.  The  slowdown  in  its  private  consumption  and 
investment components stood out (figure 1). 
Another  important  development  of  recent  months  came  from  abroad.  Mainly,  because  the 
external impulse that the Chilean economy will face in 2016 and 2017 will be lower than we 
expected in December. The new information leads us to estimate that global growth will fall 
short  of  expectations,  because  of  both  downward  corrections  to  projected  activity  in  the 
developed world and a major adjustment in Latin America, which is headed to a contraction 
in 2016. At the same time, the external financial conditions relevant for Chile are estimated to 
be tighter, while the terms of trade will be lower (figure 2 and table 1).

The downscaling in output projections for 2016 is consistent with the lower base at the end of 
2015, and with spot indicators suggesting that consumption and investment have remained 
weak this year to date. 
On the consumption side, in the last two years the real wage bill has been outgrowing private 
consumption,  leading  us  to  expect  a  somewhat  stronger  recovery  of  the  latter  during  this 
year. This has not happened, however, which together with the sharper deterioration of the 
labor market in recent months, plus consumers’ expectations remaining pessimistic and low 
levels  of  imports  of  consumer  goods  in  the  first  months  of  the  year,  mean  that  this 
component of growth has to be revised downward. However, by 2017 some recovery of this 
variable  is  expected,  thanks  to  a  gradual  improvement  in  its  fundamentals,  particularly, 
moderate growth in the wage bill and a slight improvement in consumer expectations. 
Investment,  on  the  other  hand,  has  seen  a  significant  adjustment  in  recent  years,  due 
primarily to the end of the mining investment cycle (figure 3). The baseline scenario of this 
Report  reduces  the  growth  outlook  for  gross  fixed  capital  formation.  This  new  estimate 
assumes that mining investment will remain near its levels of 2015. Also, that the boost that 
the coming into force of the VAT on construction gave to housing investment will be diluted 
as time passes. Add to this the lower impulse coming from public investment associated with 
the recently announced fiscal adjustment. Other investments should recover gradually over 
the projection horizon, to the extent that expectations and external demand improve. 
Meanwhile,  in  line  with  the  expected  slowdown  of  our  trading  partners,  exports  are  also 
revised  downward  from  December.  Manufacturing  shipments  will  be  most  affected, 
considering  that  their  destinations  are  more  concentrated  in  Latin  America,  and  some 
sectors, such as salmon, have been beset by specific factors. On the imports side, changes 
are bigger, because we estimate that the adjustment in spending will be greater for tradables 
given  the  evolution  of  the  exchange  rate.  Thus,  the  current  account  deficit  should  reach 
2.5 percent of GDP in 2016. This correction reflects both price and volume adjustments. In 
2017,  the  deficit  will  be  reduced  to  2  percent  of  GDP,  considering  increased  exports  of 
copper  resulting  from  the  entry  into  production  of  some  deposits  and  improved  terms  of 
trade. Measured at trend prices the current account deficit will have a similar evolution. 
Given these developments, the baseline scenario in this Report assumes that GDP will grow 
between 1.25 and 2.25 percent in 2016, less than was expected in December, and in 2017 it 
will grow between 2 and 3 percent (table 2). This implies that the economy will keep growing 
below its potential for the better part of the forecast horizon, so that a further increase in the 
output gap is projected. Just for refreshment, let me remind you that in the Monetary Policy 
Report of September last year we included several boxes that reflected our new estimate for 
trend growth (i.e. the medium-term growth rate) and potential growth – the non-accelerating-
inflation rate of growth. Estimates remain as we communicated then: about 3.5 percent for 
trend growth and around 3 percent for potential growth. 
The labor market has been strikingly resilient, with persistently low unemployment rates and 
strong growth in salaried employment in most of 2015. Most recently, however, the latter has 
tended to decelerate, which along with other indicators in the same direction suggests that 
this market could be weakening (figure 4). 
About inflation, no big changes are foreseen from December. Incoming data confirm that it 
will gradually converge to 3 percent, after remaining above 4 percent during the first half of 
2016. The better behavior of some components not included in the CPIEFE will help speed 
up this convergence. Thus, by December this year we expect inflation to be at 3.6 percent, 
two tenths of a point less than what we thought in December. We also project that during the 
first  half  of  2017  inflation  will  hit  3  percent  and will  remain  in  the  neighborhood from then 
onwards (figure 5). 
It  should  be  noted  that  private  inflation  expectations  are  consistent  with  this  scenario, 
assuming that it will stand somewhat above 3 percent in one year and at 3 percent in two 
years. One important thing that distinguishes Chile from other economies, is that this process 
2

where inflation has remained high for quite some time has not driven inflation expectations 
away  from  the  policy  target,  which  attests to the  credibility  of  the  Chilean  monetary  policy 
(figure 6). 
In line with earlier Reports, inflation remaining high for almost two years responds largely to 
the  direct  and  indirect  effects  of  the  exchange  rate  depreciation,  in  a  context  where  past 
inflation indexation and tight capacity gaps have kept non-tradable inflation at a high level. In 
the baseline scenario, core inflation will converge to near its historic average by mid-2017. 
This process will be largely determined by the fact that, beyond the usual volatility, no further 
depreciations  are  expected  of the magnitude  seen  in  recent  years. It  is  worth  saying  that, 
with significant fluctuations, the peso/dollar parity has dropped since December and, at the 
statistical cutoff date of the Report, it was near its levels of August 2015. The real exchange 
rate  (RER)  has  also  dropped  in  the  past  few  months,  and  is  now  at  94  using  the 
1986=100 index, which  puts it on its average of the  past fifteen years. While this figure is 
consistent with the estimated long-term RER, the cyclical conditions of the economy point to 
a level somewhat above its current values. For this reason, the baseline scenario uses as a 
working  assumption  that  the  RER  will  have  a  slight  depreciation  in  the  projection  horizon 
(figure 7). 
The widening of output gaps will also help in the process of inflation convergence. They are 
still relatively bounded, however, and inflation’s elasticity to the output gap is low. Thus, at 
least in the context of slow growth and a gradually adjusting labor market, no fast reductions 
are expected in core inflation as a result of this factor. 
Chile’s economic slowdown cycle of recent years is associated with several elements. The 
end of the commodity super-cycle has resulted in a fall in mining investment and production. 
The  world  economy  has  not  rebounded  as  expected,  global  financial  conditions  facing 
emerging economies have tightened and local confidence levels have remained pessimistic 
for quite some time. 
This scenario has prompted a major change in relative prices. Since indexation is still high, 
for  the  economy  to  adjust  gradually,  exchange  rate  flexibility  is  needed  together  with 
domestic  financial  conditions  aligned  with  the  new  scenario.  The  Central  Bank  has 
contributed to this adjustment with an expansionary monetary policy and accommodating a 
sharp depreciation of the peso. One consequence of this and looser market conditions has 
been that long-term interest rates have remained at or near record lows (figure 8). 
Monetary  policy  has  taken  into  account  the  inflationary  effects  of  the  persistence  of  the 
exchange rate shock and gaps – particularly in the labor market – , in order for inflation to 
converge  to  3  percent  in  the  policy  horizon.  In  this  context,  the  Board  considers  that  the 
convergence  of  inflation  to  the  target  still  requires  a  partial  withdrawal  of  the  monetary 
stimulus,  albeit  at  a  more  measured  pace  than  estimated  in  December.  In  particular,  the 
baseline scenario uses as a working assumption that the MPR will follow a trajectory like the 
one that can be deduced from the various expectations indicators at the statistical closing of 
this Report (figure 9). 
Of  course,  and  as  usual,  the  implementation  of  monetary  policy  will  be  contingent  on  the 
effects of incoming information over the projected inflation dynamic. Thus, new data pointing 
in either direction will trigger the necessary monetary policy adjustments. If, for example, new 
information translates into projected inflation remaining high for longer, then the withdrawal of 
the monetary stimulus will be sooner and stronger, and vice versa. 
Under the assumptions shaping our baseline scenario, our monetary policy will continue to 
boost the economy throughout the projection horizon. Actually, Chile’s monetary policy rate 
is the lowest in Latin America and, in real terms, one of the lowest in the emerging world 
(figure 10). 
Turning to fiscal policy, the baseline scenario assumes that the trajectory of public spending 
is  consistent  with  the  fiscal  rule  and  with  the  Administration’s  announcements  that  it  will 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

follow  a  path  of  fiscal  consolidation,  which  has  resulted  in  an  adjustment  of  expenditures 
planned for 2016. This is consistent with a lower trend price for copper than was assumed in 
the formulation of this year’s budget. 
Risk balance 
One of the main external risks comes from the international financial markets. New volatility 
episodes may be repeated like the ones we saw in the early months of this year, because 
many of the underlying elements are still present. In particular, doubts around the situation in 
China, and doubts concerning the Fed’s decision on the policy rate. This, because of both its 
difference  with  what  can  be  inferred  from  market  prices  and  the  divergences  with  other 
developed countries’ monetary policies. Nor can we rule out that the increased appetite for 
riskier assets observed in the past few weeks could persist. Any outcome will have effects, 
among others, on external financial conditions and emerging economies’ currencies and, it 
will thereby have an impact on local output and inflation. 
Another risk scenario has to do with the outlook for world activity. On the downside, there are 
doubts  about  the  growth  capacity  of  China,  which  couples  with  doubts  surrounding  the 
solidity of the US recovery. In addition, the electoral debates in several European countries 
and the United States reveal a higher probability of a shift to more protectionist policies. On 
the bright side, it is possible that the impulse policies, in the developed world and in China, 
will succeed more effectively in boosting global growth. 
Finally, the situation in Latin America is also an important source of risks that, if they come 
true,  could  have  negative  effects  on  both  financial  conditions  and  external  demand  facing 
Chile. One preoccupation is the increased exposure of the region to the Chinese economy 
and the need of several economies to make an additional adjustment. All this in a context 
where inflation has risen in several countries, inflation expectations are above the target and 
the  room  for  further  monetary  stimulus  and/or  taxes  has  narrowed.  Plus  the  increased 
political  risk,  in  Brazil  and  Venezuela.  Meanwhile,  it  is  worth  mentioning  that  in  Argentina 
there have been adjustments and negotiations with creditors, which could open the door for 
them to international markets. 
At home, recent data show output and demand losing strength, a struggling labor market and 
still pessimistic expectations of consumers and firms. In this context, slower growth than was 
assumed in the baseline scenario cannot be ruled out, should any of these events intensify. 
Still, since our economy is well balanced from a macro standpoint, with virtually zero public 
debt, well-anchored inflation expectations and a stable, well regulated financial system, more 
favorable news may cause growth to recover faster than assumed in the baseline scenario. 
As  for  risks  for  inflation:  it  has  been  high  for  a  prolonged  time,  which  could  hurt  its 
convergence velocity, both through its effects via indexation and its possible impact on the 
formation  of  expectations.  In  the  short  term,  its  dynamics  will  be  closely  linked  to  the 
exchange  rate.  Thus,  considering  the  scenarios  just  described,  there  are  risks  in  either 
direction. 
After assessing these risks, the Board estimates that the risk balance is unbiased for both 
inflation and output. 
Please allow me to share some final thoughts. 
Final thoughts 
If  our  projections  come  true,  the  Chilean  economy  will  complete  four  full  years  growing 
around 2 percent. Inflation, meanwhile, will have converged to the 3 percent target, but only 
after standing for more than two years on or above the upper bound of the tolerance band. 
Of course these numbers describe a complex economic scenario, which makes us wonder 
what caused it and how we have dealt with it. Let me use the last minutes of my intervention 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  
 
to visit these topics briefly, and go in more detail into how monetary policy has behaved in 
this adverse economic environment. 
Many  factors  lie  behind  our  low  growth,  some  of  which  have  been  more  intense  than 
previously thought. Lately, this has led not only us but also market analysts and international 
organizations to make significant downward corrections to the growth outlook for Chile. Just 
as  a  reference:  in  March  2014,  90  percent  of  the  analysts  consulted  under  our  Economic 
Expectations Survey thought that GDP would grow by 4 percent or more in 2016. Two years 
on,  90  percent  are  betting  on  less  than  2.1  percent.  What  caused  this  change  in  the 
forecast? 
To  begin  with,  the  world  economy  is  undergoing  an  important  process  of  reconfiguration, 
which entails deep changes that have proven not only more intense, but also of a much more 
persistent  nature  than  expected.  Among  them,  it  is  worth  singling  out  the  evolution  of  the 
Chinese  economy  and  its  major  effects  on  the  commodity  markets.  The  effects  of  this 
phenomenon  have  reflected  strongly  in  a  sharp  reduction  in  mining  investment,  of  nearly 
three  points  of  GDP  in  the  past  few  years,  putting  a  brake  in  our  economy,  especially 
considering that in previous years this sector was an important driver of growth. 
The  situation  in  China  has  not  only  affected  the  prices  of  commodities.  In  addition,  the 
uncertainty  surrounding  the  changes  in  the  Chinese  economy  has  driven  up  global  risks. 
After  all,  never  had  an  emerging  economy  played  such  an  important  role  in  the  world 
economy. 
Secondly,  the  global  financial  crisis  of  2008  hit  the  developed  economies  harder  than  we 
originally thought. The wounds it left have constrained their economic recovery and pushed 
them  to  experiment  with  ultra-expansionary  monetary  policies.  This,  coupled  with  the 
fragilities  of  many  emerging  economies,  has  led  this  group  of  countries  to  face  tighter 
financial conditions than they did some quarters ago. 
The weakness of the world economy and the higher volatility in global financial markets has 
certainly taken a toll on economic expectations. But in Chile, the business climate has also 
been  affected  by  the  years-long  debate  about  what  changes  we  must  make  to  meet  the 
challenges  of  being  a  middle-income  country  in  the  twentieth  century  aspiring  to  become 
developed in the shortest time possible. In my opinion, it would be self-indulgent to blame all 
our problems on the more adverse external scenario. We must analyze what we can improve 
internally in order to better weather the vicissitudes that such external scenario presents us, 
how to improve the investment climate and return to higher growth rates as fast as we can. 
About  how  monetary  policy  has  taken  in  this  new  situation,  I  think  we  must  begin  by 
recognizing that these phenomena come with major changes in relative prices, as this is how 
the markets tell economic agents that they must move resources from one sector to another. 
Contributing  to  such  adjustment  is  a  key  role  of  monetary  policy,  and,  in  a  context  where 
indexation  to  past  inflation  is  high,  this  must  be  done  while  allowing  the  exchange  rate  to 
fluctuate.  Actually,  it  is  no  coincidence  that  our  policy  framework  features  exchange  rate 
flexibility as an essential element. 
Moreover,  it  is  important  for  domestic  financial  conditions  to  be  consistent  with  a  lower 
growth scenario; in particular, that real interest rates are the right ones for the state of the 
business  cycle.  In  this  context,  the  Central  Bank  has  applied  an  expansionary  monetary 
policy that is actually one of the most expansionary among comparable economies. 
Likewise, in the past few years we have made substantial revisions to our estimates of the 
Chilean economy’s potential growth. This is important, because a good diagnosis of medium-
term  inflationary  pressures  requires  a  good  measurement  of  the  country’s  capacity  for 
growth. 
As  we  have  explained  before,  the  depreciation  of  our  currency  triggered  an  increase  in 
tradable goods inflation. We expected this, since it is a well-established fact that in Chile, as 
in other emerging economies, the pass-through coefficient of the exchange rate to prices is 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 5 
  
 
high. And not only did we expect it but we also hoped for it, as it is the way to generate the 
necessary  change  in  relative  prices  when  indexation  renders  the  prices  of  nontradables 
relatively sticky on the downward side. 
In this context, it is important to understand that in our policy framework the main objective is 
to ensure that inflation will converge to the target within the policy horizon, which is usually 
two years. Of course this does not mean that we will overlook current inflation, but that we 
can tolerate deviations of inflation in the short term as long as we are convinced that such 
convergence within the above mentioned horizon is not at risk. That is why we are so careful 
in our inflation forecasts and in monitoring inflation expectations two years out: if the current 
high  levels  of  inflation  do  not  signal  a  deviation  away  from  convergence  within  two  years, 
they can be tolerated. Otherwise, they simply cannot. In other words, if inflation expectations 
over that term were above the target, they would call for immediate action in the form of a 
contractionary  monetary  policy.  As  previously  shown,  in  Chile  this  has  never  happened, 
which is a significant difference with other countries. However, it is important to emphasize 
that it has not happened because the market clearly understands that the Central Bank will 
do whatever is necessary for that not to occur. The messages we have delivered, including 
the moderate withdrawal of the monetary stimulus, point precisely in that direction. 
In  this  context,  a  string  of  more  intense  and  persistent  shocks  ended  up  causing  a 
depreciation  of  the  peso  that  was  also  larger  and  longer  lasting,  which  via  second-round 
effects has put more pressure on medium-term inflation. Also, the labor market proved more 
resilient, a sign of smaller gaps in the economy. This limited the downward correction of non-
tradable  inflation. Thus, the  Board of the  Central  Bank  decided to  downplay  the  monetary 
stimulus, at a pace that has obviously accommodated incoming news, especially their effects 
on the inflation forecast two years ahead. 
The Central Bank lacks the capacity to alter the economy’s potential growth or shield it from 
the shocks that affect it, but it can contribute to smooth the cyclical adjustment. This is what 
we have been doing, always with our eyes firmly focused on our constitutional mandate to 
safeguard  price  stability,  which  is  one  of  our  greatest  contributions  to  our  country’s 
development.  Our  policy  framework,  especially  exchange  rate  flexibility,  has  played  a  key 
role in this process. Suffice it to compare it with some past episodes where the exchange 
rate adjustment was not allowed or was tried to avoid, to later realize the important role that a 
fluctuating currency plays in this. But, as is always the case, every adjustment process of any 
significance  has  short-term  costs  to  pay.  In  this  case,  inflation  has  been  above  the  target 
range for longer than we expected. 
As we have stated many times before, Chile has a sound macroeconomic policy framework 
that allows us to adequately address the changes occurring in the economic environment. In 
recent  years,  the  adjustment  has  been made  and  there  are  no  significant  macroeconomic 
imbalances yet to be corrected. 
The best contribution we can make as the Central Bank is to simply fulfill our mandate of 
price stability. Rest assured that we will do everything necessary to make it happen. 
Thank you.
