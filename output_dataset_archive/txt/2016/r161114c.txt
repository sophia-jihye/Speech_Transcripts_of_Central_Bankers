 Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy 
Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Nagoya 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
It is my great pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with administrative, 
financial, and business leaders in the Chubu region. I would like to take this opportunity to 
express  my  sincerest  gratitude  for  your  cooperation  with  the  Bank  of  Japan's  Nagoya 
Branch. 
 At the September Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM), the Bank conducted a comprehensive 
assessment of monetary easing measures implemented since the introduction of quantitative 
and  qualitative  monetary  easing  (QQE)  and,  based  on  its  findings,  decided  to  introduce 
"QQE  with  Yield  Curve  Control."  The  new  policy  framework  consists  of  two  major 
components: the first is "yield curve control," in which the Bank facilitates the formation of 
the yield curve that is deemed most appropriate with a view to maintaining the momentum 
toward  achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent,  and  the  second  is  an 
"inflation-overshooting  commitment,"  in  which  the  Bank  commits  itself  to  expanding  the 
monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index 
(CPI)  exceeds  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent  and  stays  above  the  target  in  a  stable 
manner. 
 Almost two months have passed since the introduction of the Bank's new policy framework, 
and  it  appears  to  have  been  perceived  as  positive  by  market  participants.  Looking  at 
developments  in  long-  and  short-term  interest  rates,  the  yield  curve  for  Japanese 
government bonds (JGBs) has been formed smoothly and stably in line with the guideline 
for  market  operations  --  in  which  the  short-term  policy  interest  rate  is  set  at  minus  0.1 
percent and the target level of 10-year JGB yields at around 0 percent (Chart 1). Turning to 
other developments in the financial markets, the yen has depreciated somewhat against the 
U.S.  dollar  in  the  foreign  exchange  market,  amid  the  heightening  speculation  over  the 
policy rate hike in the United States. In this situation, stock prices have been relatively firm. 
Meanwhile,  in  response  to  the  outcome  of  the  U.S.  presidential  election,  the  yen  had 
appreciated and stock prices had declined, both to a large degree temporarily, but thereafter 
reverted to situations of a depreciation and an increase, respectively. The Bank will continue 
to carefully monitor market developments.

At the MPM held at the beginning of November, the Bank released its projections through 
fiscal  2018  in  the  Outlook  for  Economic  Activity  and  Prices  (Outlook  Report).  Today,  I 
would like to explain the Bank's projections for economic activity and prices based on this 
Outlook Report, as well as its thinking on the conduct of monetary policy. 
 I. The Current Situation of and Outlook for Japan's Economic Activity and Prices 
To begin with, let me make three points on the outlook for Japan's economy. Please refer to 
Chart 2. 
 The  first  point  is  that  extremely  powerful  economic  stimulus  measures  are  being 
implemented,  both  on  the  monetary  and  fiscal  sides.  The  Bank  will  adhere  to  powerful 
monetary  easing  under  the  new  policy  framework  in  order  to  achieve  the  price  stability 
target  of  2  percent,  while  the  government  will  steadily  implement  its  large-scale  stimulus 
measures, amounting to 28 trillion yen in project size, with the Diet's recent approval of the 
supplementary  budget.  Synergy  effects  are  produced  in  a  case  where  a  government 
proactively  carries  out  fiscal  spending  while  a  central  bank  provides  accommodative 
financial conditions with a view to achieving its price stability target; this is known to make 
the  stimulative  effects  on  economic  activity  more  powerful.  Indeed,  such  effects  of  the 
so-called policy mix are expected to be seen going forward. 
 The second point is that, on the back of the effects of a policy mix as well as the recovery in 
overseas economies, Japan's economy is likely to expand moderately, with a virtuous cycle 
from  income  to  spending  being  maintained  in  both  the  corporate  and  household  sectors. 
Specifically, as indicated in red in the chart, it is likely to continue growing at a pace above 
its  potential  through  the  projection  period  --  that  is,  through  fiscal  2018  --  at  around  1 
percent. 
 Third, on the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI for all items less fresh 
food is likely to be slightly negative or about 0 percent for the time being, as shown in blue 
in  the  chart. Thereafter,  the  rate  of  change  is  expected  to increase  toward  2  percent in  the 
second half of the projection period in line with an improvement in the output gap, as will 
 2 
likely be evidenced by a further decline in the unemployment rate, and a rise in medium- to 
long-term inflation expectations. 
 In what follows, I will explain the outlook for economic activity and prices in more detail. 
 A. The Current Situation of Economic Activity and Its Outlook 
Developments in the Corporate Sector 
Looking at developments in the corporate sector, exports and production have been sluggish 
recently, due mainly to the effects of the slowdown in emerging economies. Exports, mainly 
automobile-related  exports,  to  advanced  economies  have  remained  on  a  steady  increasing 
trend, whereas those to emerging economies have been sluggish, especially of capital goods. 
Exports as a whole have therefore been flat. Against this background, production also has 
been almost flat. 
 In terms of corporate profits, profits of manufacturing firms have been negatively affected 
by the slowdown in emerging economies and the yen's appreciation (Chart 3). Nevertheless, 
those  of  all  industries,  including  nonmanufacturing  firms,  have  been  at  a  level  close  to 
record highs, reflecting an improvement in the terms  of trade resulting from the low crude 
oil prices. The diffusion index (DI) for business conditions in the September 2016  Tankan 
(Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) has generally stayed at a favorable 
level.  Against  this  backdrop,  firms,  including  large  manufacturers,  have  maintained  their 
positive fixed investment stance. 
 With  regard  to  the  outlook,  although  overseas  economies  are  projected  to  remain  slightly 
subdued  for  some  time,  they  are  expected  to  gradually  increase  their  growth  rates  as 
advanced economies continue growing steadily and the effects of such steady growth spread 
to  emerging  economies.  Against  this  background,  exports  and  production  are  expected  to 
start  increasing  moderately.  Business  fixed  investment  may  be  affected  temporarily  partly 
by the slowdown in overseas economies and the past yen appreciation. However, it is likely 
to  continue  increasing  moderately  as  the  highly  accommodative  financial  conditions 
continue and growth expectations rise moderately. 
  3 
Developments in the Household Sector 
Next, I would like to turn to developments in the household sector. Positive developments 
in the corporate sector have steadily exerted positive effects on the employment and income 
situation  (Chart  4).  The  tightening  trend  of  labor  market  conditions  has  become  more 
evident  and  the  latest  active  job  openings-to-applicants  ratio  was  1.38  times,  marking  the 
highest  level  seen  since  1991.  The  unemployment  rate  has  been  about  3  percent,  which  is 
virtually  "full  employment."  A  perception  of  labor  shortage  suggested  by  the  employment 
conditions  DI  in  the  September  Tankan  has  heightened  further.  Against  this  background, 
wages have increased moderately. 
 Despite such improvements in the employment and income situation, private consumption 
has lacked momentum somewhat. Looking back, private consumption was relatively weak 
in  the  first  half  of  2016,  due  mainly  to  the  negative  wealth  effects  brought  about  by  the 
decline in stock prices. However, various sales statistics show that it has started to pick up 
recently,  despite  being  affected  by  bad  weather  conditions  such  as  typhoons.  Confidence 
indicators related to private consumption also have been picking up (Chart 5). Based on this 
situation,  private  consumption  is  expected  to  increase  moderately  on  the  back  of  the 
continued steady improvement in the employment and income situation. 
 B. The Current Situation of Prices and Their Outlook 
Next, I would like to touch on price developments. The year-on-year rate of change in the 
CPI for all items less fresh food has been slightly negative due to the effects of the decline 
in  energy  prices  (Chart  6).  Meanwhile,  that  for  all  items  less  fresh  food  and  energy  has 
remained positive for exactly three years since October 2013. This is the first time since the 
late 1990s, when Japan's economy fell into deflation, that the inflation rate has been positive 
for  such  a  long  period.  However,  it  has  slowed  recently.  This  is  mainly  attributable  to the 
fact  that  prices,  such  as  for  durable  goods,  have  declined  due  to  the  effects  of  the  past 
appreciation  of  the  yen,  and  that  firms'  price-setting  stance  has  become  slightly  cautious, 
reflecting weakness in private consumption in the first half of 2016. 
 The  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI  for  all  items  less  fresh  food  is  likely  to  be 
slightly negative or about 0 percent for the time being, and increase toward 2 percent in the 
 4 
second half of the projection period -- that is, through fiscal 2018. The following four points 
can be highlighted as the background to this outlook. 
 The first point is with regard to developments in energy prices, such as crude oil prices. The 
downward pressure of the past decline in energy prices on the CPI is expected to dissipate 
going forward and the negative contribution of energy items is estimated to reach around 0 
percentage point in early 2017 (Chart 7). Therefore, the CPI for all items less fresh food  -- 
for  which  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  is  currently  minus  0.5  percent  --  is  expected  to 
reduce its rate of decline rapidly and turn positive. 
 The second point is that, as I have explained earlier, private consumption has bottomed out 
recently  on  the  back  of  improvement  in  the  employment  and  income  situation,  and  is 
expected  to  increase  moderately.  With  such  developments,  firms'  price-setting  stance  is 
expected to revert to raising prices. 
 The  third  point  is  that  labor  market  conditions  are  expected  to  further  tighten,  exerting 
upward  pressure  on  wages  accordingly.  In  this  context,  how  the  labor-management  wage 
negotiations next spring develop warrants particular attention. Corporate profits have been 
at a level close to record highs, and labor market conditions have tightened, as evidenced by 
the  fact  that  the  unemployment  rate  has  declined  to  around  3  percent.  Under  these 
circumstances, the environment for wage increases is certainly well established. 
 The  fourth  point  is  that,  as  the  Bank  pursues  powerful  monetary  easing  under  its 
"inflation-overshooting commitment," inflation expectations will likely rise. I will elaborate 
on this later. 
 In  this  manner,  it  is  the  Bank's  assessment  that,  despite  the  recent  weakness  in  price 
developments, the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent seems 
to  be  maintained.  However,  risks  to  both  economic  activity  and  prices  are  skewed  to  the 
downside, particularly those regarding overseas factors. Moreover, the projections for prices 
in  the  October  2016  Outlook  Report  have  been  revised  slightly  downward  compared  with 
those in July, and the timing of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI reaching around 2 
 5 
percent  will  likely  be  around  fiscal  2018.  The  momentum  toward  achieving  the  2  percent 
target  is  somewhat  weaker  than  the  previous  outlook,  and  thus  developments  in  prices 
warrant careful attention going forward. The major reason behind these downward revisions 
lies in developments in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Let me now move on 
to this point. 
 II. Inflation Expectations and the Conduct of Monetary Policy 
To put it simply, inflation expectations are people's outlook for prices, or their perception of 
future  price  developments.  In  a  situation  where  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent  is 
achieved in a stable manner, people will share the view that annual inflation will be around 
2 percent, and such view will be a key determinant of prices of goods and services, as well 
as  wages.  With  the  aim  of  dramatically  changing  the  deflationary  mindset  that  had  been 
entrenched among people and raising inflation expectations to 2 percent, the Bank  -- under 
QQE introduced in April 2013 -- has strongly and clearly committed itself to achieving the 
price  stability  target  and  conducted  large-scale  monetary  expansion  to  underpin  this 
commitment. 
 After the introduction of QQE, inflation expectations increased significantly through around 
summer  2014  (Chart  8).  This  clearly  shows  that  monetary  policy  is  effective  in  raising 
inflation expectations. Thereafter, however, with headwinds such as a significant decline in 
crude oil prices, weak demand following the consumption tax hike, and volatility in global 
financial  markets  reflecting  the  slowdown  in  emerging  economies,  inflation  expectations 
resumed  their  decline  from  summer  2015  and  have  remained  in  a  weakening  phase.  In 
Japan,  where  deflation  has  been  persistent  for  a  prolonged  period,  inflation  expectation 
formation still tends to be largely affected by developments in observed inflation rates. As 
observed inflation rates had actually declined before the conversion in people's perception 
about  inflation  toward  2  percent,  the  decline  in  actual  inflation  seemed  to  have  brought 
inflation expectations down as well. 
 In  order  to  address  this  situation,  the  Bank  judged  it  necessary  to  adopt  more  forceful 
measures  to  raise  inflation  expectations  and  introduced  an  "inflation-overshooting 
commitment."  Specifically,  under  this  commitment,  the  Bank  will  continue  expanding  the 
 6 
monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI exceeds 2 percent 
and stays above the target in a stable manner. The price stability target needs to be achieved 
on average over the business cycle. Thus, it naturally is assumed that there would be phases 
when  the  observed  CPI  exceeds  2  percent.  As  it  takes  some  time  for  monetary  policy  to 
have  an  impact  on  economic  activity  and  prices,  it  is  exceptional  for  the  central  bank  to 
make  such  a  strong  commitment  that  is  based  on  the  observed  CPI.  Through  this 
exceptional  commitment,  the  Bank  aims  to  enhance  the  credibility  of  achieving  2  percent 
among the public. 
 Let me elaborate on this point. Given that the inflation rate in Japan has been lower than 2 
percent for a long period, it is necessary  for the public to experience the process whereby 
the  inflation  rate  actually  exceeds  2  percent  before  converging  to  the  2  percent  target. 
Through such experience, the perception that annual inflation will be around 2 percent will 
take  hold  among  the  public.  The  Bank  committed  itself  to  continue  with  large-scale 
monetary expansion until this process is completed. The new policy framework is designed 
to  enable  the  Bank  to  pursue  monetary  easing  in  a  flexible  manner  through  yield  curve 
control. Under "QQE with Yield Curve Control," the Bank will pursue powerful monetary 
easing  and  make  policy  adjustments  as  appropriate,  taking  account  of  developments  in 
economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the 
momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. 
 As  described  in  the  Bank's  "Comprehensive  Assessment,"  the  annual  labor-management 
wage negotiations in Japan tend to be influenced by the inflation rate in the preceding year, 
and  this  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  inflation  expectations  are  affected  by  the  past  inflation 
rate.  On  the  other  hand,  in  Europe  and  the  United  States,  medium-  to  long-term  inflation 
expectations that are anchored by central banks' price stability targets are the crucial factor 
that  determines  wages.  As  I  mentioned  earlier,  labor  market  conditions  are  likely  to 
continue tightening and the inflation rate will increase steadily toward 2 percent as the Bank 
pursues aggressive monetary easing. In the course of Japan's economy experiencing such a 
significant  change,  making  proactive  investment  in  human  capital,  including  determining 
wages based on the 2 percent inflation benchmark, will benefit individual firms in terms of 
 7 
medium- to long-run management, not to mention that it is crucial for Japan's economy as a 
whole. 
 Conclusion 
In concluding, let me touch on the economy of the Chubu region. The economy centered on 
Nagoya  is  the  core  of  Japan's  manufacturing.  Challenges  taken  by  many  industries  and 
firms  in  anticipation  of  future  potential  can  become  the  driving  force  for  raising  Japan's 
potential  growth  rate,  which  is  at  a  low  level  currently.  For  example,  in  the  automobile 
industry, which is the leading industry of the region, initiatives to introduce next-generation 
technology  --  such  as  environmentally  friendly  features  as  well  as  automatic-  and 
safe-driving  systems  --  are  proceeding  rapidly.  In  addition,  in  aircraft-related  industries, 
formation of industrial clusters in the region is starting to make steady progress, and there 
are  increasing  numbers  of  cases  where  small  and  medium-sized  parts  manufacturers  are 
working  in  an  integrated  manner  in  terms  of  receiving  orders  and  producing  parts. 
Furthermore,  such  proactive  production  activities  by  manufacturers  are  inducing  fixed 
investment by a wide range of firms, including nonmanufacturers. I would like to close my 
speech by expressing my sincere hope that these dynamic initiatives by the industrial sector, 
combined with financial institutions' and the local government's support, will lead to further 
growth and development of the Chubu region. 
 Thank you.
