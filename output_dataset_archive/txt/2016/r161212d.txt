  Some thoughts on New Zealand’s Economic Expansion 
1. 
Introduction 
 
 Thank you for inviting me to meet with you again.  It’s always a pleasure to be 
here and exchange views on how the economy is performing. 
In many respects the economy is performing well.  Relative to the trends over 
the past two decades, we are experiencing stronger economic growth, lower 
inflation, and a lower unemployment rate - even with record levels of labour 
force participation.  And the Achilles heel of many New Zealand expansions – 
a large current account deficit – has not eventuated (figure 1).

Economists are well known for their two-handed assessments, and it won’t 
surprise you if I mention that not everything is as positive.  The overall 
expansion, now entering its eighth year, is weaker than other post-WWII 
expansions.  GDP growth on a per capita basis has been slow and labour 
productivity growth has been disappointing.  House price inflation is much 
2

 higher than desirable and poses concerns for financial stability, and the 
exchange rate is higher than the economic fundamentals would suggest is 
appropriate. 
New Zealand is not alone in encountering these challenges.  Most of the advanced 
economies and several emerging market economies are experiencing weaker than 
normal expansions and slow labour productivity growth.  Several are experiencing 
high house price inflation.  In a world of weak trade growth and rising protectionism, 
many would prefer to have a more competitive exchange rate. 
I will return to some of these issues in discussing: 
•  some of the characteristics of the current expansion, 
 the prospects for continued expansion and the key economic risks we 
face, and 
 the role that monetary policy can play going forward. 
 Characteristics of New Zealand’s Current Economic Expansion 
i) 
The expansion has taken place in a difficult global economic 
climate 
 
Global economic growth in 2015 and 2016 is around 3 percent – the 
weakest since 2009 and below its long-term average of 3¾ percent, 
despite unprecedented global monetary stimulus and a major decline in 
oil prices.  Global trade, normally a catalyst for the global economy, 
remains weak.  Merchandise trade growth over the past five years has 
been the slowest since the early 1980s, and protectionist measures in 
G20 countries and elsewhere are on the rise.  Economies are grappling 
with the spillovers from unconventional monetary policies and 
heightened political uncertainty has also been making households and 
businesses more cautious.

 ii) 
The current expansion is longer, but also weaker than previous 
expansions 
 iii) 
At 28 quarters, the current economic expansion is the second longest in the 
past 40 years.  Annual real GDP growth has averaged 2½ percent during the 
expansion, making it the weakest expansion during that time.  Over the past 
year however, annualised GDP growth has accelerated to a little over 3½ 
percent (figure 2).

The drivers of the expansion have changed  
 
Initially the expansion was driven by improving terms of trade (which 
improved steadily from September 2009 and reached a 40-year high in June 
2014), growing trade with China under the Free Trade Agreement, and the 
stimulus from the 575 basis point decline in the official cash rate (OCR) 
between mid-2008 and mid-2009. 
 
Increased construction investment, initially linked to Canterbury earthquake 
reconstruction, and the strong surge in migration and tourism have offset the 
effects of the 8 percent fall in the terms of trade since mid-2014 and 
contractionary fiscal policy since 2012.  Monetary policy continues to be

    iv) 
v) 
 
5 
 accommodative with the OCR remaining well below the estimated neutral 
interest rate, which is currently just below 4 percent. 
 
These factors continue to be the main drivers of the expansion, although 
Canterbury reconstruction is no longer a contributing factor. 
 
Record migration, record tourism, and historically high labour 
force participation 
 
In annual terms, net immigration has been the strongest since 1860.    Net 
permanent and long-term migration of 172,000 working age people has 
increased the labour supply by 5 percent since 2012.  Annual potential GDP 
growth has more than doubled to around 2.9 percent from its 2010 trough of 
1.2 percent, primarily because of this labour force expansion. 
 
Private consumption is being boosted by the strong growth in migration, 
record tourist inflows and the 11¼ percent increase in employment over the 
past 3 years.  At 70.1 percent, the labour force participation rate is at an all-
time high and the second highest among the advanced economies after 
Iceland. 
Labour productivity growth has been particularly weak 
New Zealand’s trend rate of labour productivity growth is in the bottom third of 
OECD countries.  There are many reasons for this including: distance from 
markets; size of the domestic market; small size of most New Zealand firms; 
limited participation in global value chains; and lower volumes of capital per 
worker.  But, as with most of the advanced economies, labour productivity 
growth has been below its historical trend in the current expansion. 
 
In the advanced economies, the decline in labour productivity growth is due to 
a slowdown in the growth of investment per hour worked (reduced capital 
deepening) and lower total factor productivity growth (TFP).1  In New 
Zealand, the slowdown in labour productivity growth is mainly due to the 
reduced contribution from TFP – the average contribution of TFP to potential 
output growth in the current cycle has been less than half that of the previous 
two cycles (figure 3 – TFP is a measure of how efficiently and intensively 
other factors of production are being utilised).

The economic impact of high migration has been different from 
earlier cycles 
 
Migration inflows affect aggregate demand and supply in the economy.  
In earlier cycles the short-term demand impacts (in terms of spending 
and inflationary pressures) tended to dominate the effect of increased 
labour supply in raising potential output in the economy.  Earlier 
periods of sizeable migration inflows, such as 2001–3, were quite 
quickly reflected in capacity and price pressures, and a strong pick-up 
in house price inflation. 
 
House price inflation has been accentuated by the strong migration 
inflows in the current cycle, but the impact on consumer price inflation 
has been weaker than anticipated.  This more muted impact on 
spending is likely due to the higher proportion of younger cohorts in the 
migrant flows, and the fact that many migrants are returning from a 
weaker labour market in Australia and may be more cautious in their 
spending.2 3

The impact of wealth effects on private consumption has been 
weaker in the current cycle 
 
Growth in real consumption per capita has averaged 1.6 percent pa in 
the current economic cycle – about ½ percentage point below the post-
1993 average growth rate of 2.1 percent, despite the rapid increase in 
housing wealth.  Although there are recent indications that per capita 
consumption is increasing, the lower propensity to consume out of 
household wealth and the increase in household saving have 
contributed to weaker than expected inflation.  This more cautious 
consumer behaviour may reflect a reassessment of the ‘permanency’ 
of capital gains from household assets, and greater caution about the 
level and durability of future income growth.4 
 
viii)  New Zealand’s terms of trade and the real exchange rate have 
been higher in this cycle 
 
Global commodity prices were on a downward trend from early 2012 
and fell sharply after mid-2014.  They began to pick up early this year.  
New Zealand’s terms of trade began falling in the second half of 2014, 
but the real effective exchange rate has generally remained high 
reflecting New Zealand’s higher economic growth and interest rates 
and the positive investment climate here compared to many other 
advanced economies.  Figure 4 shows the average real effective 
exchange rate and average terms of trade during the past three 
domestic expansions.

The recovery in household savings is reflected in an improved 
current account position and lower external debt ratios 
 
New Zealand’s household net savings rate improved by 8 percentage points 
in the period 2008 to 2013 (from minus 6 percent to positive 2 percent of 
household disposable income (figure 5)).  Over this period, New Zealand’s 
overall savings rate (ie including savings by the business and public sectors) 
increased by around 5 percentage points, and this has been an important 
factor behind the improvement in New Zealand’s ongoing current account 
deficit and the decline in net external liabilities as a share of GDP (this ratio 
has declined from 84 percent of GDP in 2009 to around 63 percent of GDP 
currently).

The period of negative tradables inflation has been very long 
x) 
Over the past five years, annual CPI inflation has averaged 1.1 percent.  
During this period, inflation in the tradables sector (those industries exposed 
to international competition) has been negative – averaging minus 0.8 percent 
annually, compared to positive 1.2 percent in the prior two decades.  This 
means that pricing outcomes in the tradables sector have been a drag on 
inflation, lowering annual CPI inflation, on average, by around 0.4 percent 
(figure 6).  
 
While relative prices continuously adjust to market forces, New Zealand is 
unlikely to have experienced such a prolonged period of falling tradables 
inflation since the Great Depression.  Declining tradables prices reflect the 
combined impact of the global over-supply of manufactured and capital 
goods, falling technology costs, weak commodity prices, and the appreciation 
in the New Zealand dollar exchange rate.

Long-run inflation expectations have remained anchored at 2 
percent 
A positive feature of the current expansion is how longer-term inflation 
expectations have remained well-anchored at the mid-point of the Reserve 
Bank’s target range (figure 7).  This is despite low headline inflation that has 
pulled down short-term inflation expectations, and some evidence that 
inflation expectations respond to past inflation outcomes more than before the 
GFC (ie, they have become more adaptive and less forward-looking).5

Prospects for Continued Economic Expansion 
In the absence of major unanticipated shocks, prospects look good for continued 
strong growth over the next 18 months, driven by construction spending, continued 
migration, tourist flows, and accommodative monetary policy.  Our November 2016 
MPS forecasts show annual real GDP growth of around 3¾  percent over the next 18 
months, with inflation approaching the mid-point of the target band, the 
unemployment rate continuing to decline, and the current account deficit remaining 
within manageable levels. 
Historically, expansions in small open advanced economies come to an end due to 
one or more factors: 
•  global economic growth weakens or slows in major trading partners and 
affects the terms of trade and export growth; 
 
•  a major domestic policy correction is needed to address a deteriorating 
 fiscal or current account deficit; 
 
long-term interest rates rise significantly in response to offshore 
movements triggered by higher inflation expectations and/or increased risk 
premia in major economies.  Alternatively, domestic short-term rates may 
11 
3. 
 
   12 
 need to rise sharply to moderate inflation pressures associated with 
growing supply and demand imbalances. 
 
The main risks to the current expansion lie with future developments in the global 
economy, and a deterioration in the imbalances in the domestic housing market. 
i) 
Global risks 
 On the downside, the main risks are: 
    the Euro-area economy remains subdued or deteriorates,  with 
consumer and business confidence affected by developments relating to 
Brexit, migration and anti-globalisation sentiment; 
 
the incoming US Administration follows through on pre-election 
rhetoric relating to trade barriers, and abandons or renegotiates 
existing trade agreements; 
 
economic growth in China slows following a period of financial 
disruption linked to the very rapid build-up in corporate (mainly SOE) 
debt over the past 7 years, and a rising level of bad debts in the formal 
and shadow banking sectors. 
The main upside risk is that the US economy in 2017 grows more rapidly than the 2 - 
2¼ percent growth currently projected by the IMF, OECD and BIS, due to substantial 
personal and corporate tax cuts and a large increase in infrastructure spending (with 
no major moves to raise trade barriers). 
ii) 
Risks in the domestic housing market 
 Numerous measures indicate that New Zealand house prices are significantly inflated 
relative to usual valuation indicators. 
 
IMF data show that New Zealand had the third highest real increase in house prices 
among 64 countries in the year to June 2016.7  New Zealand also had the greatest 
deterioration in the median house price to median income ratio of 31 advanced 
countries in the period 2010 to mid-2016.8  OECD data indicates that, relative to their 
12 
      13 
 4. 
 long-term averages, New Zealand has the highest house-price-to-rent ratio, and the 
second highest house-price-to-income ratio among the OECD economies.9 
 
Several cross-country studies have assessed the economic implications of housing 
market downturns.  This research tends to show that almost half of the housing 
booms end in a bust, with downturns lasting around four to six years10.  In addition, 
soft landings in the residential investment cycle are rare, with most collapses leading 
to protracted falls in private consumption and investment, especially construction 
investment.11 
 
Even though it is too early to be sure, there are some indications that house price 
inflation in Auckland and other regions may be moderating.  This may be a result of 
the increase in loan-to-value restrictions, higher funding costs being experienced by 
banks, and tighter credit criteria being applied by banks in connection with financing 
apartment development and house purchases by offshore residents. 
 
Monetary Policy Considerations 
We enter 2017 with considerable political and economic uncertainties.  These 
include: the policies of the incoming US Administration – particularly in regard to 
fiscal policy and trade policy; the UK Government’s strategy in triggering Article 50 
and how the European Community will respond; the build-up of corporate debt and 
rising bad debts in the Chinese banking system; the nature of the future political and 
economic relationships between the US, China, Japan and Russia; and the possible 
outcome of important upcoming elections in Western Europe.  Central banks monitor 
these developments carefully, and their impact on business and consumer sentiment 
and asset prices. 
 
New Zealand’s economy has been growing faster than potential output for five years, 
and the Bank’s forecasts suggest that we now have a small positive output gap.  
Long-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored at around 2 percent and short-
term inflation expectations have been rising slowly.  The low point for CPI inflation 
has probably passed and, supported by the improvement in global commodity prices 
in recent months, we expect the December quarter 2016 CPI data to confirm that 
annual CPI inflation is moving back within the 1 to 3 percent target band. 
 
The central interest rate projections contained in the November Monetary Policy 
Statement (MPS) indicated that the OCR is likely to remain at its current level for 
 13 
 14 
 some time.  These projections are highly conditional and based on a range of key 
assumptions that relate to: trading partner GDP growth and inflation; developments in 
oil and dairy prices; exchange rate adjustment; migration and house price inflation; 
and judgements as to how the latter two factors might affect spending and CPI 
inflation.  Different outcomes from those assumed in the MPS could imply a different 
policy path.  In the MPS we assessed the overall balance of risks to be on the 
downside. 
 
Since the US election there have been important global and domestic developments.  
Ten-year bond yields in the US have risen by 50 basis points and the US real 
effective exchange rate has appreciated by almost 5 percent and reached a 14-year 
high as financial markets assess the implications of a possible large fiscal stimulus 
for economic growth, inflation and the level of outstanding US government debt.  
Ten-year government bond yields have increased by 40 basis points in New Zealand 
(figure 8).

The factors behind the rise in US rates have increased market expectations that the 
Federal Reserve will raise policy rates at its meeting on 13-14 December 2016, and 
tighten more rapidly in 2017. 
Prospects of stronger growth in the US and the resulting spillovers through trade, 
commodity prices and relative exchange rate movements should be positive for New 
14 
   15 
 Zealand and a welcome development from a monetary policy perspective.  However, 
while the 5 percent appreciation in the US dollar in recent weeks is helpful for New 
Zealand exporters, the TWI currently lies above its level in June 2015, despite the 
terms of trade being 6 percent lower and seven reductions in the OCR.   
 
As has been the case in several other countries, monetary policy has been made 
more challenging in New Zealand by low global inflation and zero or negative policy 
rates in several major economies.  This has put downward pressure on our interest 
rate structure and contributed to asset price inflation and upward pressure on the 
New Zealand dollar.  This trend may finally be turning. 
 
Another major change is the 7.8 strength Kaikoura earthquake.  Early indicators are 
that reconstruction work, including by government, could be in the order of $3 – $8 
billion, or around 1-3 percent of GDP.  This is much smaller than the $40 billion 
associated with Canterbury reconstruction, and would occur at a time when the 
domestic economy is at or near full capacity.  The supply disruptions are unlikely to 
have a major impact on overall economic growth.  Some increase in construction 
cost inflation is likely as this is already running at 7.9 percent in Auckland and 6.3 
percent nationally due to capacity bottlenecks within the sector.  Increases in freight 
costs are also expected. 
At this stage these developments do not cause us to change our view on the 
direction of monetary policy as outlined in the November MPS.  We expect monetary 
policy to continue to be accommodative, and that the projected policy settings will 
help generate sufficient growth to have inflation settle near the middle of the target 
range. 
Conclusion 
Expansions in small open advanced economies often come to an end because of 
developments in the global economy that are transmitted through the terms of trade, 
long-term interest rates and the exchange rate. 
 
At this stage, the prospects for a continuation of New Zealand’s economic expansion 
with above-trend growth, strong employment and rising inflationary pressures look 
promising.  The main domestic risk (and one that could be triggered by developments 
offshore) is a significant correction in the housing market.  At this stage, however, the 
15 
  5. 
   16 
 greatest threat to the expansion lies in possible international political and economic 
developments and their implications for the global trading environment.
