Distinguished guests 
Ladies and gentlemen 
 Good afternoon. 
 It  is  my  pleasure  to  welcome  you  to  the  12th 
Annual Primary Dealer Award Ceremony. 
 The  Primary  Dealer  System  aims  to  promote 
participation  in  government  securities  markets,  to 
foster  the  development  of  financial  markets,  to 
improve  the  secondary  market  trading  system  as 
well  as  to  ensure  efficiency  in  the  operations 
related to the Government securities market at the 
central bank.

Primary Dealers have contributed to the growth of 
the  Government  securities  market  by  ensuring 
high demand during primary market auctions.  
In 2016, the ratio of primary dealer successful bids 
in  the  auctions  relative  to  the  rest  of  the  market 
was 61 percent of all auction bids.  
 The  auction  bid  to  cover  ratio,  which  is  the  total 
size  of  bids  relative  to  the  amount  tendered,  for 
treasury  bills  and  bonds  in  2016  averaged  1.21, 
indicating  that  demand  for  government  securities 
is strong and  sufficient to accommodate the needs 
of Government for domestic finance.  
 Primary  Dealers  have  also  enhanced  liquidity  in 
the  secondary  market.  Total  turnover 
in  the 
secondary  market  increased  by  12.5  percent  to 
UGX  3.6  trillion  in  2016  from  UGX  3.2  trillion  in 
2015.

However, 
there 
remain 
challenges 
in 
the 
distribution  mechanism  of  Government  securities, 
and  we  would  like  to  see  more  vibrancy  in  the 
secondary  market.  Therefore,  the  Bank  of  Uganda 
(BoU) has introduced some changes in the way the 
primary dealership system will operate.  
 Going  forward,  all  commercial  banks  will  have 
similar  access  to  the  Central  Securities  Depository 
(CSD).  All  the  banks  will  be  able  to  open  CSD 
accounts  at  the  BoU  for  their  clients,  issue  and 
accept  bid  submission  forms  on  their  client’s 
behalf,  and  facilitate 
their  clients’  secondary 
market transactions.  
 Investors  will  also  access  their  CSD  account 
statements  through  their  respective  commercial 
banks.

Our  expectation 
is  that  we  will  have  more 
participants  in  the  primary  market  and  a  more 
liquid,  efficient, 
competitive,  and  attractive 
secondary market for Government securities.  
 The  BoU  will  maintain  a  consultative  approach 
with 
the  market  participants 
and 
other 
stakeholders  so  as  to  bring  on  board  constructive 
initiatives  that  will  further  develop  the  financial 
markets in Uganda. 
 I  applaud  the  contribution  of  the  primary  dealer 
banks 
towards 
the  development 
of 
the 
Government  securities  market,  and  by  extension, 
the financial markets in Uganda.  
 Before  I  conclude  this  speech,  I  also  want  to 
announce  that  after  this  ceremony  there  will 
immediately  be  a  Press  Release  on  the  reforms  to 
the primary dealer system.

The  Press  Release  is  meant  to  inform  the  public 
that  all  licensed  commercial  banks  will  now  have 
direct  access 
to 
the  primary  market 
for 
Government  security  operations  and  commercial 
banks are all eligible to open CSD accounts at BOU 
for their clients, they are all able to issue and accept 
bid submission forms on their clients behalf, settle 
their  clients’  successful  bids  and  buy  their  clients’ 
securities if the client wishes to sell.  This is part of 
BOU’s on-going commitment to make investing in 
Government  Securities  easier  and  more  accessible 
to the public.  
  I also wish to acknowledge the role that this year’s 
award  winner  has  played,  especially  for 
its 
participation  in  the  primary  auctions,  market 
making  capabilities,  consistent  pricing  as  well  as 
timely market intelligence.
