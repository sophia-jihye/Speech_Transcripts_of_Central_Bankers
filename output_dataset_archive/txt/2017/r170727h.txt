Introduction 
 
Mr. President of the Senate’s Finance Committee, senator Carlos Montes, senators members of 
this Commission, ladies, gentlemen.  
 
Thank you for your invitation to present the vision of the Board of the Central Bank of Chile on 
the  recent  macroeconomic  and  financial  developments,  projections  and  implications  for 
monetary and financial policy. This vision is detailed in our June Monetary Policy Report and 
our Financial Stability Report for the first half of this year. 
 
In the past few months, the macroeconomic scenario has evolved in line with forecasts depicted 
in  our  March  Monetary  Policy  Report.  On  one  hand,  inflation  has  brought  no  surprises, 
consistently  with  an  exchange  rate  that  has  changed  little  since  mid-2016  and  gradually 
expanding capacity gaps. First-quarter activity growth was virtually flat in annual terms, largely 
affected by downtime in Escondida mining company, in a context of still very weak performance 
of sectors linked to construction investment.  
 
In contrast, consumption shows a more stable outlook, driven by significant growth in demand 
for durable goods, which has offset the poorer performance of the other components. The external 
scenario, beyond recent volatilities, continues to signal higher growth in the developed world, 
with favorable financial conditions for emerging markets and commodity prices without major 
changes, after having begun a recovering in late 2016.  
 
Thus, although important external and domestic sources of uncertainty remain, prospects for this 
year and next are in line with forecasts. Accordingly, the projections in the baseline scenario that 
I will be sharing with you in a moment, assume that monetary policy will remain expansionary 
throughout the projection horizon, so that inflation will fluctuate around 3% during much of the 
period, and activity will recover higher rates of expansion, especially towards the second half of 
2017 and into 2018.  
 
Let me now present the details of our vision about the macroeconomic scenario and estimates 
contained in our Monetary Policy Report. 
 
 
The Monetary Policy Report 
 
Recent evolution of the economy and our projections 
 
The inflation outlook shows no substantive changes. Annual CPI variation has been at 2.7% since 
February, while core inflation—the CPIEFE—has decreased slightly (figure 1). The baseline 
scenario estimates that the real exchange rate will not change much and that capacity gaps will 
begin to close some time next year. In this context, core inflation will continue to decline for 
some months, to around 2%, to then approach values of the order of 3% towards the end of the 
projection horizon. The prices of the most volatile items (food and energy) will increase more 
than core inflation, so headline inflation will converge to the target sooner than the core measure. 
Thus, the baseline scenario continues to estimate that in the coming months headline inflation 
 2 
will decline to levels near the floor of the tolerance range, and will return to 3% at the end of the 
year and hover around this figure until the end of the projection horizon, mid-2019 (figure 2). 
 
First-quarter data confirmed the strong impact of the Escondida strike on the sector’s output, 
aggravated by reduced production in other mines (figure 3). Thus, mining activity fell by nearly 
14% annually in the period, dragging along power generation and some local activities, according 
to  various  respondents  to  the  May  Business  Perceptions  Report  (IPN)  survey.  Moreover, 
recovering  former  production  levels  has  taken  longer  than  expected,  so  the  effect  in  mining 
output has extended into the second half. After considering these elements, the mining sector is 
projected to drop this year by nearly 2.5%, compared with the 1.5% increase we expected in 
March. 
 
Other  sectors'  activity  continues  to  show  two  trends.  On  the  one  hand,  the  weakness  of 
construction activity and related services; on the other, the more stable performance of private 
consumption, driven strongly by growth in durable goods. Thus, first-quarter numbers showed a 
contrast between the fall in construction sectors and business and real estate services on one side, 
and growth in trade and the recovery of manufacturing lines that produce consumer goods on the 
other  (figure  4).  The  improvement  in  investment  in  machinery  and  equipment—excluding 
uncommon transport equipment—is also worth noting, which, like durable consumer goods, has 
benefited from the need to replenish stocks after several years of low growth and exchange rate 
elements (figure 5). Finally, the greater execution of public spending contributed to increase 
government consumption, which also had a positive impact on activity. 
 
The  increased  stability  in  consumption  occurs  in  a  context  where  consumer  expectations, 
although still in pessimistic territory, have improved somewhat. The labor market continues to 
adjust  as  expected,  with  the  unemployment  rate  low  by  historic  standards,  but  with  salaried 
employment still weak and still decelerating wages. The downturn of salaried employment has 
been echoed by a rise in self-employment. As we show in a box in the MP Report, considering 
workers of equal experience and skills, a person that is self-employed or works in the informal 
sector, earns around 20% less per hour than a salaried employee. If we consider that the informal 
and self-employed work fewer hours per week, their income ends up being 30% to 40% less. 
Although the share of non-salaried employment in total employment has risen in the past few 
months, it has not diverted far from its historic indicators. Actually, the figure for the last moving 
quarter,  February  to  April  2017  (25.9%)  is  a  perfect  match  to  the  2010-2017  average  and 
significantly lower than the average from 1986 (27%) and of periods of economic crises (figure 
6).  
 
Thus, the increase in self-employment has cushioned the decay of the labor market’s impact on 
the wage mass. The reduction of inflation has also helped, leading the wage mass to grow a little 
above the forecast, returning to a range between 2.5% and 3% annually. However, as detailed in 
the FS Report of the first half 2017, the evolution of the labor market may be influencing the 
repayment behavior of households, which has seen some deterioration recently. All in all, we 
foresee that total, private and public, consumption will grow around 2.5% this year and 3% next 
year. 
 
 3 
Another determinant of consumption, such as credit cost, shows that cuts to the monetary policy 
rate (MPR) have been passing through to the interest rates. Beyond specific fluctuations due to 
composition effects, interest rates on consumer, commercial and mortgage loans are in low levels 
(figure 7). Despite some marginal improvement, credit growth remains tight, with supply-side 
and demand-side constraints combined. The former matter more for consumer and mortgage 
loans, in particular because of the higher risk associated to the labor market and the increase in 
some delinquency indicators, plus the effects of regulatory changes in the real-estate market. 
Demand-side factor are especially important for companies, which attribute their low demand 
for credit to the shortage of investment projects (figure 8). 
 
Considering the usual revision to the growth projection range for the current year that we must 
do in this MP Report, the Board estimates that GDP will expand between 1% and 1.75% in 2017, 
while for 2018 it foresees a range between 2.5% and 3.5%. The changes owe mainly to the fact 
that mining activity fell more than expected in the first months of this year and that its subsequent 
recovery has been slower, as the growth prospects for the rest of the sectors have not changed 
much. Thus, it is still believed that the return to growth rates in line with potential growth and 
closing  gaps,  is  consistent  with  an  economy  that  shows  no  major  imbalances,  a  gradual 
dissipation of some of the factors that have hindered a better performance in the past few years—
such  as  the  sharp  drop  in  mining  investment  in  the  last  three  years—and  the  recovery  of 
confidence indicators. Plus a more expansionary monetary policy and a greater external impulse 
than in recent years. As for fiscal policy, it is assumed that the consolidation announced by the 
Government will continue (table 1). 
 
On the external front, the data of recent months do not show great divergences with respect to 
forecasts. Developed economies continue to show signs of recovery in a context in which their 
inflation indicators have stabilized and their monetary policies remain highly expansionary. At 
the same time, beyond recent episodes of volatility, financial conditions remain favorable in 
perspective, particularly for emerging economies. This, together with still low risk premiums, 
stock markets that have held on to positive returns, capital flows that are sustained, as well as the 
withdrawal of the monetary impulse by the Federal Reserve that has caused no major disruption 
in the markets. As shown in a box in the MP Report, volatility indicators have remained low 
during the period, contrasting with persistently high political and economic uncertainty indices. 
The gap between these indicators has caused some concern, as it could indicate that markets are 
not properly reading the risks associated with the present economic and political environment. 
However, the fact that the two indexes capture elements other than uncertainty, could justify this 
situation,  so  they  must  be  taken  as  complements.  China’s  growth  outlook  remains  stable, 
although incoming information has created doubts regarding its growth pace for the rest of the 
year and has increased preoccupation about the stability of its financial system, especially in a 
context of internal and external monetary normalization.  
 
It must be noted that in Latin America, several economies have seen activity weaken beyond 
expectations, but lower inflation has allowed to normalize monetary policies faster, which should 
help  regain  better  numbers.  Brazil,  the  main  economy  in  the  region,  is  still  in  difficulties. 
Although short-term indicators continue to show signs of recovery, solutions are expected to be 
slow.  Private  projections  point  to  GDP  growing  between  0.5%  and  0.7%  this  year,  after  the 
recession  of  2015–2016.  Inflation  has  dropped  further,  which  has  allowed  to  continue 
 4 
normalizing monetary policy. In any case, political uncertainty is the biggest risk in the short 
term. In Argentina, activity shows incipient signs of recovery after the recession of 2016, while 
inflation has accelerated, posting 27.5% annually in April. The Argentinean Central Bank has 
raised  the  policy  rate  this  year  so  far,  and  it  now  stands  at  26.25%.  In  Colombia,  activity 
weakened in the first quarter, but some rebound is expected in what remains of the year, to reach 
annual growth of 2.0%. Inflation began to decline in the middle of last year, so the Central Bank 
has further reduced its policy rate, which is now at 6.25%. In Peru, activity also weakened early 
in the year, affected by temporary shocks, like the El Niño phenomenon and to some extent also 
by corruption scandals that have paralyzed a few infrastructure projects. Also noteworthy is the 
weakness of domestic demand, which shrank 1% in the quarter. A different case is Mexico, where 
activity has outperformed expectations with growth of almost 3% annually. Inflation, however, 
continues to accelerate, reaching almost 6% in April, due to the depreciation of the Mexican peso 
and the increase in agricultural prices. The Central Bank has continued to reduce the monetary 
impulse, with its policy rate reaching 6.75%, i.e. a 100 bp hike since December (figure 9). 
 
Thus, world growth is expected to average 3.5% in 2017–2018, with trading partners that will 
grow 3.3% in the same period, significantly matching the March forecasts. The copper price is 
also expected to remain at USD 2.55 per pound this year and USD 2.5 next year, and the oil price 
will average a little over USD 50 per barrel in the same time span (table 2). 
 
In the baseline scenario, monetary policy will remain expansionary through the entire projection 
horizon. Estimates use as a working assumption that the trajectory will be consistent with the 
various measures of expectations as of the closing of the Report (figure 10). As always, it must 
be  stressed  that  this  is  a  working  assumption,  not  a  commitment.  Therefore,  the  conduct  of 
monetary  policy  and  possible  adjustments  to  the  MPR  will  be  contingent  on  the  effects  of 
incoming information on the inflation outlook. 
 
Risk scenarios 
 
Abroad, the main sources of uncertainty remain linked to the factors identified in previous MP 
Reports. On the one hand, there is the conduct of fiscal and monetary policy in the United States 
and its impact on the global economy and on financial conditions. Also uncertainty about the 
political  environment.  In  Europe,  recent  election  results  have  been  dissipating  some  of  the 
political  risks,  in  a  context  where  growth  has  consolidated  and  data  has  been  higher  than 
expected, so a new boost from the region on the global economy cannot be ruled out. China 
remains a concern, either because short-term data has cast some doubt on the future  growth 
trajectory or because of imbalances in some markets that still need to be corrected. Latin America 
lags behind in the recovery of its economies and some of them still require fiscal and monetary 
adjustments and, to a lesser extent, of their external sector. Recent political developments in 
Brazil could generate greater effects on the financial conditions facing the region. 
 
At  home,  inflation  and  activity  have  evolved  in  line  with  expectations,  with  no  significant 
changes in prospects. The same is true of the labor market. However, after several years of slow 
growth, the risk remains  that companies may need to further adjust their wage bills, especially 
if  the  expected  recovery  fails  to  occur,  taking  a  toll  on  the  wage  mass  and  on  expenditure. 
Conversely, both a stronger external impulse and improved expectations could prompt a stronger 
 5 
reaction  from  investment,  especially  in  a  context  where  monetary  policy  has  become  more 
expansionary and both external and local financial conditions are good. 
 
In this context, the Board estimates that the risk balance is unbiased for both inflation and activity. 
Of course, this does not mean that we see no clouds on the horizon, but that the probability of 
occurrence is the same in one direction or the other. To the extent that these signal a change in 
the scenario going forward, the Bank will respond and adjust its decisions.  
 
Our track record of the last year and a half provides a good example of how flexible our monetary 
policy is to respond to significant changes in economic conditions. In hindsight, monetary policy 
remained expansionary with a stable MPR between October 2014 and September 2015, despite 
the increase in inflation resulting from a sharp exchange rate depreciation, rightly interpreting 
that it was a transitory phenomenon derived from supply-side pressures on prices. Towards the 
end of 2015, a normalization process began, sustained on a scenario where growth was projected 
to  equal  potential,  and  with  bounded  capacity  gaps.  This  adjustment,  however,  occurred 
gradually and prudently, with an increase of 25 basis points in the MPR in October and December 
2015. 
 
This prudence, accompanied by a vision focused on the future prospects of the economy, allowed 
the monetary policy orientation to be adjusted quickly when the macro scenario began to change. 
Indeed, the exchange rate appreciation and signs of weakening in the first half of 2016 led the 
Bank  to  revise  its  inflation  and  growth  projections.  As  these  adjustments  revealed  a  new 
macroeconomic  scenario,  characterized  by  weak  economic  activity,  greater  exchange  rate 
stability and a faster deceleration of inflation, the Bank successively adjusted its monetary policy 
options and bias, culminating in four 25-bp cuts in the policy rate in the last five months.  
 
Thus,  in  response  to  changes  in  the  medium-term  macroeconomic  scenario,  the  MPR  has 
accumulated  a decline of 100 bp since January  of this  year, to 2.5%. With this, the MPR is 
between 150 and 200 bp below its levels considered neutral. The speed with which we have made 
this reduction responds to our conviction that the medium-term inflation outlook was revealing 
a scenario that jeopardized the fulfillment of the policy goal. All this, because of the implications 
that the evolution of the macro scenario, in particular weak activity, had on them. 
 
Considering the cuts already made, we believe that monetary policy is now highly expansionary 
and consistent with inflation at 3% over the projection horizon. Within this horizon we will see 
in the coming months that annual inflation will fall again, approaching 2%. We will also see 
months  of  poor  activity,  as  shown  by  the  latest  Imacec.  But  the  improvement  in  external 
conditions, the disappearance of specific factors that have affected activity and prices, and the 
monetary impulse itself, will allow the economy to regain more growth in the second half of this 
year and in 2018, with capacity gaps that will begin to close in the course of 2018 at the same 
time that inflation will converge to the policy target. 
 
This, by the way, does not mean that the MPR will not be adjusted again, but that in the most 
likely scenario no new changes are needed, and that the most important thing will be to let the 
monetary impulse permeate the economy for as long as necessary in order that, combined with 
the other mentioned factors, it will generate a visible convergence to the policy target. Again, 
 6 
this is not a promise, it must be crystal clear that the Central Bank will not react to one-time 
events, but to discernible and material changes in the future macroeconomic scenario that could 
compromise compliance with its objectives. 
 
The  flexibility  of  Chile's  monetary  policy  is  a  very  important  feature  that  responds  to  the 
macroeconomic policy framework of the country. In particular, because monetary policy is based 
on a forward-looking inflation targeting scheme. Also because the floating exchange rate allows 
it not to be tied to defending the exchange rate. The same as the commitment of public spending 
to the fiscal rule, which gives the Central Bank leeway to smooth out business cycle fluctuations 
that affect the achievement of the inflation target. The sum of these elements allows the Chilean 
economy to have a more expansionary monetary stance than other Latin American economies. 
In fact, in a cross-country comparison of the policy rates, the Chilean rate is the lowest by far in 
the region. Even deflated by inflation, the real effective MPR ranks also the lowest (figure 11). 
 
Now let’s take a look at the subjects we developed in our Financial Stability Report. 
 
The Financial Stability Report 
 
In the Financial Stability Report we publish on a semi-annual basis (every June and December), 
the recent macroeconomic and financial events that could affect the financial stability of the 
Chilean economy. In contrast to the Monetary Policy Report, the Financial Stability Report is 
not articulated around a baseline scenario, but focuses on the most important financial risks.  
 
In this FS Report, we emphasize that in recent times the Chilean financial system has seen no 
major disrupting events, and the information at hand indicates that it is in a good position to 
withstand  the  impact  of  stress  scenarios.  Both  domestic  and  external  payment  systems  have 
operated  normally,  while  credit  risk  indicators  have  remained  low.  However,  recent 
developments indicate a gradual increase in the latter. One important risk is that, if the economic 
slowdown continues as it has for some years, this deterioration might deepen. 
 
On the external front, the risks identified in the FSR are similar to those I just described for the 
Monetary Policy Report. Note that global uncertainty is still high, so going forward, the risks of 
revisions to the world economic outlook cannot be ruled out. Note also that possible increases in 
long-term  interest  rates  in  international  markets,  besides  entailing  a  forex  effect,  might  be 
transmitted to local rates and translate into higher funding costs for local agents. 
 
As I just said, the cost of local short- and long-term financing reached record lows, in line with 
market expectations for the MPR and the environment of low long-term external rates. In this 
context, institutional investors made moderate changes in the composition of their portfolios. In 
particular, the assets in layer 1 mutual funds continued to grow relative to the other funds; Life 
insurance companies continued to increase their positions in real estate investment; and pension 
funds increased their exposure in local bonds. Also, at the statistical closure of this FS Report we 
did not observe any significant changes between the funds managed by the AFPs, in contrast to 
the significant transfer of affiliates to the E fund documented in the previous Report. 
 
 7 
It is also worth noting that the financial position of local companies presents no big diversion 
from previous Reports, despite the fact that local economic activity has performed worse than 
expected. Total debt to GDP declined slightly, largely explained by external financing sources 
(figure  12).  Meanwhile,  the  greater  dynamism  of  bond  issues  has  focused  mainly  on  the 
refinancing of liabilities, while the growth rate of commercial loans remains low. The group of 
companies that report to the SVS increased their profitability at the end of 2016. However, about 
70% of this increase has its origin in non-operational sources. Finally, those firms in productive 
sectors that do not report to the SVS and have no external debt, posted a decrease in their bank 
debt  recently.  This,  combined  with  information  from  the  Bank  Credit  Survey,  reflect  lower 
financing needs of these firms, which is consistent with the evolution of local economic activity. 
 
The less dynamic economy has marginally affected the repayment behavior of firms, increasing 
the credit risk of the commercial portfolio. Although delinquency levels are fairly low, since the 
last  FS  Report  some  NPL  indicators  showed  increases.  This,  coupled  with  the  fact  that  the 
fraction of loans rated sub-standard remained relatively high, has worsened the quality of the 
commercial  portfolio  (figure  13).  Going  forward,  a  less  favorable  macroeconomic  scenario 
would lead to some these credits being defaulted. 
 
The evolution of the labor market has begun to reflect in deteriorated economic and financial 
indicators of households. Thus, since the last FS Report, bank consumer loans posted an increase 
in  non-compliance.  Meanwhile,  mortgage  default  ceased  to  decline  as  it  had  for  some  years 
(figure 14). Meanwhile, households' aggregate indebtedness continues to rise, most of all the 
mortgage  component  (figure  15).  Most  recently,  survey  responses  reveal  an  increase  in  the 
financial  burden  over  income,  which,  together  with  the  increased  non-compliance  in  the 
consumer portfolio, calls for follow-up. Actually, any further deterioration in the labor market 
could deepen households' non-payment behavior.  
 
The housing market continues to adjust. Sales of new homes in the Metropolitan Region have 
slowly recovered, while the prices of both new and used homes decelerated in the second half of 
2016. At the same time, the launching of new projects has slowed, in line with the reduced growth 
outlook  for  the  sector.  All  in  all,  different  indicators  of  the  residential  real  estate  sector—
including mortgage credit—show a slowdown, reflecting both the economic situation and the tax 
and regulatory changes discussed in previous FS Reports (figure 16). Lastly, cancelled home 
purchase  agreements  have  remained  bounded,  but  may  increase  in  the  face  of  a  further 
deterioration of the labor market. This could affect real estate companies lacking sufficient cash 
flows to cover the costs of putting a cancelled sale unit back on the market. 
 
It  should  be  noted  that  although  the  economic  outlook  has  deteriorated  in  recent  years,  the 
capitalization of the banking sector has not changed significantly. The system's capital adequacy 
ratio  (CAR)  stands  at  13%  since  mid-2016,  close  to  its  historical  average,  but  still  below 
international standards. Stress tests show that the banks' capital gap has narrowed over the last 
few years. Thus, the fraction of banks with a CAR above 10% after a severe stress scenario would 
go from representing 85% of the system's assets in 2011-2014, to 50% in the last two years (figure 
17). This is so because the banks that are most exposed to the economic slowdown have not 
adjusted their capital levels accordingly. In this context, the new General Banking Law would 
 8 
contemplate a gradual convergence towards the Basel III framework, which has implicit higher 
capital requirements for the banking system. 
 
I would like to end this presentation with some thoughts. 
 
Concluding thoughts 
 
The two reports I just presented (i.e., the Monetary Policy Report and the Financial Stability 
Report) provide us with a full  overview of the Chilean economy, that includes not only its most 
likely trajectory, but also the risks that might push it away from it.  This illustrates the fact that 
monetary and financial policies are two important complements in Chile’s macroeconomic policy 
scheme. 
 
One important dimension of this short-term complementary nature is the transmission of changes 
in monetary policy to the cost of credit, and the spending decisions of individuals and companies 
rely on a sound and strong financial system. As I just commented, market interest rates are now 
at or very near record lows for the different types of loans, as well as for long-term instruments. 
This adequately reflects the transmission of the MPR cuts that we have made in recent months 
and, certainly, a monetary policy that has been kept expansionary for quite some time and will 
continue to be so in our baseline projection scenario. 
 
However,  this  transmission  of  the  expansiveness  of  monetary  policy  and  external  financial 
conditions would not be possible if it did not interact with a financial policy focused mainly on 
the proper functioning of the system and the access of the Chilean economy to the international 
financial markets. 
 
There is a clear relationship between economic activity and the financial market's performance. 
On the one hand, economic activity has a direct impact on the results of the financial sector and 
possibly its stability; on the other, performance indicators of the financial sector can signal the 
future behavior of the economy. 
 
In this sense, the incipient deterioration of the non-payment indicators of households and firms 
that this FS Report shows is important. Not only is it necessary for the cost of credit to be low, 
but also for households and companies to have access to it and to meet their financial obligations, 
because it is important not only for themselves but also for the soundness of the financial system 
as a whole. 
 
The importance of this interaction between the functioning of the financial market and economic 
activity is not limited to the short term. As we have stressed on several occasions, Chile faces an 
important challenge in terms of improving productivity and medium-term growth. To this end, 
the support of a stable, deep, liquid, efficient and inclusive financial system is of the essence.  
 
From a monetary policy standpoint, this is achieved by having stable, controlled inflation, in a 
context where the economy successfully smoothes business cycle fluctuations. From a financial 
policy perspective, there are many instances in which regulatory amendments can improve the 
efficiency and efficacy of the national financial system. 
 9 
 
Considering a broad set of developed and emerging countries, Chile shows increasing levels of 
depth and access to its financial system according to various indicators, such as the loans to GDP 
ratio, market capitalization or number of bank accounts. However, there are always important 
challenges  to  be  addressed,  so  we  cannot  overestimate  the  importance  of  recent  or  pending 
regulatory changes that will potentially help Chile to improve in this regard.  
 
A first series of measures  has to do with the Law that defines actions to boost productivity, 
including  some  initiatives  to  deepen  the  financial  market.  Among  these,  I  can  mention  the 
amendments  to  the  Constitutional  Organic  Law  (LOC)  of  the  Central  Bank  to  perfect  the 
regulations applicable to payment systems established in the country and recognize payment 
infrastructures in foreign jurisdictions involving local financial institutions. Other points include 
raising  the  limits  for  foreign  investment  of  insurance  companies,  making  it  easier  for 
international  custodians  to  settle  in  Chile,  expanding  investment  alternatives  for  the  Pension 
Funds and the Unemployment Fund, as well as moving towards a risk-based model of supervision 
for such funds. 
 
About financial inclusion, one noteworthy regulatory change has been the Law that allows non-
bank  entities  to  issue  prepaid  cards  (Law  No.  20,950—2016),  aimed  at  promoting  the 
development and massification of electronic payments and increasing financial inclusion, along 
with boosting competition in means of payment. Its implementation requires that the Bank (and 
the  SBIF)  issue  the  rules  that  will  regulate  this  activity.  These,  besides  regulating  the 
implementation of prepaid cards, will incorporate another series of normative improvements on 
the payment system in general, which should contribute to favor the development, competition 
and incorporation of new technologies in the field.  
 
A final change worth mentioning is the Law that will create the Financial Market Committee, 
which  will  bring  about  a  very  significant  change  in  our  country’s  financial  regulation  and 
supervision structure, and whose implementation poses a major challenge for public politics. 
 
Despite these significant advances, big challenges await us. In the immediate future, a new draft 
for the General Banking Law has been sent to Congress, with a focus on three areas: Corporate 
Governance of the regulator, Basel III capitalization rules, and Banking Resolution. Progress in 
these  three  areas  is  of  paramount  importance.  In  particular,  a  greater  convergence  with  the 
international standards on banking capital requirements defined by Basel III would solve a lag 
that has pulled back the banking system for several years. Equally important is to strengthen the 
security network of the financial system by improving the mechanisms to administer banks in 
financial problems (bank resolution). Once this project is sent by the Executive, it is desirable 
for it to receive the necessary attention and be able to advance in the formalities bypassing the 
political processes that will characterize the last months of this year. 
 
Another much debated topic internationally are the potential effects of technological innovations 
in financial markets (Fin tech)1/. These innovations have the potential to trigger major changes 
in the financial system, which would provide great opportunities for the agents, but would also

threaten its stability and safety. Addressing this matter in a proper and timely manner is another 
challenge for financial regulators. 
 
Likewise, an area with important recent developments is the regulation of derivatives markets. 
This is a significant point of interaction between the stability of the financial system, monetary 
policy and economic growth. In the context of a flexible exchange rate, access to forex hedging 
with the proper regulation and supervision is certainly important for the various players. Chile 
has made great advances in this area with a derivatives market that has increased as a fraction of 
GDP, being above the average of Latin America and other emerging economies. In this context, 
it is important to expand the information system of derivatives, which allows to further approve 
the  internationally  accepted  standards  to  "Transaction  Repositories",  which  are  currently 
considered as important  as other types of  financial infrastructures, such as Central securities 
depositories, counterparty entities and payment systems. 
 
Summing  up,  we  believe  that  there  is  a  series  of  legal  changes  that  will  enable  the  Chilean 
financial system to improve its efficiency and stability, providing the necessary tools for agents 
to  make  better  decisions  and  foster  growth.  This,  together  with  monetary  policy  oriented  at 
keeping inflation stable over the medium term, is the best contribution the Central Bank can make 
to our country’s development. 
 
Dear senators, 
 
In the second quarter of last year there was a change in Chile’s economic scenario, with sluggish 
demand  and  lower  inflationary  pressures,  that  were  particularly  visible  in  low  numbers  for 
activity and prices at the end of 2016 and early 2017. As incoming data allowed to gauge the 
nature and magnitude of this change, the Bank adjusted its monetary policy by cutting the policy 
rate by 100 bp in five months. This adjustment was completed with a final cut of 25 bp in our 
monetary policy meeting last May. 
 
The action of the Central Bank has meant accentuating the expansionary orientation of monetary 
policy, which has kept the MPR below its neutral levels for more than three years. This will 
cushion the effects of the business cycle downturn and ensure that we achieve the inflation target 
within the policy horizon. In fact, over the next several months this more expansionary monetary 
policy will permeate the economy, complementing the impact of better external conditions and 
the replenishment of inventories and capital, gradually speeding up the pace of economic activity 
and allowing inflation to converge to target. This will also prevent further deterioration of the 
labor market and financial compliance indicators. 
 
Discerning about the change in the macroeconomic scenario, as well as the magnitude and speed 
of monetary tightening has been a major challenge for the Central Bank. We have addressed it 
with the conviction that monetary policy decisions must be based on projections that anticipate 
events  rather  than  on  the  latest  data  or  a  backward-looking  analysis.  This  approach  allows 
decisions to be made in a timely manner and monetary policy to act whenever needed.  
 
 11 
To the extent that a more forward-looking approach demands interpretations and opinions based 
on  partial  information,  different  opinions  will  inevitably  exist.  Moreover,  this  diversity  is 
essential to feed the analysis and internal discussion required by institutional decisions. 
 
Today I have shared with you two reports that reflect the institutional vision of the Central Bank 
on the macroeconomic picture, the outlook for inflation, the financial risks and the orientation of 
the  policies  that  are  our  responsibility.  These  reports  reflect  how  internal  analyses  and 
discussions  operate  in  a  shared  vision  and  in  institutional  decisions.  We  have  also  tried  to 
illustrate  how  the  Bank's  work  on  its  two  objectives  of  price  stability  and  financial  stability 
complement each other, strengthening our action in both dimensions. 
 
We are convinced that this action will boost the country's economic stability, reducing the risk 
of volatility and financial turmoil. However, as we have argued in the past, the Central Bank 
cannot, using its toolkit, avoid or reverse cycles, drive long-term growth or replace responsible 
behavior of economic agents. This challenge involves other financial, economic and political 
players.  We  hope  that  the  Bank's  diagnosis  and  action  will  contribute  to  this  community  of 
purposes. 
 
Thank you.
