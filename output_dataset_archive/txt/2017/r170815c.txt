Setting the stage 
The global financial crisis has been a watershed for internationally active banks. The 
banking industry is undergoing profound structural change, reflecting technological 
change and adjustment to the withdrawal of (implicit) subsidies in banking sectors. 
Strengthening banks’ capital and liquidity buffers – and thus private buffers to absorb 
shocks that materialize – has been a core element of the post-crisis reform agenda. Such 
policies are aimed at reducing the probability of failure for banks, particularly 
systemically important firms, and mitigating the impact of failure on the financial system 
and the real economy. Ultimately, a credible withdrawal of implicit guarantees for 
institutions deemed to be “too big to fail” requires establishing procedures for the recovery 
and resolution of financial institutions. Adjustment to these factors is taking place at 
different speeds depending on the degree of friction present and the competitive situation 
in the respective banking and financial sectors. 
The post-crisis adjustment of banks has been shaped by the interaction of initial structural 
conditions, shocks, policy responses, and long-term trends in financial markets. Initially, 
the financial crisis hit as a major shock to liquidity on wholesale funding markets. Yet, it 
soon became evident that some institutions and markets were affected more structurally 
and that many banks were, in fact, facing solvency problems. At the macroeconomic level, 
several shocks interacted, leading to a decline in credit demand and supply, and evolving, 
in some regions, into a full-fledged sovereign debt crisis. Following the initial shock in 
2008 and 2009, recovery in the period from 2010 to 2013 was asymmetric. Strong capital 
flows vis-à-vis emerging markets were accompanied by an increasing fragmentation of

euro area banking markets (Lane and Milesi Ferretti 2017). Declining capital flows have 
been accompanied by a shift in the structure of capital flows away from bank lending 
towards equity flows and, in particular, foreign direct investment (FDI) (Bussiere, Schmidt 
and Valla 2016). The changing patterns of global shocks explain why it was only over time 
that the fault lines of certain business models of banks became visible. At the current 
juncture, the global banking system has built up larger capital and liquidity buffers to 
withstand future shocks. But low interest rates and high valuations are creating an 
environment conducive to risk taking and to an underassessment of risks.  
European banks have different strategies for operating in global financial markets and 
have thus been affected quite differently by the financial crisis. Graph 1 shows that, on 
average, European banks have scaled down the volume of their (gross) assets and liabilities 
quite significantly by about two-thirds in nominal terms. This decline has been above-
average for banks from countries such as Germany and Switzerland, and below-average 
for banks from France or the United Kingdom. Changing patterns of bank globalization 
have not only affected the intensive margin but also the extensive margin: The volume of 
cross-border bank mergers, both within and outside the EU, has declined significantly 
when comparing the pre- and the post-crisis periods (ECB 2017). 
These trends in global banking markets are interacting with changing patterns of 
integration in the real economy. Over the past decades, international trade has expanded, 
production has become global, and value added chains have spanned across a larger 
number of countries (Baldwin 2016). Longer and more complex global value added chains 
can have implications for the volatility of production. What is therefore needed is a better 
understanding of how risk-sharing and the integration of global banking markets interacts 
with the globalization of non-financial firms.  
Different structural features of banking systems prior to the crisis had an impact on how 
banks adjusted to the new environment. Banking systems differ with regard to their 
degree of competition domestically and their exposure to international markets. Some 
banking systems were weakly capitalized or were weakly profitable even before the crisis. 
In many cases, banks in the countries concerned consolidated their international 
operations after the crisis. Banking systems in some countries had stronger buffers against 
risks prior to the crisis; banks there often seized the opportunity to expand into new 
markets.2  
                                                 
2   This is one key finding of a recent research project of the International Banking Research Network 
(IBRN), which has been summarized in Buch, Bussiere, and Goldberg (2016).

Policy responses after the crisis differed significantly across countries, reflecting both the 
need for intervention and the political support for different policy options. Some 
policymakers intervened early on in order to restore the financial institutions’ capital; in 
other cases, policymakers intervened more cautiously, perhaps in the hope that the 
situation in which the banks found themselves would improve over time (Borio 2016). As 
a consequence, structural weaknesses, legacy problems, and poor returns have persisted 
for many banks in the post-crisis period. 
Generally speaking, a distinction can be made between policy responses that were agreed 
upon globally and those where national discretion was exercised. Macroprudential policy 
has been established as an important new policy field after the crisis, and key 
responsibilities lie at the national level. Also, and despite international coordination and 
standard setting, national policy remains responsible for dealing with the recovery and 
resolution of banks. This degree of national discretion needs to be taken into account 
when assessing the effects of policies on outcomes.  
Given the complexity of the issues at stake, this paper needs to be selective. I will address 
the following issues: 
First, ten years after the crisis, I will show indicators which reveal where we stand in 
terms of adjustment in the real economy and the financial sector. The evidence will turn 
out to be mixed. Progress has been made with regard to cyclical recovery and financial 
sector reforms. But underlying structural issues, such as high debt levels and subdued 
productivity growth, remain on the agenda. At the same time, heterogeneity in 
adjustment across banks, markets, and countries is substantial. 
Second, I will describe the channels through which the banking sector and real 
performance interact. Sufficient market dynamics, in both the financial sector and the real 
economy, are needed to promote investment and productivity growth. What is needed is 
an environment that encourages the private sector to undertake productive investments. 
Such investments are inherently risky, hence mechanisms are required to share risk while 
preventing excessive risk taking. The Capital Market Union can be an important project 
for improving private sector risk-sharing mechanisms in Europe. Concrete implications 
for national policies may differ, given the heterogeneity in adjustment that can be 
observed. Moreover, analyzing the interaction between the real and financial sector based 
on aggregate time trends is difficult. Understanding the effects of structural change in the 
real and financial sector on market dynamics, the entry and exit of firms, and sectoral 
reallocation as an engine for economic growth requires disaggregated data. Such data 
show that the weak performance of banks and of the real economy is two sides of the 
same coin.

Third, enhanced evidence-based policy has a vital role to play at the European level. 
Given limited fiscal resources, it is important to understand “what works” and what 
constraints actually hold back investment and growth. Good evidence is needed to assess 
the effects of financial sector reforms and to improve the quality of public spending for 
real economic development. 
2 
Ten years after the crisis – where do we stand? 
The global financial crisis that began ten years ago had many causes. As was the case for 
many financial crises in history, high levels of debt which were inconsistent with real 
economic fundamentals were a key propagation mechanism. Recessions which have been 
triggered by debt-financed booms tend to be more protracted and deeper than normal 
recessions (Reinhard and Rogoff 2014; Schularick, Jordà and Taylor 2013). 
Debt levels and the financial sector 
Reducing debt to sustainable levels has thus been a key goal of post-crisis financial sector 
reforms. Nevertheless, progress in deleveraging has been slow, and debt levels remain 
high. General government debt relative to GDP has increased globally (Graph 2). The rise 
in the share of public debt is the result of outright rescues of financial institutions, fiscal 
spending, and/or a decline in underlying growth dynamics. It reflects the fact that, during 
the crisis, risks were shifted from the private to the public sector. 
Patterns of adjustment of private sector debt have differed across countries and sectors 
(Graph 3). There are few countries in which there has been a significant deleveraging of 
the private sector. Such deleveraging trends often mirror the increase in private sector 
lending prior to the crisis: While lending boomed, for example, in Spain or Greece, it 
declined relative to GDP in Germany. To a large extent, private credit is channeled 
through the banking system, including loans from non-residents (Graph 4). This increase 
in foreign assets and liabilities reflects the increasing globalization and integration of 
banking markets. This allows better risk-sharing and allocation of capital across countries. 
But high volumes of foreign borrowing may also reduce reform incentives and lead to a 
misallocation of credit.3 Moreover, the degree of cross-border risk sharing through credit 
markets remains limited, and the integration of bank retail markets has not progressed 
much in the post-crisis period (ECB 2017).

Given the importance of banks as intermediaries of private sector credit, the leverage of 
banks is a major factor contributing to the stability of finance. Highly leveraged financial 
institutions have weaker buffers against shocks and may react in a more procyclical 
manner. Higher capital in the financial sector does not necessarily reduce the probability 
of crises occurring, but it limits the real and fiscal costs of crises (Jorda, Richter, 
Schularick, and Taylor 2017). Graph 5 shows that the leverage of banks increased on 
impact during the crisis because losses materialized and wiped out part of the banks’ 
capital buffers. Especially in countries with high rates of loan growth before the crisis, 
non-performing loans increased considerably after the crisis (Graph 6). Post-crisis, 
leverage has decreased as a result of higher capital requirements and market pressure. Yet, 
banks remain more highly leveraged than they have been in historical perspective. 
Real sector adjustment 
Turning to the real sector, the surge in private sector borrowing before the crisis is 
reflected in high levels of growth. In this sense, pre-crisis trends in growth are an 
insufficient benchmark for sustainable levels of growth after the crisis. During the crisis, 
there was a fall in real GDP growth (Graph 7 and 8), which was driven to a large extent 
by a decline in investment (Graph 9), and recovery has been only gradual. Comparing 
investment patterns in Europe and the United States, Döttling, Gutierrez, and Phillippon 
(2017) conclude that weak investment in the US is mainly the result of structural features 
of the economy and of increased concentration. In Europe, weak investment is more 
transitory, which is consistent with previous findings linking weak investment to debt 
overhang.  
Heterogeneity in terms of GDP growth and output gaps in the euro area which initially 
increased during the crisis, has been declining (Graph 10).4 Convergence of GDP growth 
implies that there is little convergence of income levels in Europe  
In many cases, high growth rates have not been accompanied by improvements in 
productivity (Graph 11). Over the past decades, productivity growth has slowed down, 
and the euro area lags behind the US (McGowan, Andrews, Criscuolo, and Nicoletti 2015).  
Differences in productivity reflect reflect differences in terms of spending on research and 
development (R&D) (Graph 12) and in the number of researchers employed in R&D 
(Graph 13). Notwithstanding differences across countries, R&D indicators have improved 
in the post crisis relative to the pre-crisis period.  
                                                 
4 The output gap measures the difference between actual output growth and its long-term potential. 
6 
 
One important driver of productivity can be the exit of weaker firms and the market entry 
of new, more productive firms (Cinera and Galgau  2005), which raises overall 
productivity. The importance of market dynamics along the extensive margin for 
productivity growth has been shown for the United States (Foster, Haltiwanger, and 
Krizan 2001) and, more recently, China (Brandt, Van Biesebroeck, and Zhang 2012). Yet, 
the contribution of entry and exit to productivity growth is mainly observable in high 
growth episodes.5  
Structural changes in the banking sector are likewise reflected in adjustment along the 
extensive margin. Overall, the number of banks has been shrinking in most countries. 
This downward trend is also due to a decrease in number of new banks. Based on US data, 
Adams and Gramlich (2014) document a sharp drop in the number of new bank formation 
across US-counties, which they attribute mainly to weak macroeconomic conditions. The 
crisis has also changed the cross-border patterns of entry. Generally, banks from OECD 
countries have been reducing their foreign presence while banks form emerging markets 
have been expanding (Claessens and van Horen 2014). In general, faster growing host 
markets are attracting more new foreign banks.     
Summing up, post-crisis trends in the real and the financial sectors provide a mixed 
picture. While growth has picked up, overall debt levels remain elevated. Growth remains 
below the – possibly inflated – pre-crisis trends, and productivity growth is weak in many 
regions. 
3 
Finance and growth: Is there a link? 
Are trends in growth and finance linked and, if so, through which channels? Access to 
finance in general and to bank lending specifically can have positive effects on growth and 
productivity. Financial intermediaries provide services to the real economy by matching 
savers and investors, by reducing information costs, and by transforming short-term 
liabilities into longer-term credit. But this precise maturity transformation also makes 
financial institutions inherently fragile and potentially subject to runs. 
Empirically, the relationship between finance and growth is ambiguous. At low or 
moderate levels of debt, positive growth effects dominate. As banking systems grow larger 
relative to the size of the real economy, negative effects on growth appear. Hence, there 
are non-linearities in the finance-growth relationship, and the link is insignificant in 
                                                 
5   This is the result of work by Asturias, Hur, Kehoe, and Ruhl (2017) using Chilean and Korean data. 
 
high-income countries (Barajas, Beck, Dabla-Norris and Yousefi 2013). Three factors lie 
behind these nonlinearities: 
7 
•  Composition of credit: While there is a positive and significant relationship 
between enterprise credit and GDP per capita growth, empirical evidence shows 
an insignificant relationship between household credit and growth (Beck, 
Büyükkarabacak, Rioja and Valev 2012). In most high-income countries, 
household credit has grown persistently over the past 20 years. This might partly 
explain why the finance-growth nexus turns insignificant at high levels of 
economic development. 
•  Human capital: If the financial system grows (too) large relative to the real 
economy, it may attract more young talent towards the financial industry – with 
negative implications for human capital in other industries (Bolton, Santos and 
Scheinkman 2016; Philippon 2010). Such a drain of talent is more likely to have 
negative effects at high levels of financial development than in countries with 
emerging financial markets. 
•  Types of financial services: Positive growth effects are more likely if the financial 
sector provides value added in terms of a reduction in frictions and transaction 
costs. Negative effects are more likely if the financial sector engages in rent seeking 
and regulatory arbitrage. Empirically, these drivers of financial sector expansions 
are difficult to disentangle. Analyzing the contribution of the financial sector by 
type of services provided shows that a larger share of credit to GDP tends to 
increase growth and reduce volatility in the longer run (Beck, Degryse and Kneer 
2014). Yet, an expansion of the financial sectors along other dimensions such as 
increased mortgage finance has no discernible long-run effect on real sector 
outcomes (Beck, Büyükkarabacak, Rioja, and Valev 2012).  
Many of the factors that affect the growth-finance nexus are structural. Shocks hitting the 
system can aggravate their effects. The financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 has indeed had 
long-term negative effects on growth in OEDC countries, as captured by the loss in 
potential output compared with the pre-crisis benchmark (Ball 2014). The hardest-hit 
economies include countries which experienced banking crises such as Greece, Portugal, 
Ireland, or  Spain; other countries, such as Australia, emerged almost unscathed. Social 
costs of financial crises are significant as well because unemployment increases and 
because macroeconomic shocks have long-run effects on economic behavior and risk-
taking incentives (Malmendier and Nagel 2011).

Ultimately, empirical studies based on aggregate data cannot illuminate the channel 
through which the financial sector and the real economy are linked. Understanding why 
financial crisis are costly requires understanding growth dynamics, the sorting and 
selection of firms into new, profitable market segments as well as the factors driving non-
viable firms out of business. In essence, understanding Schumpetarian growth dynamics is 
essential.  
Booms and busts on markets and the associated misallocation of credit not only reflect 
misaligned prices that can be corrected quickly. Rather, misallocation of credit leads to 
the misallocation of investment, both real investment and human capital. Employees are 
lured into sectors and firms that do not have viable business models. Once prices correct, 
these investments need to be reversed, with painful adjustments required in terms of 
employment and skills. Flexibility of the labor markets in terms of protection of workers, 
not jobs, then becomes a crucial factor behind the speed and sustainability of the 
adjustment process. 
In Europe’s bank-based financial systems, the strength of the banking sector has major 
implications for real sector dynamics. Banks burdened with a large share of non-
performing assets may “gamble” for resurrection by continuing to lend to their existing 
customers. This may hamper access to credit for new (productive) firms. A high degree of 
competitive pressure may induce banks to search for yield and to engage in excessive risk-
taking. These issues might be aggravated if – implicitly or explicitly – banks benefit from 
public subsidies and pursue politically motivated lending strategies. 
Earlier empirical evidence documents the importance of bank-firm linkages for the 
sectoral allocation of credit in Japan. In the 1990s, undercapitalized banks continued 
lending to weak Japanese firms, thus retarding recovery in the real economy (Cabellero, 
Hoshi, and Kashyap 2008; Peek and Rosengren 2005). More recent studies look at the size 
of capital injections needed to address the issue and to discourage the evergreening of 
loans (Gianetti and Simonov 2013). 
Direct comparisons between Japan and Europe are difficult. Nevertheless, there is a 
growing body of evidence suggesting that issues related to evergreening and distress 
lending are features of European banking markets. For OECD countries, McGowan et al. 
(2017) show that weakly performing firms have been attracting larger resources, with 
negative consequences for the performance of stronger firms. Acharya, Eisert, Eufinger, 
and Hirsch (2017) link the pattern in the data to unconventional monetary policies. Storz, 
Koetter, Setzer, and Westphal (2017) focus on lending to SMEs and show that firms with 
negative returns on asset and net investment increased their leverage in the period from 
2010 to 2014.  
9 
 
Using Italian data, Schivardi, Sette, and Tabellini (2017) provide evidence in support of 
weak banks lending to weaker firms.6 This misallocation of credit at the firm level does 
not seem to be a key driver of the aggregate volume of credit. In contrast to earlier work, 
the authors also look at firm entry and exit. They find that distress lending slows down 
the exit of weak firms. This adjustment along the “extensive margin” may be a channel 
through which credit allocation also affects overall performance. Moreover, misallocation 
of credit was already observable before the onset of the financial crisis, which may have 
been one factor behind sluggish TFP growth in Italy in the past decade (Calligaris, Del 
Gatto, Hassan, Ottaviano, Schivardi 2016). 
A potential misallocation of credit is, however, not confined to countries with weak 
growth performance and high NPLs. Storz, Koetter, Setzer, and Westphal (2017) find an 
increase in the leverage of weak firms in stressed economies (such as Greece, Ireland, 
Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain) and in non-stressed economies (such as Germany and 
France) alike.

Implications for Policy 
Financial crises have large and long-lasting effects on the real economy. Just as there was 
no single factor which triggered the crisis and which explains its severity, there is no 
single explanation for the "missing" growth post crisis either. Finance certainly matters. 
Finance matters for the reallocation of resources across sectors and for the sorting and 
selection of firms that is behind Schumpetarian growth dynamics. Similar dynamics also 
ensure that the financial sector can perform its role efficiently. Reforming the financial 
sector and curing the causes of low growth can thus be two sides of the same coin. 
a)  Sufficient market dynamics can promote investment and growth.  
For the financial sector, the key implication is that sufficient market dynamics need to be 
ensured. Many of the trends that affect the financial services industry such as 
globalization, the rate and nature technological change, and global macroeconomic 
developments cannot be influenced directly by national policymakers. Hence, the key 
question is whether the playing field provides sufficient flexibility for financial sector

firms to adjust to exogenous trends, to enable structural change, and to deal with legacy 
issues. 
10 
Many of the post-crisis reforms have focused on these areas. Regimes for the recovery and 
resolution of financial institutions have been reformed; increased capital buffers allow 
institutions to better withstand adverse shocks; there has been an improvement in systems 
for surveillance of risks in the banking and in the non-bank sectors. These reforms 
contribute to the resilience of the financial sector and mitigate negative contagion effects. 
Moreover, policies for dealing with non-performing loans facilitate an improved 
allocation of resources. Insolvency regulation plays an important role in this regard, as 
does the functioning of the secondary market for assets. But, ultimately, resolving the 
issue of non-performing loans cannot be seen in isolation from an adequate capitalization 
of banks. 
In striking a balance between risk-taking by entrepreneurs in the real economy and 
financial stability, equity finance plays a key role. In contrast to debt contracts, equity 
contracts feature “automatic” risk-sharing mechanisms: investors benefit from positive, 
upside risks but they can also lose their investments if a negative shock hits. In Europe, 
equity markets in general and venture capital markets in particular remain 
underdeveloped. Opportunities for cross-border risk-sharing are insufficiently exploited.  
As regards incentives for investment and risk-sharing, the Capital Markets Union is a 
project which provides a major opportunity. It can help to alleviate constraints on the 
cross-border movement of (equity) capital; it can allow for more market-based risk-
sharing in Europe, and can help to alleviate constraints that currently hamper reallocation 
in the real and financial sectors and prevent growth dynamics from being set into motion. 
b)  Structured policy evaluations are needed to assess the effects of post-crisis financial 
sector reforms. 
After the crisis, several major reform initiatives for the financial sector were launched. So 
far, national and international bodies have focused on the monitoring of the 
implementation of these reforms (FSB 2016). Answering the question of how financial 
sector reforms have affected market dynamics and the real economy requires going a step 
further. It requires a framework for the evaluation of reform effects, which makes it 
possible to attribute observed trends in banking systems and financial markets to reforms, 
while taking account of differences in adjustment across banks, countries, and over time.  
11 
 
One crucial objective of policy evaluation is the distinction between effects of reforms on 
individual firms and effects on the financial system. (Short-term) costs of reforms for the 
private sector such as costs of compliance are often more visible and easier to measure 
than longer-terms benefits for society as a whole. Some of these benefits arise through 
shifts in costs from the public to the private sector: withdrawing implicit public 
guarantees for financial institutions increases the costs of debt because creditors cannot 
rely on bailouts and thus demand higher risk premia. This will show up as a private cost. 
Yet, society as a whole benefits if the financial system becomes more stable and if risk is 
not shifted to the public sector.  
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has recently developed a framework which will form 
the basis of internationally coordinated efforts aimed at assessing reform effects (FSB 
2017). At their summit in July 2017, G20 Leaders expressed their support for this 
framework for the post-implementation evaluation of the effects of the G20 financial 
regulatory reforms (G20 2017). This framework will guide ex-post evaluation work by the 
FSB and international standard setting bodies. The purpose of such evaluation work is to 
ascertain whether the G20 financial regulatory reforms are achieving their intended 
outcomes, and to help detect any material unintended consequences that may have to be 
addressed, without compromising on the resilience objectives of the reforms. Among 
other things, the framework identifies methods that are useful for policy evaluation and 
discusses how well such methods address the challenges inherent in such analyses. The 
framework also specifies processes to be followed in evaluation work.  
To see why structured policy evaluation is needed, take the effects of increased capital 
requirements which are a key element of the post-crisis reform agenda. Better capitalized 
banks are more resilient and can lend more to the real economy. At the same time, post-
reform trends in bank lending have differed across countries, banks, and industries. This 
raises a number of questions: Has lending declined because of weaker credit demand? Are 
banks lending more prudently? What has been the impact of regulations on stability and 
growth? Does bank lending support sectoral reallocation – and thus growth? And what 
has been the effect of increased non-bank competition? Aggregate time trends in lending 
do not answer these questions – and do not provide a good basis for policy decisions. 
Rather, the detailed data across jurisdictions and the empirical methods for (causal) 
identification that are available can lay the basis for more informed policy decisions. 
c)  Better evidence is also needed in order to promote growth-friendly policies. 
The need for good policy evaluation goes beyond the financial sector. In order to enhance 
growth and productivity, incentives for investment and risk sharing are needed. Binding 
12 
 
constraints for investment and productivity growth need to be identified. Are funding 
constraints, the lack of skilled personnel, or bottlenecks in the public infrastructure major 
impediments for investment? What types of investments promise the biggest returns? 
Answers to these questions have major implications for economic policy. Without good 
answers, providing additional (public) funding might not alleviate the most binding 
constraints and even lead to a misallocation of resources.  
Enhancing evidence-based policy making in Europe, learning from best practice, and 
establishing guidelines for good policy evaluations is a European project which promises 
high returns. Policy evaluation is key, in particular during times of strained public 
finances. Instead of emphasizing the volume of spending, focus should also be on the 
quality of spending. The European Commission has a tradition of promoting evidence-
based policy making. Strengthening this approach and focusing on “what works” could be 
an important step forward for Europe. 
In Europe, there are several initiatives for promoting evidence-based policymaking. The 
European Commission has formulated “Better Regulation Guidelines” which set out key 
principles for evaluations with a requirement for qualitative, and where possible, 
quantitative assessments of regulations and policy measures taken.7  
Strengthening evidence-based policy-making at the European level can also build upon 
and strengthen existing national initiatives. In the Netherlands, the Bureau for Economic 
Policy Analysis (CPB) is an independent part of the ministry of economic affairs, which 
regularly analyses the costs and benefits of policy initiatives. In Germany, the National 
Regulatory Control Council (Normenkontrollrat) is tasked with the quantification of the 
administrative costs of regulatory initiatives. It was founded as part of a government 
program to reduce the costs of bureaucracy and to improve legislation (Bundesregierung 
2006). This council recently proposed expanding the scope of its analyses as well as taking 
into account total economic costs and second-round effects (such as effects on 
competition, employment or R&D) (NKR 2015). 
Better policy evaluations can have major benefits for the private and the public sector. For 
the public sector, providing cost-benefit analyses and causal impact assessments is part of 
accountability to the general public. For the private sector, policy evaluation can be 
beneficial because it helps to focus policy initiatives on the relevant constraints and the 
role that policy has in alleviating such constraints. This helps to focus attention on 
relevant policy issues and in striking a better balance between the roles of the state and 
                                                 
7   This includes causal identification of effects of policy interventions: “Evaluation looks for evidence of 
causality – i.e. did the intervention bring about the expected changes or were there other unintended or 
unexpected changes.”  (European Commission 2015, p.50)

the private sector. Policy evaluation does not change responsibilities for policy decisions 
and implementation. Rather, the European level has an important role to play in terms of 
providing guidelines for policy evaluation, coordinating evaluations across countries, and 
providing access to information on evaluation results.

Graph 9: Gross fixed capital formation (annual growth rate) 
Graph  9  shows  the  development  of  the  growth  rate  of  capital  formation.  Gross  fixed  capital  formation 
(GFCF)  is  defined  as  the  acquisition  (including  purchases  of  new  or  second-hand  assets)  and  creation  of 
assets by producers for their own use, minus disposals of produced fixed assets. The relevant assets relate to 
products that are intended for use in the production of other goods and services for a period of more than 
one year. Vertical line separates the pre-crisis period (up to 2007) from the crisis period (as of 2008).

Graph 11: Productivity (1999 = 100) 
Graph  11  shows  the  development  of  multifactor  productivity  (MFP).  MFP  reflects  the  overall  efficiency 
with which labour and capital inputs are used together in the production process. Changes in MFP reflect 
the  effects  of  changes  in  management  practices,  brand  names,  organizational  change,  general  knowledge, 
network  effects,  spillovers  from  production  factors,  adjustment  costs,  economies  of  scale,  the  effects  of 
imperfect competition and measurement errors. Growth in MFP is measured as a residual, i.e. that part of 
GDP growth that cannot be explained by changes in labour and capital inputs. In simple terms, therefore, if 
labour and capital inputs remained unchanged between two periods, any changes in output would reflect 
changes in MFP. This indicator is measured as an index and in annual growth rates. No data available for 
Greece and 2016. Vertical line separates the pre-crisis period (up to 2007) from the crisis period (as of 2008).

Graph 12: Research and development expenditure (% of GDP) 
Graph 12 plots the average R&D expenditures (% of GDP) in the pre-crisis (1999-2007) against the average 
R&D expenditures in the crisis period (2008-2014). No data available for 2015 and 2016. Expenditures for 
research and development are current and capital expenditures (both public and private) on creative work 
undertaken systematically to increase knowledge, including knowledge of humanity, culture, and society, 
and  the  use  of  knowledge  for  new  applications.  R&D  covers  basic  research,  applied  research,  and 
experimental development.

Graph 13: Researchers in R&D (per million persons) 
Graph 13 plots the average number of researchers in R&D (per million persons) in the pre-crisis (1999-2007) 
against the number of researchers in R&D in the crisis period (2008-2014). No data available for 2015 and 
2016.  Researchers  in  R&D  are  professionals  engaged  in  the  conception  or  creation  of  new  knowledge, 
products, processes, methods, or systems and in the management of the projects concerned.
