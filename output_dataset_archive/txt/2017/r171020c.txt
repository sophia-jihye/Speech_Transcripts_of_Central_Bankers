Introduction 
 Mr.  President  of  the  Senate,  Senator  Andrés  Zaldívar,  honorable  senators,  ladies, 
gentlemen, 
Thank you for inviting the Board of the Central Bank of Chile to present our September 
Monetary Policy Report.  As is the case every September, its publication coincides with 
the annual report that, as provided for in the CBC’s Organic Law, we must submit to the 
Senate. The report I will be summarizing for you now depicts the Board’s vision about 
the recent macroeconomic and financial developments in Chile and the world, together 
with prospects and implications for the conduct of monetary policy. It also includes the 
CBC’s  financial  results  for  the  first  half  of  the  year,  plus the  results  of  international 
reserves management and a summary of the main decisions adopted by the Board this 
year to date.  
This presentation will describe two additions to the traditional report, namely an analysis 
of the determinants of trend GDP in Chile —as a supplement to the Report— and some 
refinements  that  the  Board  has  decided  to  apply  to  the  monetary  policy  process, 
summarized in a box alongside the main text. 
With these additions, we reaffirm the Board's decision to not only disclose rigorously 
how the institution is managed, but also use its autonomy to improve the quality and 
transparency of its processes beyond what it is strictly required by law. 
The Monetary Policy Report  
In  recent  months,  inflation  and  growth  were  below  the  estimates  in  the  June  Report. 
However, the main differences were related to factors that we consider to be transitory, 
in particular supply-side factors that affected the performance of activity and the level of 
certain prices. For this reason, neither the outlook for the economy for the next two years 
nor  the  general  orientation  of  monetary  policy,  differs  much  from  the  projections 
contained in it.  
In the baseline scenario I will examine in a moment, core inflation —the CPIEFE— will 
gradually return to 3% as from mid-2018, after several months around 2%, while headline 
inflation will rise somewhat faster, as prices of its most volatile components return to 
their  historical  patterns  and  market  expectations  about  the  world  prices  of  fuel  and 
foodstuffs are confirmed. 
We expect GDP growth to pick up beginning in the second half of this year. With this, 
the activity gap should remain fairly stable for some time, to begin closing gradually 
towards the second half of 2018.  
In this context, the Board of the CBC has kept the monetary policy interest rate (MPR) 
at 2.5% and in the baseline scenario it expects to maintain a significant monetary impulse 
throughout the next two years, with an MPR that, in baseline scenario conditions, should 
1 
                  remain around its current levels and start approaching neutrality only when the economy 
begins to close the activity gap. 
Now,  let  me  describe  in  further  detail  what  we  estimate  to  be  the  most  likely 
macroeconomic scenario for the coming quarters and its related risks. 
At July, annual CPI inflation descended to 1.7%, thus accumulating a sharper fall than 
was foreseen in June. Its core component has evolved in line with forecasts, to near 2% 
annually,  and  continues  to  reflect  slightly  negative  annual  variation  rates  for  goods 
inflation, and above 3% for services (figure 1). The evolution of the more volatile prices, 
particularly of fresh fruits and vegetables, has been a major factor in inflation falling 
below expectations. This is mainly associated with the unusual seasonal behavior that 
some products exhibited this year. Going forward, these prices are expected to be in line 
with historic patterns and help bring inflation to the target. Still, by their nature, these 
products can always be a source of inflationary surprises. 
In the second quarter, GDP rose 0.9% annually, with other sectors growing 1.1%, less 
than expected in June. The economy was affected by significant differences in the number 
of days worked, including an irrevocable holiday in April, whose impact was higher than 
estimated. In fact, in annual terms, the seasonally-adjusted series of total and other GDP 
grew more than the original series: 1.3% and 1.5% respectively (figure 2). Second-quarter 
activity was also influenced by some one-time shocks that hit the manufacturing industry. 
Even so, the stronger impulse of the more consumer-related activities, such as trade and 
services,  continues  to  stand  out,  while  some  investment-related  sectors,  such  as 
construction and some business services, have weakened further. 
Total domestic demand increased 3.9% annually in the second quarter, with significant 
inventory build-up, partly responding to replenishments after a long period of depletion. 
However, there are signs that it may have been more than the state of the cycle would 
suggest, which could result in reduced imports in the coming months. 
In  turn,  final  domestic  demand  —excluding  inventories—  was  somewhat  lower  than 
expected,  and  continued  to  account  for  the  dissimilar  behavior  of  consumption  and 
investment  (figure  3).  Consumption  shows  a  somewhat  stronger  growth,  with 
improvements in several of its fundamentals. One important concern about the economy 
early  in  the  year  was  the  deterioration  of  the  labor  market,  in  particular  the  salaried 
employment drop in annual terms. This was one of the risk factors that led us to accelerate 
the MPR reduction at the beginning of the year. This risk has faded in recent months. 
Indeed,  in  the  last  few  months  salaried  employment  has  resumed  its  positive  annual 
variation rates and some of its quality indicators have ceased to deteriorate. Among them, 
an increase in private employment under contract and a decrease in involuntary part-time 
work are worth singling out. Self-employment, although growing at a higher rate than its 
salaried counterpart, has slowed down and the unemployment rate is now near its levels 
of a year ago, slightly higher than at the end of the first quarter (figure 4).  
Nominal wages' annual growth rate stopped falling. In June they expanded between 4.4% 
and 5.0%, compared with rates of 5.5% and 6.0% in June of 2016. Real wages increased 
 
2 
        their annual variation, mainly due to low inflation. All this contributed to real incomes, 
measured by the real wage bill, slightly increasing their annual growth rate, to 3%. Add 
to this that consumer expectations have improved systematically in the last five months, 
although they are still in pessimistic territory. Moreover, the cost of credit is at record 
lows, consistent with the expansionary instance of monetary policy (figure 5).  
Unlike  consumption,  investment  remains  weak,  especially its  construction  and  works 
component, which has steepened its annual fall from mid-2016, hand in hand with a drop 
in  housing  investment  and  reduced  public  investment.  Investment  in  machinery  and 
equipment,  despite  some  annual  deceleration  from  the  previous  quarter,  continues  to 
outperform recent years, especially after discounting the non-regular transportation item, 
thus accumulating a nine-month string of positive growth rates (figure 6). 
On the external side, a more favorable scenario for the emerging world and Chile has 
been strengthening. The terms of trade have improved, with copper prices above $3 per 
pound in recent weeks. This, in a context in which the price of oil, with fluctuations and 
considering the Brent - WTI average, is slightly below those at the cutoff date of the 
previous Report. The copper price rise has coincided with a well-stocked market despite 
supply-side problems, in the context of a weak dollar. China's low interest rates and better 
performance lend support to higher prices in the short term. In any case, although its price 
is not expected to remain stable, it is projected to average more than June's estimates. In 
our baseline scenario, the pound of copper should trade at an average of $2.75 in 2017-
2018, and at $2.70 in 2019. 
Stronger economic growth in the developed world has also consolidated. The United 
States, like it did several quarters ago, shows a good performance of consumption and a 
dynamic labor market. Europe has seen a strong recovery in its growth rates, all across 
the economies making up the group, beyond the differences that persist among them in 
variables  such  as  the  size  of  the  gap  and  the  unemployment  rate.  Growth  in  Japan 
surprised positively, and expectations have been revised upwards.  
Meanwhile, inflation has tended to subside and the monetary authorities of the developed 
world have made no big changes to their monetary policy strategies. Nevertheless, the 
market has been incorporating some moderation into its vision of the US monetary policy 
and  some  more  intensity  in  that  of  the  Eurozone,  which  partly  explains  the  global 
depreciation of the dollar.  
Emerging  currencies  have  benefited  from  the  weak  dollar,  the  better  prices  of 
commodities and increased risk appetite. Comparing the statistical closures of this and 
the previous Reports, the peso has appreciated by around 4.5%, which, in real terms, 
translates into a decrease of approximately 3.5% of the real exchange rate. Thus, at the 
last cutoff date it was fluctuating around 90 in its 1986 = 100 measurement, lower than 
its averages of the last 15 or 20 years. Moreover, in the days following the statistical 
closure, the peso has continued to appreciate in both nominal and real terms. As a working 
assumption, the baseline scenario of this Report assumes a slight depreciation in real 
terms over the projection horizon (figure 7).  
 
3 
       Turning to the performance of the emerging economies, in the first half of the year China 
grew 6.9% annually, exceeding expectations. These figures raise the baseline scenario 
estimate, although some moderation in activity is assumed for the second half, in line 
with the latest data on manufacturing output, retail sales and investment (figure 8). In 
Latin  America,  the  recovery  of  activity  has  been  slower,  with  poor  performance  of 
investment  and  sectors  unrelated  with  natural  resources.  This,  despite  the  favorable 
external scenario and the fact that the lower inflation has allowed to boost the monetary 
impulse, which is partly associated with idiosyncratic factors.  
Although  somewhat  less  severe,  the  problems  of  fiscal  consolidation  in  Brazil  and 
Argentina, the political definitions during this and next year, concerns about the future of 
NAFTA and its effects on Mexico, among others, continue to worry. In Colombia, the 
decrease in consumption resulting from the VAT increase and the fragility of its labor 
market, have resulted in slower growth than foreseen by the market. Activity in Mexico 
has been more resilient than the market expected, beyond the lower performance in the 
margin due to seasonal factors. In Peru, GDP growth has tended to stabilize and shows 
some signs of recovery. This, after the weakening in the second half of last year, partly 
due  to  the El  Niño phenomenon  and paralyzed  infrastructure projects. There is  some 
improvement in activity data from Brazil, but from very negative figures and with still 
quite low growth rates. 
Thus, our baseline scenario projects that our trading partners’ activity will be slightly 
better than we thought in June and that terms of trade will be higher, all within a context 
of  favorable  financial  conditions.  Thus,  the  Chilean  economy  will  receive  a  stronger 
impulse from abroad over the projection horizon (table 1). 
As is the norm in the Report we publish every September, the baseline scenario includes 
our annual revision to trend and potential GDP estimates for the Chilean economy. These 
are summarized in the Report’s box V.1. Also, this time around, we have attached to the 
Report a supplement describing a body of background information on the determinants 
of and perspectives for Chile’s trend growth over the next 30 years. I will come back to 
the contents of this document in a few minutes.  
Our estimates suggest that Chile's trend GDP growth over the next ten years is in the 
range of 3% to 3.5%, quite comparable to our estimates a year ago. This range implies, 
among other things, that investment again grows in line with GDP; that the productivity 
of sectors other than natural resources grows near its average of the last 20 years; and that 
immigration and increasing female participation partially offset the effects of the aging 
population on the labor force.  
With regard to potential growth, at the shortest terms, investment and productivity show 
below-trend growth rates, so potential growth is lower than trend. Thus, potential GDP 
growth is now estimated to be around 2.5%, compared to the 2.5% to 3.0% we estimated 
in  September  2016.  With  this,  the  current  activity  gap  is  somewhat  narrower  than 
previously estimated, even considering that the evolution of GDP has also been somewhat 
lower (figure 9). For the purposes of monetary policy, the evolution of the activity gap is 
still consistent with an economy needing an important monetary impulse throughout the 
 
4 
      projection horizon. In addition, the Board continues to estimate the neutral interest rate 
to be between 1% and 1.5% in real terms. 
In our baseline scenario, we continue to forecast that GDP will gradually regain higher 
expansion  rates,  backed  by  favorable  external  conditions,  the  end  of  the  mining 
investment adjustment, no big macroeconomic mismatches and a clearly expansionary 
monetary policy stance. This scenario also assumes that fiscal policy will remain on its 
consolidation path, expressed in the immediate future in the upcoming budget aligned 
with the Administration’s commitments. All this in a context in which potential growth 
steadily approaches trend-consistent levels.  
Accordingly, our projections show no major changes compared to our June estimates. 
For this year, we foresee that the economy will grow between 1.25% and 1.75% (1% to 
1.75% in June). For 2018, we continue to expect growth to pick up, to a range between 
2.5%  and  3.5%,  identical  to  our  June  forecast.  On  the  expenditure  side,  our  growth 
forecast for private consumption is slightly adjusted upward in 2017, considering the 
rebound of the real wage bill observed so far, the recovery of confidence indicators, the 
necessary  replenishment  of  durable goods inventories  and  an appreciation of  the real 
exchange rate. In investment, the downward adjustment of projections for 2017 stems 
primarily  from  construction,  including  the  mining,  infrastructure  and  housing 
components. This latter one because of the high stock of new homes for sale that still 
persists. Thus, by 2017 a contraction of this component of gross fixed capital formation 
is expected, while the machinery and equipment component is slightly adjusted upwards, 
reflecting the actual data to date and also the steady growth in imports of capital goods 
excluding non-regular transportation. 
Externally, exports are forecast to contract this year as a result of some supply-side shocks 
in manufacturing and mining downtime in the first half of the year, which has already 
been reflected in lower shipments from the sector. However, as these factors are estimated 
to be transitory, by 2018 these shipments should post a visible recovery. For the purposes 
of the trade balance, the aforementioned increase in the terms of trade, in particular the 
higher price of copper, translates into an increase in valued copper exports, which more 
than offsets the lower volumes of non-mining exports. However, in a context of higher 
copper prices and lower costs in the mining industry, rents paid abroad increase, so in 
2017, the current account has a slightly bigger deficit than was forecast in June (table 2).  
Inflation has been below expectations, standing at 1.7% annually in July. Although the 
evolution of core inflation was not very different from projections, the unusual drop in 
the fruits and vegetables component during these months has taken a little more than half 
a percentage point off annual inflation. Added to this is the significant appreciation of the 
peso since June, intensified in recent weeks. Thus, CPI inflation will end the year at 2.4% 
and the CPIEFE at 1.9%, both below June's forecasts. Going forward, core inflation is 
expected to fluctuate around 2% until mid-2018, heavily influenced by the effects of the 
recent peso appreciation, to gradually return to 3% thereafter. Meanwhile, as fruits and 
vegetables prices resume a similar dynamic to that of their historical averages, the CPI 
will return to the target by the second half of 2018. As I mentioned, this trajectory is 
based on the RER depreciating slightly over the projection horizon (figure 10).  
 
5 
          As usual, a number of internal and external elements represent risks to these projections.  
Abroad, an ongoing concern is how the financial markets will respond to the monetary 
policy strategies of the main central banks of the developed world. After several years of 
highly expansionary monetary conditions, the economies have closed—or are on their 
way to close—their gaps and it is natural for monetary policy to begin to normalize, both 
in its more (rates) and less (balance sheet) conventional aspects. This entails risks because 
of the unprecedented timing and gradual pace of the process and its differences with 
market expectations.  
In the United States, there's also the doubts about fiscal management and its effects on 
growth, interest rates, and asset prices in general. Add the concerns about whether the 
recent  low  inflation  figures  in  several  developed  countries  are  one-time  or  rather 
systematic events, plus risks associated with recent geopolitical tensions. However, we 
cannot rule out that, given the good numbers of recent quarters, we see a faster recovery 
of developed economies. 
In the emerging world, the main source of risks continues to be the Chinese economy. 
Despite good first-half results and policies implemented, doubts persist about imbalances 
in a number of Chinese markets. There is also the uncertainty surrounding the path that 
the reforms agenda will take once the Chinese Communist Party Congress concludes. In 
Latin America, the landscape has not changed much and political risks remain the main 
source of uncertainty. 
The copper price  surpassed US$3 per pound at  the statistical  cutoff, but  the baseline 
scenario assumes that it will stand near US$2.75 during the next two years. Should the 
present price last, it would have positive effects on domestic activity and expenditure. At 
the same time, it could strengthen the peso and lower short-term inflation.  
The implications for monetary policy of such a scenario are not straightforward. Although 
in the short term inflation is reduced, the greater dynamism of the economy could imply 
a somewhat faster closure of the activity gap in the projection horizon. This crossroads, 
in a way, reminds us of the sharp peso depreciation between 2013 and 2015. In those 
days,  when  the  exchange  rate  accumulated  an  increase  of  around  45%,  annual  CPI 
inflation was above 4% for several quarters.  
At that time, monetary policy did not react to this increase in inflation by raising the 
MPR, understanding that it would have a significant but transitory effect on prices. In 
fact, what the economy needed was a greater monetary boost that would help offset the 
negative effects of the end of the commodity super-cycle and the weakness the economy 
had shown in recent years. In this sense, although the recent appreciation of the peso is 
an important development and will undoubtedly affect the evolution of inflation in the 
short  term,  as  reflected in the projections that I  have just  shown, its  implications for 
monetary policy are not evident as long as its direct or indirect effects do not imply that 
the convergence of inflation to the target in the policy horizon is compromised. 
 
6 
        About our domestic economy, the baseline scenario assumes that the factors that have 
reduced activity and inflation in recent months are transient. However, their persistence 
may be different than anticipated. On activity, a fraction of the lower growth responded 
to more persistent investment-related factors. This may be accentuated, for example, if 
confidence indicators regress. In any case, it cannot be ruled out that the economy may 
return  to  higher  growth  rates  faster  than  assumed  in  the  baseline  scenario.  This, 
considering that the labor market has not deteriorated any further, the cost of credit is low 
and  expectations  have  improved  somewhat,  which  could  lead  to  more  dynamic 
consumption. 
Inflation has fallen beyond forecasts and is now below 2%. Expectations at shorter terms 
are down from the cutoff date for the last Report, but at longer terms they show no major 
changes and remain anchored to the target. However, various factors may result in a 
sharper or longer-lasting drop, which could affect price formation over longer terms and 
inflation expectations. 
In this context, the Board estimates that the risk balance is unbiased for activity, and for 
inflation it is biased downward in the short term, but unbiased in the medium term.  
As a working assumption, our baseline scenario estimates a similar monetary impulse as 
in June, i.e., the MPR remaining fairly stable and beginning to move up towards neutral 
only after the economy starts closing the activity gap. Thus, monetary policy will remain 
expansionary through the entire projection horizon. As always, we will be watchful for 
any deviations from the baseline scenario that warrant moving the MPR. As I just said, 
in  the  short  run  inflationary  risks  are  biased  downwards.  If  it  happens,  it  may  affect 
convergence  to the  target,  in  which  case  monetary  policy will  need  to  be  even  more 
expansionary. 
New institutional developments and contributions 
Dear senators, I am submitting to you this, my first annual account as Governor of the 
Central  Bank.  I  head  an  institution  that  has  more  than  a  quarter  of  a  century  of 
autonomous  history  and  that,  over  this  time,  has  built  and  consolidated  a  technical 
reputation that has allowed for the correct performance of its functions, transforming it 
into an institutional reference in the public apparatus and in the group of central banks of 
emerging  countries.  This  has  occurred  to  a  large  extent  thanks  to  our  important 
contribution to the country's macroeconomic stability. 
Traveling this road has not been easy. At the outset, the mere idea of granting autonomy 
to the Bank cast a heavy blanket of doubt, not only because of the novelty of the scheme, 
but because it was difficult to dissociate its potential benefits in the fight against inflation 
from the political circumstances of its origin. However, the Bank's actions and its first 
monetary policy decisions made it possible to enhance the legitimacy of the Bank. This 
behavior  has  been  extended  and  deepened  over  time,  largely  on  the  initiative  of 
successive Central  Bank  boards.  The adjustments  to  the  monetary  policy  framework, 
increased  attention  to  issues  of  financial  stability,  efforts  to  improve  the  market 
 
7 
         orientation  of  its  policy  decisions  and  the  adoption,  by  its  own  initiative,  of  higher 
standards of transparency and accountability are expressions of this.  
Thus, the capital invested by the Bank in seriousness and commitment to the inflation 
target  and  financial  stability  has  contributed  enormously  to  provide  spaces  of 
independence to its monetary policy making. At the same time, the institutional autonomy 
of the Bank has not hindered dialogue and coordination with the Executive, through the 
Minister of Finance. Nor has this autonomy been translated into greater rigidity, but has 
provided an institutional arena within which it has been able to adapt, in a timely and 
flexible way, to new challenges, safeguarding the necessary independence to carry out its 
work. 
The  biggest  challenge  for  an  autonomous  institution  is  to  not  stay  behind  the  new 
demands  of  its  environment,  acting  with  timeliness  and  effectiveness  to  meet  its 
institutional  objectives  in  new  circumstances,  gaining  the  trust  of  the  public.  This 
confidence  is  far  from  being  a  sure  asset.  In  today's  ever-changing  world,  where 
confidence can be lost in a wink, we must work day after day to preserve it, especially 
considering the challenges that we face, both economically and socially. 
In  this  context  of  greater  transparency,  better  communication  and  contribution  to  the 
people's needs, I want to mention two elements that accompany this Report: a report on 
the determinants of the trend growth of the Chilean economy and a set of modifications 
to the monetary policy decision-making process. 
Determinants of the Chilean economy’s trend growth 
As I said a while ago, alongside this Report we have published a document summarizing 
a body of research that our technical teams have made on the determinants of long-term 
economic growth. Although these investigations date back many years, they have tended 
to  remain  at  an  academic  level.  However,  because  in  recent  years  our  economy  has 
slowed down quite significantly, it seemed to us on the Board that it would be appropriate 
to make an additional effort to consolidate our analysis, in an area that is not only key to 
adequately achieving the objectives mandated by the law, but also of general interest for 
the country. 
The document I am presenting today is the result of six months of review, updating and 
consolidation  work  of  many  studies  carried  out  at  the  Central  Bank,  combined  with 
incoming new empirical evidence that enrich our knowledge of the Chilean economy. It 
provides an in depth analysis of the medium-term trend growth of Chile in the horizon 
spanning from the years 2017 to 2050, with a special focus on the GDP growth projection 
for the next ten years.  
This document projects the evolution of the productive factors (labor and capital) and 
total factor productivity (TFP) for sectors other than natural resources, while for the latter, 
the  projection  of  its  expected  evolution  is  updated  in  the  light  of  diverse  sectoral 
background. It includes both the study of the history of the variables and a cross-country 
comparison, which allows us to look at the Chilean experience in the context of other 
 
8 
         countries that experienced our current levels of development before us, showing us what 
we can expect in the future. It also stresses the major importance of productivity, both in 
explaining  current  differences  in  income  levels  with  the  developed  world,  and  in 
projecting future growth. Therefore, special care is given to analyzing the evolution of 
TFP, providing new evidence on the importance of generating the proper conditions for 
an efficient allocation of resources. 
Primarily, we estimate that a range around 3% to 3.5% is reasonable to place trend GDP 
growth for the ten years ahead of us. This range for trend growth inputs the assumptions 
that natural resources sectors will grow around 2% on average, and the other sectors will 
grow near 3.4%.  
About this, estimates indicate that the increase in labor, understood in a broad sense, will 
contribute about 0.8% to growth in other sectors' GDP. Behind this estimate is the fact 
that improvements in human capital, the incorporation of women to the labor force and 
immigration will help compensate for the negative effect of the aging of the Chilean 
population and the tendency towards reducing the number of hours effectively worked 
that comes with development (figure 11). 
The projection assumes a relatively neutral role for capital, in the sense that it expands at 
the same rate as Other GDP. This assumption is consistent with the capital / product ratio 
remaining at levels close to its historical average, a stylized fact that is also present in 
other countries. For this, however, it is necessary for the investment rate to return to 
values consistent with potential growth. 
Finally, our projection assumes that the total factor productivity of other GDP will resume 
growth  around  its  average of the  last  twenty years,  an  important  but  clearly possible 
challenge.  Recovering  the  trend  growth  of  productivity  in  sectors  other  than  natural 
resources will be especially important, given the downward trend of natural resources, 
associated mainly with the fall in mineral ore. Indeed, the data show that, beyond the 
difficulty  of  calculating  productivity  by  sector,  the  negative  effect  of  the  decline  of 
mining ore has taking its toll on this industry (figure 12).   
The  evidence  from  Chile  suggests  that  there  are  important  inefficiencies  in  resource 
allocation across firms and that there would be first order gains from measures aimed at 
improving them, which, unlike the case of human capital, could generate gains sooner.  
To back this last analysis, the document provides some international comparisons on 
productivity, microeconomic evidence on how the productivity of firms evolves, and its 
degree  of  dispersion.  In  particular,  from  a  comparative  perspective,  although  Chile's 
productivity appears to be aligned with its GDP per capita, it is about 60% that of the 
United States and less than that of the richer OECD countries, which implies that there is 
great room for improvement (figure 13).  
In Chile, as in many other economies, there appear to be significant gains from fostering 
a better allocation of productive resources, helping the more efficient firms to grow and 
the less efficient to shrink and eventually exit the market. As can be seen in table 3, 
 
9 
         resource reallocation is an important source of TFP growth. For this, it is essential to have 
flexible labor markets that allow adjusting the endowment of companies when necessary, 
developing  the  financial  system  to  direct  resources  to  where  the  good  ideas  are  and 
implement rules that facilitate the creation and dissolution of companies. 
These figures are similar to those presented in previous years, reflecting that the Board 
has  not  changed  its  view  on  the  medium-term  productive  capacity  of  the  Chilean 
economy. However, we cannot ignore the fact that, because in recent years the growth 
rates  of  investment  and  productivity  have  been  below  their  trend  levels,  short-term 
productive capacity has suffered. Actually, the Board estimates that the potential growth 
of the economy is now around 2.5%, a little short of previous estimates. 
Adjustments to the monetary policy making process 
Another area where we are making progress is in the transparency and communication of 
our monetary policy decisions. The Bank conducts its monetary policy in an inflation 
targeting  framework,  which,  to  function  correctly  needs  to  properly  communicate  its 
actions and the reasons behind them, as well as a good diagnosis of the evolution of the 
economy,  locally  and  internationally.  The  adoption  of  these  decisions  and  their 
communication are structured around the Monetary Policy Meetings and the Monetary 
Policy  Report,  whose  organization,  priority,  content  and  dissemination  are  currently 
based on procedures and standards that were mostly established in the first half of the 
2000s. 
After a thorough internal assessment based on accumulated experience and international 
best practices, the Bank Board has decided to make some modifications to its monetary 
policy decision-making and communication process. 
Essentially, the number of Monetary Policy Meetings (MPM) is reduced from twelve to 
eight per year, to align them with the most common practice among the central banks of 
low-inflation countries (figure 14). In this new scheme, meetings will be held roughly 
every six to eight weeks, in January, March, May, June, August, September, October and 
December of each year. In addition, the meeting will be extended from one day to one 
day and a half, starting the afternoon before the day of the policy decision announcement, 
thus giving the Board more time to discuss the background information and analyze the 
monetary policy options.  
This will give more time to gather information between meetings and to evaluate the 
impact of the different economic indicators on the baseline scenario, allowing for a more 
robust analysis of the recent evolution of the economy.  
The communication and the minutes of the Meetings is also being changed, in the sense 
of backing the decision having more information at hand than we currently do. Thus, the 
press release will be extended to include the main antecedents of the recent behavior of 
the economy, the grounds on which the Board based the decision and the voting. The 
minutes, meanwhile, following a usual practice in inflation-targeting central banks, will 
 
10 
        provide additional information on the Board's discussion, which may be useful for the 
public to better understand its decisions and future implications.  
In addition, we have decided to publish the transcripts of the Monetary Policy Meetings 
with  a  ten-year  lag.  They  contain  information  of  the  topics  analyzed  and  opinions 
expressed  by  the  participants,  identifying  who  opined  what.  Disclosing  them  fulfills 
several  objectives.  On  the  one  hand,  it  further  strengthens  the  accountability  of  the 
decision-makers  and  increases  transparency  for  the  public.  On  the  other,  it  will  also 
contribute to the study of the country's economic history and a better understanding of 
the decisions made from a historical perspective. The publication of this material will be 
made  in  March  of  each  year.  The  measure  will  have  retroactive  effect,  so  that  the 
publication of March 2018 will cover the meetings of the years 2000 to 2007. 
Finally, we will also make changes to the publication periods of both our Monetary Policy 
Report and our Financial Stability Report. The Monetary Policy Report, which will keep 
its quarterly frequency, will be released first thing in the morning after the meetings of 
March, June, September and December, and will be complemented by a press conference 
of the CBC Governor at the Bank's premises. By publishing this Report the day after the 
Meeting, the Board will have the chance to reinforce the communication of the grounds 
that justify the policy decisions. In general, the vast majority of central banks publish 
their Reports or similar documents on the same day that monetary policy decisions are 
announced.  The  Monetary  Policy  Report  will  continue  to  be  submitted  to  the  Senate 
immediately after its publication, in dates that will be agreed upon with the respective 
instances. The Financial Stability Report, for its part, will continue to be published twice 
a year, but will now be made separately from the Monetary Policy Report, in May and 
November (table 4). 
The  two  Reports  will  now  more  actively  integrate  the  outcome  of  the  economic  and 
financial research work carried out by the Bank in matters of particular relevance to the 
institution's policy decisions. A first step in this direction is the document on trend growth 
attached to the present MP Report. 
All the changes I have described will become effective in January 2018. In addition, in 
September of each year we will publish the calendar with the dates of the Monetary Policy 
Meetings and the publication of the Reports of the next calendar year. For 2018, this 
calendar will be published next Thursday, September 14th. 
All these changes are part of the Bank's strategic plan and are intended to strengthen the 
current monetary policy framework, in order to reinforce compliance with the objective 
of  price  stability.  Moreover,  these  measures  are  the  product  of  a  thorough  internal 
evaluation  and  reflect both  the  Bank's  accumulated  experience  and  the  best  practices 
established at the international level.

         Concluding remarks 
With this presentation I hope to have shown how the Central Bank of Chile continues to 
fulfill the responsibilities assigned to it by the law, while progressing in its adaptation to 
new challenges and the need to maintain and enrich the trust of the citizens. 
The Bank has no agenda other than the functions and tasks entrusted, but these are enough 
to motivate a continuous effort of improvement that today takes special relevance. As I 
mentioned in my first presentation to the Finance Committee last December, this year we 
are carrying out a strategic planning exercise that will allow us to establish a framework 
for our institution’s development over the next five years. To prepare this exercise, we 
did widespread consultations, which included, among other things, close to a hundred 
interviews with corporate counterparties. I would like to thank the senators who answered 
our questions.  
A series of initiatives will come out from the strategic planning process that will help the 
Bank to strengthen and keep abreast of the new challenges facing our economy and our 
citizens  in  the  coming  years.  The  adjustments  to  the  monetary policy  process  I  have 
presented offer a peek into the Bank's Strategic Plan for 2018-2022, but I hope to be able 
to make a more complete presentation of it when I present our next MP Report to the 
Finance Committee in December. 
While the Chilean Central Bank strictly complies with its entrusted responsibilities, it 
also  works  to  take  on  the  challenges  of  tomorrow.  For  us,  institutional  autonomy 
represents a basis from which we can mobilize our resources to meet increasingly high 
standards of efficiency, efficacy and transparency. Just as many of today's practices have 
emerged from past Board agreements, we are working today to set the new standards 
against which we want to be evaluated in the future. Institutional autonomy should be 
seen as a factor that, rather than isolating the Bank from the rest of the country, makes it 
particularly responsible for being proactive in responding to its needs. What is important 
is for the Bank's response to the new challenges to be timely, well planned and effective, 
drawing on feedback, coordination and cooperation with other players. 
In this process the Senate plays a key role. It is through this Honorable House that we 
account for our management. Dialogue with the Senate is essential as feedback of our 
work and as a source of new challenges. The ongoing changes will add new opportunities 
to strengthen this link. In particular, the adjustments to the monetary policy process will 
transform the current presentation of the MP Report to the Finance Committee or to this 
plenary in a session where the senators will have more time to formulate their questions 
and comments. We expect, likewise, to develop mechanisms for a more comprehensive 
account of our management, covering all the issues under the responsibility of the Bank. 
My  sincere  thanks  for  your  attention  and  I  am  available  for  any  inquiries  that  the 
honorable senators may wish to make.
