Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy 
Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Nagoya 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
It is my great pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with a distinguished 
gathering of business leaders in the  Chubu region. I would like to take this opportunity to 
express my sincerest gratitude for your cooperation with the various activities of the Bank 
of Japan's Nagoya Branch. 
 At  the  Monetary  Policy  Meeting  (MPM)  held  last  week,  the  Bank  updated  its  projections 
for  Japan's  economic  activity  and  prices  through  fiscal  2019  and  released  them  in  the 
October 2017 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report). Today, I would 
like to talk about the Bank's outlook for Japan's economic activity and prices as well as its 
thinking behind the conduct of monetary policy, while outlining the Outlook Report. 
 I. The Current Situation of Japan's Economic Activity and Its Outlook 
Let  me  start  by  talking  about  economic  developments.  Japan's  economy  is  expanding 
moderately,  with  a  virtuous  cycle  from  income  to  spending  operating.  The  real  GDP  has 
continued to improve steadily; the output gap that shows the utilization of capital and labor 
exceeded  the  long-term average  of  0  percent  in  the  second  half  of  2016,  and  has  widened 
further  in  positive  territory  recently  (Chart  1).  In  the  Bank's  September  2017  Tankan 
(Short-Term  Economic  Survey  of  Enterprises  in  Japan),  the  diffusion  index  (DI)  for 
business conditions marked a high level last seen in 1991. 
 One of the  features of the current economic recovery  is the length of the recovery period. 
According to the government, the current recovery phase, which started in December 2012, 
is  highly  likely  to  have  lasted  for  58  consecutive  months  by  September  this  year.  This 
represents the second longest period of economic recovery in the post-war era, longer than 
the  Izanagi  Boom  in  the  second  half  of  the  1960s.  During  the  course  of  the  recovery,  in 
around  2015,  for  example,  Japan's  exports  temporarily  turned  to  a  decline  against  the 
background  of  a  slowdown  in  emerging  economies.  For  the  past  year  or  so,  however,  the 
economic recovery  has taken hold more firmly.  Furthermore, I think that the recovery has 
become more sustainable for the following three reasons. 
  1 
The  first  reason  is  that  the  global  economy  has  continued  to  improve  in  a  well-balanced 
manner. Both the advanced and emerging economies have continued to improve, supporting 
Japan's economic expansion. The positive effects of the recovery in the world trade volume 
are spreading across the world, including to Japan. In the World Economic Outlook (WEO) 
released  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  last  month,  growth  projections  have 
continued to be revised upward for many countries and regions, and the global economy is 
expected to continue its firm growth, with the real GDP growth rate rising from 3.2 percent 
in 2016 to 3.6 percent in 2017 and 3.7 percent in 2018 (Chart 2). Last month, I attended a 
number  of  international  meetings,  including  the  Group  of  Twenty  (G-20)  meeting  held  in 
Washington  D.C.,  and  it  was  striking  that  many  participants  referred  to  "synchronous 
growth" of the global economy. 
 The  second  reason  is  that  Japan's  economic  growth  has  been  led  by  both  external  and 
domestic demand in a well-balanced manner. Japan's exports have increased -- mainly led 
by  automobile-related  and  IT-related  exports  --  on  the  back  of  the  growth  in  overseas 
economies.  In  addition  to  such  strong  external  demand,  domestic  demand  has  been  on  an 
increasing trend. Specifically, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing 
trend,  while  corporate  profits  have  marked  record  high  levels  (Chart  3).  Private 
consumption  has  increased  its  resilience,  supported  by  steady  improvement  in  the 
employment and income situation as well as replacement demand for durable goods. Public 
investment  also  has  been  increasing  clearly  since  the  turn  of  the  fiscal  year.  These 
developments  show  that  the  current  economic  expansion  is  not  relying  on  a  single  factor, 
but rather is supported by multiple factors. Therefore, the Bank views that the expansion is 
quite sustainable. 
 The  third  reason  is  that  the  effects  of  economic  expansion  have  been  spreading  to  a  wide 
range  of  economic  entities.  The  business  conditions  DI  in  the  Tankan  has  continued  to  be 
positive in recent quarters, even in small firms and nonmanufacturing firms. This is clearly 
different  from  the  recovery  phase  in  the  mid-2000s,  in  which the  DI  improved  mainly  for 
large firms and manufacturing firms (Chart 4). Looking at developments by region, the DI 
has been positive for all regions since the December 2013 survey. In addition, in the Bank's 
October  2017  Regional  Economic  Report,  all  nine  regions  across  the  country  showed 
 2 
positive economic assessments, using phrases such as moderate recovery and expansion. Of 
the nine regions, the Tokai region  has been the frontrunner of economic expansion. In the 
latest  Regional  Economic  Report,  the  Bank's  Nagoya  Branch  revised  its  economic 
assessment  of  the  Tokai  region  upward  to  one  stating  that  the  economy  "has  been 
expanding"  from  the  previous  one  stating  that  it  "has  been  expanding  moderately."  The 
Tokai region is the only region that assesses the economy as having been expanding. As the 
region is one of the largest manufacturing centers in Japan, it has benefitted from the global 
economic recovery and stable exchange rates. However, these factors alone cannot explain 
its  recent  strong  growth.  I  feel  that  your  various  management  efforts,  including  strategic 
investment  for  future  development,  have  paid  off  and  led  to  the  strength  in  this  region's 
economy. 
 As  I  have  explained  so  far,  in  Japan's  current  economic  recovery,  both  external  and 
domestic  demand  have  been  increasing  in  a  well-balanced  manner,  and  the  effects  of 
economic  expansion  have  been  spreading  to  a  wide  range  of  economic  entities,  with 
overseas economies continuing to grow at a moderate pace. Under the circumstances, labor 
market  conditions  have  tightened  further.  The  active  job  openings-to-applicants  ratio  has 
continued to rise, marking 1.52 for September and reaching a level seen in 1974 (Chart 5). 
The unemployment rate has declined to the range of 2.5-3.0 percent, which is equivalent to 
virtually  full  employment.  Against  the  background  of  such  tightening  of  labor  market 
conditions, wages have risen moderately, mainly for part-time employees. 
 Next, I would like to talk about the outlook for Japan's economic activity. The Bank projects 
that  Japan's  economy  is  likely  to  continue  its  moderate  expansion  on  the  back  of  highly 
accommodative financial conditions and the effects of the government's large-scale stimulus 
measures, with overseas economies continuing to grow at a moderate pace. In the October 
Outlook  Report,  the  medians  of  the  Policy  Board  members'  forecasts  of  the  real  GDP 
growth rates for fiscal 2017 and 2018 are 1.9 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively (Chart 6). 
These figures are above Japan's potential growth rate, which is estimated to be in the range 
of  0.5-1.0  percent.  In  fiscal  2019,  although  the  growth  pace  is  projected  to decelerate,  the 
economy is expected to continue expanding, underpinned by the increase in exports on the 
 3 
back of the growth in overseas economies, and the median of the forecasts of the real GDP 
growth rate is 0.7 percent. 
 There are, of course, upside and downside risks to this baseline scenario of the outlook for 
Japan's  economic activity.  The  biggest  risk  factor  is  developments  in  overseas  economies. 
As  I  have  explained,  overseas  economies  are  expected  to  continue  growing  at  a  moderate 
pace, but the U.S. economic policies and their impact on global financial markets warrant 
attention.  Risks  also 
include 
those  concerning  developments 
in  emerging  and 
commodity-exporting  economies  as  well  as  geopolitical  issues.  If  these  risks  were  to 
materialize, they could exert downward pressure on economic activity. On the other hand, 
we  also  should  keep  in  mind  that,  given  that  market  participants  and  economic  entities 
already factor these risks in to a certain extent, the economy could deviate upward from the 
baseline  scenario  depending  on  how  they  play  out.  The  Bank  assesses  that  upside  and 
downside  risks  to  economic  activity  are  generally  balanced,  but  will  examine  both  risks 
thoroughly. 
 II. Price Developments and their Outlook 
Now I will move to price developments. The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer 
price index (CPI) excluding fresh food has risen somewhat, reflecting an increase in energy 
prices, and has been in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent (Chart 7). The rate of change in the CPI 
excluding  fresh  food  and  energy,  however,  has  remained  slightly  positive  despite  the 
economic  expansion  and  the  tightening  of  labor  market  conditions.  While  this  is  partly 
attributable to temporary factors, including a reduction in mobile-phone related prices, this 
also reflects the fact that a wide range of firms have been making efforts to absorb a rise in 
wage  costs  by  increasing  labor-saving  investment  and  streamlining  their  business  process. 
As just described, price developments have remained relatively weak, but the Bank projects 
that  the  year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  CPI  is  likely  to  continue  on  an  uptrend  and 
increase toward the price stability target of 2 percent. 
 Specifically, the following mechanism is assumed. First, prices of items such as processed 
food and daily necessities -- which are responsive to economic activity  -- are likely to rise 
gradually as private consumption improves moderately, and the yen's depreciation as well as 
 4 
the pick-up in crude oil prices to date are expected to push up import prices. Second, as the 
economy continues to expand moderately and the output gap improves further, firms' stance 
is  likely  to  gradually  shift  toward  raising  wages  and  prices,  and  the  inflation  rate  is 
projected  to  rise  in  line  with  wage  increases.  Third,  with  these  factors  pushing  up  actual 
inflation, a virtuous cycle is expected to operate in which people's inflation expectations rise 
accordingly,  leading  to  a  further  increase  in  actual  inflation.  Bearing  this  mechanism  in 
mind,  the  October  Outlook  Report  shows  that  the  medians  of  the  Policy  Board  members' 
forecasts of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh food are 0.8 percent 
for  fiscal  2017,  1.4  percent  for  fiscal  2018,  and  on  a  basis  excluding  the  effects  of  the 
consumption tax hike, 1.8 percent for fiscal 2019 (Chart 6). 
 Firms' price-setting stance going forward is the key to the Bank's outlook for prices. Firms 
that  have  faced  a  rise  in  labor  costs  due  to  tight  labor  market  conditions  are  likely  to 
consider passing on a rise in wage costs to prices of their products and services. At the same 
time, they often try to absorb the rise in wage costs and keep their prices unchanged mainly 
through  labor-saving  and  efficiency-improving  investment  that  makes  use  of  information 
technology. In fact, software investment plans of small firms for fiscal 2017 have marked a 
significant increase of more than 20 percent on a year-on-year basis (Chart 8). In addition, 
many  firms  lately  are  trying  to  absorb  the  rise  in  wage  costs  by  streamlining  the  existing 
business process. In other words, they are making efforts to reduce services for which labor 
costs  are  too  high  to  make  profits.  These  firms'  efforts  make  it  possible  to  restrain  an 
increase in total labor costs even if hourly wages of employees rise, thereby containing the 
passing  on  of  those  costs  to  product  prices.  While  these  efforts  are  based  on  individual 
firms'  reasonable  business  strategy  with  a  view  to  raising  productivity,  on  the  price  front, 
they would reduce the upward pressure on prices at least in the short run. 
 However,  the  Bank  does  not  expect  that  this  situation  will  last  for  a  long  time.  Rather,  it 
assesses  that  upward  pressure  on  prices  has  been  increasing  gradually.  I  would  like  to 
highlight  the  following  three  points  as  the  recent  change  in  the  environment  surrounding 
prices. 
  5 
First, labor market conditions have tightened significantly, with the annual rate of increase 
in hourly wages of part-time employees reaching around 2.5 percent; as a result, the upward 
pressure  of  the  rise  in  firms'  costs  on  prices  has  been  increasing  steadily.  Under  such 
circumstances,  in  parallel  with  the  aforementioned  efforts  to  streamline  their  business 
process, an increasing number of firms have been working on passing on the increased costs 
that they cannot absorb to their sales prices (Chart 9). In the transportation industry, where 
labor shortage is acute, one of the major companies announced this spring that it planned to 
raise  the  prices  of  its  home  delivery  services,  and  competitors  followed  suit.  This  episode 
suggests  that  upward  pressure  on  prices  stemming  from  the  rise  in  wage  costs  has  been 
mounting. 
 Second,  consumers'  and  customers'  perception  of  price  rises  has  been  changing.  As  the 
employment  and  income  situation  in  the  household  sector  has  improved,  it  seems  that 
consumers are gradually accepting price rises. Recently, it is reported more frequently that 
some firms in the restaurant business, for example, decided to raise prices for the first time 
in a while. It looks as though firms that had been hesitant to raise prices for many years are 
encouraged by the increase in consumers' appetite for spending. 
 Third,  it  appears  that  investors  have  started  to  consider  the  recent  price  rises  as  positive 
developments. Among budget chain restaurants listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, there 
have  been  some  cases  where  the  announcement  of  price  rises  was  received  positively  and 
stock  prices  increased  sharply.  I  feel  it  was  often  the  case  in  the  past  that  investors  were 
rather concerned about the declines in the number of customers and sales as a result of price 
rises. Recently, however, it seems that investors are expecting an increase in profits instead. 
Amid  changes  in  firms'  price-setting  stance  and  in  consumers'  perception  of  price  rises,  it 
appears that investors are starting to appreciate these developments. 
 Indeed, the specific timing at which each firm's stance shifts toward raising prices is likely 
to vary, depending on developments in demand that each firm and industry faces or on the 
extent  of  the  rise  in  wage  costs.  In  this  regard,  there  is  a  risk  that  a  rise  in  inflation 
expectations  will  lag  behind  if  it  takes  time  for  firms' stance to  shift  toward  raising  prices 
and  price  developments  remain  relatively  weak.  However,  the  Tokai  region  --  the 
 6 
frontrunner  of  Japan's  economic  expansion  --  has  shown  a  rise  in  the  active  job 
openings-to-applicants ratio to 1.8,  indicating that the  region's labor market conditions are 
much tighter than those of the national average. I believe that  a favorable environment has 
been  put  in  place  in  which  wage  increases  stimulate  consumers'  appetite  for  spending, 
leading to firms' bullish price-setting stance. 
 III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy 
Next,  I  will  talk  about  the  Bank's  conduct  of  monetary  policy.  The  Bank  has  been 
conducting  "Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Monetary  Easing  (QQE)  with  Yield  Curve 
Control"  with  the  aim  of  achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent.  This  framework 
consists of two components (Chart 10). 
 The  first  is  an  inflation-overshooting  commitment.  This  is  a  strong  commitment  that  the 
Bank will continue expanding the monetary base until the  year-on-year rate of increase in 
the actual CPI exceeds 2 percent and stays above that level in a stable manner. It is crucial 
that  people  actually  experience  inflation  above  2  percent  and thereby  the  perception  takes 
hold  among  them  that  prices  of  goods  and  services  tend  to  go  up  every  year  by  around  2 
percent.  With  this  in  mind,  the  Bank  has  committed  itself  to  continuing  with  large-scale 
monetary easing until such situation is achieved. 
 The second component is yield curve control. The Bank continuously conducts purchases of 
Japanese  government  bonds  (JGBs)  to  facilitate  the  formation  of  the  yield  curve  that  is 
considered  most  appropriate  for  achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent  at  the 
earliest possible time. Under this framework, the yield curve has been formed smoothly in a 
manner consistent with the  current guideline for market operations in which the Bank sets 
the  short-term  policy  interest  rate  at  minus  0.1  percent  and  the  target  level  of  the  10-year 
JGB yields at around zero percent. 
 Under  the  Bank's  yield  curve  control,  JGB  yields  --  which  are  the  base  interest  rates  in 
Japan -- have been stable at low levels; as a result,  bank lending rates as well as issuance 
rates for CP and corporate bonds -- to which certain spreads are added in both cases -- also 
have remained at extremely low levels (Chart 11). The amount outstanding of bank lending, 
 7 
as  well  as  of  CP  and  corporate  bonds,  has  been  increasing  firmly.  These  developments 
suggest that the current highly accommodative financial conditions, brought about by yield 
curve  control,  have  been  strongly  supporting  Japan's  economic  activity  from  the  financial 
side. 
 As  described  in  the  October  Outlook  Report,  the  Bank  is  also  aware  that  prolonged 
downward  pressure  on  financial  institutions'  profits  under  the  continued  low  interest  rate 
environment  could  create  risks  of  a  gradual  pullback  in  financial  intermediation.  At  this 
point,  this  risk  is  judged  as  not  significant,  mainly  because  financial  institutions  have 
sufficient  capital  bases;  however,  the  Bank  will  keep  closely  monitoring  the  effects  of  the 
continued low interest rate environment on the functioning of financial intermediation. 
 As  I  mentioned  today,  price  developments  in  Japan  have  been  relatively  weak  compared 
with the improvement in economic activity, and there is still a long way to go to achieve the 
price  stability  target  of  2  percent.  Going  forward,  however,  firms'  stance  is  likely  to 
gradually shift toward raising wages and prices with the further improvement in the output 
gap.  People's  medium-  to  long-term  inflation  expectations  are  projected  to  rise  steadily  as 
further price rises come to be observed widely. With these positive developments persisting, 
the  Bank  will  steadily  proceed  toward  achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent. 
Under the current framework of "QQE with Yield Curve Control," the Bank will continue to 
persistently pursue powerful monetary easing. 
 Conclusion 
Lastly,  I  would  like  to  once  again  touch  upon  the  economy  of  the  Tokai  region.  As  I 
mentioned earlier, the region is the frontrunner of economic expansion in Japan. One of the 
driving  forces  of  such  strong  growth  is  that  firms  are  expected  to  continue  making  fixed 
investment  --  such  as  in  next-generation  cars  and  related  to  maglev  trains  --  from  a 
long-term  perspective.  I  feel  that  the  mindset  of  firms  in  this  region  is  always 
future-oriented, while also taking the present situation into account. With respect to  future 
development,  there are  some  challenges  ahead  for  the  region.  These  include  (1)  what  will 
happen and  what  will  become  possible  when,  after a  decade,  a maglev  train links  the  two 
major economies -- Tokyo and Nagoya -- in 40 minutes, (2) what the relationship between 
 8 
people and cars will be after two decades, and (3) how to make the most of firms' expertise, 
where  Japan's  advantage  lies,  as  global  manufacturing  shifts  toward  standardizing 
production  as  well  as  deploying  the  "Internet  of  Things  (IoT)."  As  is  the  case  to  date,  I 
believe that you will find solutions to these challenges through persistent efforts. Needless 
to  say,  the  biggest  challenge  is  how  individual  firms  and  Japan's  economy  continue  to 
achieve  sustainable  growth  amid  a  decline  in  population.  Not  much  time  is  left  until  the 
baby-boomer generation fully retires. These challenges are not easy to tackle, but we have 
to  solve  all  of  them  simultaneously.  I  would  like  to  close  my  speech  by  making  a 
commitment  that  the  Bank  will  firmly  support  Japan's  economy  by  persistently  pursuing 
powerful monetary easing, while trusting that the Tokai region will accumulate the wisdom 
and technology to address these challenges. Thank you for your attention.
