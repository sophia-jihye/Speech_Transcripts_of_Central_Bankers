Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy 
Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Osaka 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
It is my great pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with a distinguished 
gathering of business leaders in the Kansai  region. I would like to take this opportunity to 
express my sincerest gratitude for your cooperation with the various activities of the Bank 
of Japan's branches in Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto. 
 In  my  speech  today,  I  would  like  to  first  talk  about  the  Bank's  view  on  the  recent 
developments  in  economic  activity  and  prices,  and  then  explain  its  thinking  behind  the 
conduct of monetary policy. 
 I. Economic Developments 
Let  me  start  by  talking  about  economic  developments.  Japan's  economy  is  expanding 
moderately, with  a  virtuous  cycle  from  income  to  spending  being  maintained  in  both  the 
corporate and household sectors. Although the real GDP growth rate for the January-March 
quarter  temporarily  marked  negative  growth,  due  mainly  to  irregular  weather,  after 
continuing  to  register  positive  growth  for  eight  consecutive  quarters,  the  rate  for  the 
April-June  quarter  showed  a  return  to  firm  growth,  representing  3.0  percent  on  an 
annualized basis (Chart 1). 
 The  long-lasting  recovery  of  Japan's  economy  is  likely  to  be  mainly  attributable  to  both 
external  and  domestic  demand  increasing  in  a  well-balanced  manner.  As  for  external 
demand,  exports  have  continued  on  an  increasing  trend,  exceeding  the  peak  before  the 
global financial crisis, led mainly by those of capital goods and IT-related goods, in which 
Japan  has  a  comparative  advantage  (Chart  2).  Looking  at  the  underlying  developments  in 
overseas  economies  in  detail,  the  U.S.  economy  has  continued  to  expand  firmly,  with  the 
growth rate for the April-June quarter registering 4 percent on an annualized basis.  Firms' 
sentiment  has  continued  to  improve  in  both  the  manufacturing  and  nonmanufacturing 
sectors, and there has been  positive momentum in private consumption on the back of the 
favorable  employment  and  income  situation.  Meanwhile,  the  European  economy  has 
continued to recover on the whole with business fixed investment and private consumption 
following an uptrend; however, exports recently have decelerated somewhat, due mainly to 
the  effects  of  the  appreciation  of  the  euro.  As  for  emerging  economies,  the  Chinese 
 1 
economy  has  continued  to  see  stable  growth  on  the  whole  with  private  investment  and 
consumption remaining firm, although growth in infrastructure investment has decelerated 
somewhat.  Other  emerging  economies,  mainly  Asian  economies,  have  been  recovering 
moderately,  reflecting  in  part  an  increase  in  exports  and  the  effects  of  their  economic 
stimulus measures. Thus, while the momentum of economic recovery differs to some extent 
across  countries  and  regions,  the  Bank  judges  that  overseas  economies  have  continued  to 
grow firmly on the whole. 
 Turning  to  the  domestic  situation,  in  the  corporate  sector,  the  profit  environment  has 
remained  favorable,  with  the  ratio  of  current  profits  to  sales  having  been  at  a  record  high 
level  (Chart  3).  Under  these  circumstances,  according  to  the  Bank's  June  Tankan 
(Short-Term  Economic  Survey  of  Enterprises  in  Japan),  firms'  business  fixed  investment 
plans  for  fiscal  2018  showed  the  highest  growth  for  this  time  of  the  year  since the  survey 
started.  In  the  manufacturing  sector,  there  has  been  a  notable  increase  in  research  and 
development  investment  with  a  view  to  advancing  next-generation  technology  such  as 
self-driving  systems  and  large-capacity  batteries,  in  addition  to  investment  intended  for 
capacity  expansion  on  the  back  of  firm  domestic  and  external  demand.  In  the 
nonmanufacturing  sector,  investment  aimed  at  improving  efficiency  and  saving  labor  in 
order  to  deal  with  the  recent  labor  shortage  has  maintained  its  high  growth.  Such 
improvement in the corporate sector has had positive effects on the household sector. In the 
labor market, the active job openings-to-applicants ratio is currently 1.63, the high level last 
seen during the period of high economic growth, and the unemployment rate has declined to 
around 2.5 percent, the level observed during the bubble period (Chart 4). While the number 
of  employees  has  registered  a  year-on-year  growth  rate  of  around  2  percent,  total  cash 
earnings per employee have risen moderately but steadily, led mainly by those of part-time 
employees.  Against  the  background  of  such  improvement  in  the  employment  and  income 
situation, private consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations. 
 In terms of the contribution to economic growth, the recent increase in demand from foreign 
visitors cannot be ignored. Sales of duty free goods at department stores in the first half of 
this  year  registered  an  annual  increase  of  close  to  50  percent,  and  the  occupancy  rates  of 
city hotels  have maintained the high level of almost 80 percent  for the past few  years. On 
 2 
this point, as big events such as the Rugby World Cup and the G-20 summit are scheduled 
to be held in Osaka next year,  I hear that the construction of new hotels  and rebuilding of 
existing facilities have been taking place successively. As for the typhoon at the beginning 
of September, the Bank will make efforts to firmly grasp the impact of the damage caused, 
and  expects  that  both  the  public  and  private  sectors  will  work  together  to  overcome  the 
disaster and create regions that are even stronger and more attractive. 
 So  far,  I  have  explained  that  Japan's  economy  has  been  improving,  led  by  external  and 
domestic  demand  in  a  well-balanced  manner.  With  regard  to  the  outlook,  the  economy  is 
likely to continue its moderate expansion. However, there are various risks to this baseline 
scenario,  and  uncertainties  regarding  overseas  economies  in  particular  warrant  attention. 
For example, it is necessary to thoroughly examine the extent to which recent protectionist 
moves, such as the trade friction between the United States and China, will affect trade as 
well  as  firms'  investment  activities.  There  have  been  active  discussions  over  this  issue  at 
international conferences that I have taken part in, including the G-20 and G-7 meetings. In 
addition, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently  released a simulation analysis of 
the  effects  of  protectionist  moves  on  the  global  economy.  According  to  the  simulation, 
downward pressure on the global economy stemming from stagnation in trade activity itself 
is  likely  to  be  0.1  percentage  point  at  most  in  the  next  five  years.  However,  if  such 
protectionist  moves  bring  about  turmoil  in  global  financial  markets  and  deterioration  in 
firms'  sentiment,  downward  pressure  on  the  global  economy  is  expected  to  be  around  0.5 
percentage  point  at  most.  Global  economies  have  become  more  interdependent  than  ever 
before,  with  the  recent  progress  in  globalization  and  information  technology.  In  this 
situation,  it  is  clear  that  protectionist  policies  will  not  benefit  any  economy,  regardless  of 
whether it adopts such policies. Therefore, while a brake is expected to be put on excessive 
protectionist moves at some point, it is essential to continue global discussion to ensure this 
and to make sure that protectionist moves will not create instability in financial markets and 
firms' sentiment. 
 Moreover,  attention  also  should  be  paid  to  the  effects  that  moves  toward  monetary  policy 
normalization,  including  the  policy  rate  hikes  in  the  United  States,  will  have  on  global 
capital  flows  and  emerging  economies.  In  fact,  some  emerging  economies  such  as Turkey 
 3 
and Argentina -- where there are vulnerabilities in the economy including twin deficits and 
high  inflation  --  are  confronted  with  a  significant  depreciation  of  their  currencies,  as  the 
inflow of dollar-based capital into these economies has turned to an outflow. That said, the 
fundamentals  of  many  other  emerging  economies  including  Asian  economies  have  been 
firm, and the Federal Reserve seems to be conducting its policy by carefully taking account 
of  developments  in  global  financial  markets  and  the  global  economy.  Thus,  it  is  fairly 
unlikely at this point that the problems happening in some emerging economies will spread 
widely. However, as sudden changes could arise in the market, we will continue to carefully 
examine developments in global financial markets and emerging economies. 
 II. Price Developments 
Now I will move on to price developments. Prices have continued to show relatively weak 
developments compared to the economic expansion and the labor market tightening, and the 
year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  consumer  price  index  (CPI)  excluding  fresh  food  and 
energy  prices  has  been  in  the  range  of  0.0-0.5  percent  (Chart  5).  After  five  years,  Japan's 
economy  is  no  longer  in  deflation,  in  the  sense  of  a  sustained  decline  in  prices,  but  the 
Bank's  price  stability  target  of  2  percent  inflation  on  an  annual  basis  has  not  yet  been 
achieved. For this reason, in the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report) 
released  at  the  end  of  July,  the  Bank  focused  on  examining  the  reasons  for  these  sluggish 
price  developments  and  updated  the  outlook  for  economic  activity  and  prices.  Today,  I 
would like to outline some key points of the report. 
 The  first  point  is  the  reason  why  prices  have  been sluggish  even  though  the economy  has 
improved  steadily.  Basically,  this  is  likely  to  be  mainly  attributable  to  the  experience  of 
prolonged low growth and deflation. The long and severe adjustment phase since the second 
half  of  the  1990s,  including  the  financial  crisis,  brought  about  sluggishness  in  economic 
activity  and  asset  prices.  Under  these circumstances,  firms' wage-  and  price-setting  stance 
as well as households' views toward price rises have become cautious. The Bank introduced 
quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary  easing  (QQE)  in  2013  and  has  been  persistently 
conducting powerful monetary easing. However, as the mindset and behavior based on the 
assumption  that  wages  and  prices  will  not  increase  easily  have  become  embedded  in  the 
economy over a long period of time, it has been taking time for the situation to change. 
 4 
In  addition  to  such  basic  factors,  the  large  room  to  raise  productivity,  mainly  in  the 
nonmanufacturing  sector,  as  well  as  the  technological  progress  such  as  digitalization  in 
recent  years,  have  allowed  firms  to  maintain  their  cautious  stance  toward  raising  prices 
despite an increase in labor costs. For instance, many firms in the accommodations as well 
as  eating  and  drinking  services  sectors  have  been  compensating  for  a  rise  in  personnel 
expenses  by  introducing  online  reservation  and  ordering  systems  using  tablet  devices.  In 
addition,  a  further  increase  in  labor  participation  by  women  and  seniors  in  the  past  few 
years  has  eased  labor  shortage  in  part,  serving  as  a  factor  slowing  the  pace  of  wage 
increases.  In  the  long  term,  such  moves  are  likely  to  strengthen  the  economy's  growth 
potential  and  make  firms'  and  households'  spending  activities  more  active,  thereby 
contributing  to  pushing  up  prices.  At  least  in  the  short  term,  however,  these  moves  will 
weaken upward pressure on wages and prices due to the reasons I mentioned earlier. 
 The  second  point  concerning  prices  in  Japan  is  that  the  mechanism  for  a  rise  in  inflation 
itself  is  not  lost,  although  its  pace  is  sluggish.  Moves  to  raise  sales  prices  have  been 
observed recently among a wide range of firms, reflecting rises in personnel expenses and 
prices of raw materials as well as components. Also,  according to the Tankan, for the first 
time in about 10 years, the number of enterprises answering that the output prices have risen 
has  been  exceeding  the  number  of  those  answering  that  such  prices  have  fallen  (Chart  6). 
Going  forward,  with  the  heightening  perception  of  labor  shortage,  as  wages  of  part-time 
employees  continue  to  increase,  its  effects  are  likely  to  spread  to  wages  of  regular 
employees,  mainly  among  small  and  medium-sized  firms  and  the  younger  generations.  In 
fact, at this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, the rise in the rate of 
increase  in  base  pay  was  more  evident  for  small  and  medium-sized  firms  than  for  large 
firms,  and  summer  bonuses  increased  more  significantly  than  last  year.  Such  moves  are 
expected to ease consumers' cost-saving mentality and price rises by firms are likely to be 
more easily accepted accordingly. 
 In this way, as a high level of utilization of labor and capital, or an improved output gap, is 
sustained,  many  of  the  factors  that  have  been  delaying  inflation  --  such  as  firms'  cautious 
wage- and price-setting stance as well as households' cautiousness toward price rises -- will 
likely be resolved gradually. When further price rises come to be observed widely as a result 
 5 
of this, people's medium- to long-term inflation expectations are projected to rise gradually. 
As a consequence, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually 
toward the price stability target of 2 percent, although it will take more time than expected. 
In the July Outlook Report, the Bank projected that the year-on-year rates of change in the 
CPI  (less  fresh  food)  for  fiscal  2018  through  fiscal  2020  would  likely  be  1.1  percent,  1.5 
percent, and 1.6 percent, respectively. We are in a difficult situation in terms of achieving 2 
percent inflation by fiscal 2020. Nevertheless, maintaining a positive output gap -- a driver 
for a rise in inflation -- for a long time, which will firmly push up actual prices as well as 
inflation  expectations,  as  I  just  mentioned,  is  likely  to  be  the  most  certain  path  toward 
achieving 2 percent inflation. 
 III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy 
Lastly, I would like to talk about the Bank's thinking behind the conduct of monetary policy. 
 The  Bank  has  been  conducting  powerful  monetary  easing  under  the  framework  of  "QQE 
with Yield Curve Control," aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent (Chart 7). 
In terms of yield curve control, with a view to facilitating the formation of the yield curve 
that  is  considered  most  appropriate  for  achieving  2  percent  inflation,  the  Bank  has 
purchased Japanese government bonds (JGBs) under the guideline for market operations, in 
which it sets the short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the target level of 
10-year JGB yields at around zero percent. Under the circumstances, not only JGB yields, 
but also lending rates for firms as well as issuance rates for corporate bonds have remained 
at extremely low levels, and the amount outstanding of bank lending has been increasing. In 
addition,  the  Bank  has  purchased  exchange-traded  funds  (ETFs)  so  that  their  amount 
outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 6 trillion yen,  with a view to lowering 
risk  premia  in  the  stock  market  and  exerting  positive  effects  on  economic  activity  and 
prices. 
 As  I  mentioned  earlier,  it  is  likely  to  take  more  time  than  expected  to  achieve  2  percent 
inflation.  On  the  other  hand,  the  mechanism  whereby  an  improvement  in  the  output  gap 
leads  to  a  rise  in  inflation  has  continued  to  operate.  Considering  such  situation,  the  Bank 
judged it important to persistently continue with powerful monetary easing and decided at 
 6 
the  July  2018  Monetary  Policy  Meeting  (MPM)  to  strengthen  the  policy  framework  as 
follows (Chart 8). 
 First, the Bank introduced forward guidance for policy rates. Specifically, it publicly made 
clear to "maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for 
an  extended  period  of  time,  taking  into  account  uncertainties  regarding  economic  activity 
and  prices  including  the  effects  of  the  consumption  tax  hike  scheduled  to  take  place  in 
October  2019."  This  is  based  on  the  recognition  that,  in  a  situation  where  achieving  2 
percent  inflation  is  taking  time,  simply  stating  that  it  will  persistently  continue  with 
monetary easing cannot sufficiently ensure public confidence regarding its monetary policy. 
I  hope  the  introduction  of  forward  guidance  makes  clear  the  Bank's  strong  policy  stance 
toward achieving the price stability target. 
 With regard to this forward guidance, some point out that it is difficult to understand how 
long "for an extended period of time" means. First of all, as the words imply, it is not based 
on a specific period of time. The phrase "for an extended period of time" was often used by 
other central banks, presumably implying a fairly long period of time. Partly because central 
banks in the United States and Europe are proceeding with monetary policy normalization 
recently, some market participants speculated that a policy rate hike would take place soon 
even  in  Japan.  However,  the  situation  regarding  the  price  stability  target  in  Japan  differs 
substantially from that in the United States and Europe. In terms of clarifying this point, it is 
very important to make clear that the Bank will maintain the current extremely low levels of 
short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time. 
 Of  course,  "for  an  extended  period  of  time"  does  not  mean  permanently.  Such  being  the 
case, some may think that the period for which interest rate levels will be maintained should 
be linked to a specific period of time or price indicators, in order to ensure the effectiveness 
of  the  commitment.  However,  there  are  various  uncertainties  regarding  economic  activity 
and  prices  in  Japan,  as  I  mentioned  earlier.  Therefore,  in  designing  forward  guidance,  we 
need to ensure not only the effectiveness of the commitment, but also the flexibility of the 
future policy conduct, and in a balanced manner. The same applies to forward guidance by 
other central banks. That is, in the initial stage following its introduction, as is the case in 
 7 
Japan,  it  is  common  to  commit  to  maintaining  interest  rate  levels  while  presenting 
qualitative conditions such as the economic situation and risk assessments, focusing  rather 
on the flexibility of the policy conduct. 
 In addition to the introduction of forward guidance, the Bank decided at the July MPM to 
enhance  the  sustainability  of  "QQE  with  Yield  Curve  Control."  In  persistently  continuing 
with monetary easing, it is necessary to make adjustments to the policy framework so that it 
can function in a competent manner over the period of the easing's duration. For example, 
while the current target level of 10-year JGB yields is around zero percent, as I mentioned 
earlier,  the  Bank  made  it  clear  that,  under  the  target,  the  long-term  yields  might  move 
upward  and  downward  to  some  extent  mainly  depending  on  developments  in  economic 
activity and prices, thereby conducting market operations in a more flexible manner. Yield 
curve control is an essential measure in stabilizing interest rates in Japan at low levels. On 
the  other  hand,  because it  is  powerful, interest  rate formation  in the  JGB  market  has  been 
somewhat  rigid,  and  there  has  been  a  notable  decline  in  transactions.  It  is  considered  that 
the  measures  decided  at  the  July  MPM  will  mitigate  the  side  effects  accompanying  such 
powerful monetary easing while facilitating the formation of an appropriate yield curve, and 
as a consequence, lead to enhancing the sustainability of the policy. In addition, as for ETF 
purchases,  from  the  same  aspect  of  enhancing  the  sustainability  of  the  policy,  the  Bank 
made  it  clear  that  it  might  increase  or  decrease  the  amount  of  purchases  depending  on 
market conditions, while maintaining the annual pace of increase in the amount outstanding 
of about 6 trillion yen. 
 Almost  two  months  have  passed  since  this  policy  decision  was  made.  So  far,  stock  prices 
and foreign exchange rates have been stable on the whole, and the Bank recognizes that its 
policy intention was accepted by market participants without misunderstanding. Meanwhile, 
in  the  JGB  market,  transactions  have  become  more  active  and  price  movements  have 
increased somewhat (Chart 9). According to a survey conducted in August, the proportion 
of  respondents  answering  that  the  degree  of  bond  market  functioning  "has  improved" 
exceeded the proportion of those answering that it "has decreased" for the first time in about 
three years. As market transactions usually tend to decrease in summer and it is difficult to 
grasp  actual  developments,  the  Bank  will  continue  to  thoroughly  examine  the  degree  of 
 8 
recovery in market functioning. 
 I have been given the opportunity to talk to you at this time every year, and this is the sixth 
occasion for me to do so since taking office as Governor of the Bank of Japan in April 2013. 
Six years ago, economic recovery had just started and overcoming deflation was not in sight. 
Under  such  developments  in  economic  activity  and  prices,  it  was  necessary  to  decisively 
implement  a  large-scale  policy,  and  thus  the  policy  that  should  be  taken  and  the  Bank's 
thinking  behind  it  were  simple  and  clear.  Over  the  past  five  years,  Japan's  economy  has 
continued  its  long-lasting  recovery,  corporate  profits  have  been  at  record  highs,  and  the 
employment situation has improved substantially. Wages and prices are no longer seeing a 
sustained  decline  and  have  turned  to  an  uptrend.  However,  achieving  the  price  stability 
target of 2 percent is taking more time than expected. In such a situation where economic 
activity and prices have improved significantly but their developments have been somewhat 
varied,  it  is  appropriate  to  conduct  monetary  policy  by  taking  account  of  a  variety  of 
developments  in  a  comprehensive  manner.  This  means  that,  in  continuing  with  powerful 
monetary  easing,  we  now  need  to  consider  both  its  positive  effects  and  side  effects  in  a 
balanced  manner.  The  latest  policy  response  is  indeed  in  line  with  this  thinking,  and  the 
Bank's  stance  toward  aiming  at  price  stability  with  a  view  to  contributing  to  the  sound 
development  of  the  national  economy  has  not  changed  at  all.  Going  forward,  it  will 
continue  to  make  its  utmost  efforts  as  a  central  bank,  taking  account  of  developments  in 
economic  activity  and  prices  as  well  as  financial  conditions,  and  thereby  firmly  support 
corporate activities in Japan. 
 Thank you very much for your attention.

Persistently Continuing with Powerful Monetary Easing
Forward guidance for policy rates
"The Bank intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an 
extended period of time, taking into account uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including 
the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in October 2019."
⇒ Strengthening the commitment to achieving the price stability target
Enhancing the sustainability of  "Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with 
Yield Curve Control"
Long-term interest rate: The Bank maintains the target level of around zero percent. While doing so, 
the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on 
developments in economic activity and prices. 
Purchases of ETFs:        The Bank maintains the annual pace of increase in the amount outstanding of 
about 6 trillion yen. While doing so, the Bank may increase or decrease 
the amount of purchases depending on market conditions.                                  
etc.
