TESTIMONY BY THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANCO DE ESPAÑA BEFORE PARLIAMENT  
IN RELATION TO THE DRAFT STATE AND SOCIAL SECURITY BUDGET FOR 2019
Ladies and gentlemen, 
For the first time I am appearing before you in this Chamber as part of the process to discuss 
and approve the State and Social Security Budget for 2019 (hereinafter “Draft Budget”). 
During my address I shall first be reviewing the developments in and the macroeconomic 
outlook  for  the  Spanish  economy,  within  the  international  context.  I  shall  then  offer  my 
views on the main aspects of the Draft Budget for 2019. To conclude, I shall mention what 
are, in my opinion, the fiscal policy challenges our country faces over the coming years.
1  MACROECONOMIC FORECASTS FOR THE SPANISH ECONOMY 
The Banco de España’s latest macroeconomic projections for the Spanish economy were 
published on 14 December last year,1 taking as a reference the information available at 
end-November.  These  projections  were  part  of  the  joint  exercise  conducted  by  the 
Eurosystem central banks, whose results for the euro area were released by the European 
Central Bank (ECB) a day earlier. 
1.1  External environment and financial conditions 
The forecasts are produced drawing on information that characterises the context of the 
Spanish economy (in particular regarding the international environment and monetary and 
financial conditions) (see Table 1). According to these assumptions, the expected course 
of activity in and imports from the main geographical areas with which Spain trades were 
revised downwards over the course of 2018. The resulting growth rates for Spain’s export 
markets in 2019 were estimated at slightly over 3%, a similar rate to that forecast for 2018, 
but significantly lower than that observed in 2017. The price of oil per barrel is expected to 
stand below $70 on average in 2019, 6% less than in 2018. Finally, I should stress that 
borrowing conditions for households and firms are expected to remain easy. 
Allow  me  to  go  into  greater  detail  on  some  of  the  above.  Regarding  the  international 
environment, the world economy admittedly ended 2018 maintaining a broadly expansionary 
course. But the signs of an across-the-board slowdown are evident, albeit more marked 
in some regions than in others. Largely, this is in response to the partial materialisation of 
certain  focal  points  of  uncertainty,  assailing  the  world  economy  since  early  last  year. 
These include most notably the trade tensions between the United States and China, the 
uncertainty over the terms of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union 
(EU) and some tightening of global financial conditions. The first of these factors, namely 
trade tensions, have already been reflected in the lower growth of global trade in 2018 
(4%, compared with 5.3% in 2017), which does not prevent them from continuing to pose 
a significant downside risk, subject to the future of the international negotiations currently 
under way.

Global financial conditions, which were exceptionally favourable in previous years, have 
begun to go into reversal. They have done so more acutely in certain particularly vulnerable 
emerging  market  economies,  and  relatively  moderately  –  to  date  –  in  the  advanced 
economies where share prices have fallen and corporate debt spreads have risen since 
mid-2018. 
Against  this  background,  consumer  price  indices  have  tended  to  post  significant 
slowdowns in the final stretch of 2018, which are mainly due to the notable recent decline 
in oil prices. 
In the euro area, the lesser pace of economic activity in the first three quarters of 2018 led 
the  ECB,  in  December,  to  revise  down  its  growth  forecast  for  the  year  to  1.9%,  0.6 
percentage  points  (pp)  less  than  in  2017.  Discounting  the  effect  of  certain  transitory 
factors, such as strikes, bad weather and, more recently, the temporary difficulties in the 
automobile  industry,  especially  in  Germany,  and  the  “yellow  jackets”  crisis  in  France, 
everything points to a significant slowdown in the pace of expansion of the euro area in 
2018  compared  with  2017.  Of  particular  note  is  the  sluggishness  of  exports,  weighed 
down  by  the  moderation  of  global  trade  and  by  the  possible  lagged  effects  of  the 
appreciation of the euro. Conversely, domestic demand appears to have remained firmer, 
at least until the most recent period, underpinned by the favourable financial conditions 
and the growth of employment and of household and corporate income. According to the 
latest ECB forecasts, the expenditure of these agents will continue to allow GDP growth 
rates in the euro area to remain somewhat above their potential over the coming years. 
However, it cannot be ruled out that the increase in political and trade uncertainty may 
ultimately constrain the growth of business investment plans. This is especially the case in 
certain economies, such as Italy, where some signs of a tightening in financial conditions 
are already discernible, in a setting in which Italian public debt yields have, since spring 
last year, held at relatively high levels. 
The lower rate of growth in the euro area has contributed to delaying the prospect of a 
pick-up in the core component of euro area inflation somewhat. And compounding this 
has  been  the  effect  of  the  recent  decline  in  oil  prices  on  overall  inflation.  In  these 
circumstances,  the  ECB’s  monetary  policy  maintains  a  markedly  expansionary  stance,

aiming  to  prompt  the  convergence  of  inflation,  in  the  medium  term,  towards  rates  of 
increase in prices that are below but close to 2%. Backing this trajectory is the foreseeable 
progressive  widening  of  the  output  gap  and  the  increase  in  labour  costs  observed  in 
recent quarters. 
At  this  moment,  once  the  Eurosystem  has  ceased  to  acquire  new  assets  under  its 
purchase programme, the expansionary stance of the common monetary policy at the 
start of this year has been mainly determined by two developments: the ECB Governing 
Council’s announcement that interest rates would remain unchanged at least until the 
summer of 2019; and the reinvestment over a prolonged period (in any event, for the 
time  needed  to  prompt  the  sustainable  convergence  of  inflation  on  its  medium-term 
reference)  of  the  financial  securities  acquired  under  the  ECB’s  quantitative  easing 
programme. 
1.2  The Spanish economy: developments and outlook 
In this setting, in 2019 the Spanish economy will remain on the expansionary course on 
which it embarked six years ago. But there will be a further easing in its growth rate, to 
2.2%,  compared  with  the  increase  of  2.5%  estimated  for  2018  (see  Table  2).  The 
expected slowdown is largely in response to the weaker international setting I mentioned 
earlier. Nevertheless, the Spanish economy has, in recent quarters, proven significantly 
resilient, slowing to a lesser degree than our main area of reference, namely the euro 
area. The contributing factors include, among others, the boost to household income 
arising from the entry into force, in the second half of 2018, of certain measures included 
in the Draft Budget for 2018. 
The continuation of the current upswing in 2019 will continue to rest on the expansion of 
domestic  demand  (see  Chart  1).  Underpinning  this  will  be:  financial  conditions  that  are 
expected  to  remain  relatively  favourable;  an  improvement  in  the  financial  position  of 
households  and  firms;  the  gains  in  competitiveness  observed  throughout  the  recovery; 
and  the  strength  of  the  employment  creation  process.  It  is  expected  that  employment 
creation  will  slow  this  year,  partly  owing  to  the  lesser  pace  of  activity,  but  also  to  the 
increase of more than 22% in the national minimum wage. In any event, according to the 
Banco  de  España’s  projections,  the  annual  growth  in  numbers  employed  will  stand  at 
around 1.6% in 2019, providing for further reductions in the unemployment rate, to around 
14% at end-2019 (see Chart 2). 
All told, there are grounds for a progressive slackening of economic growth in Spain over 
the coming years. These are, namely: the recent easing in global growth, which is proving

particularly  marked  in  the  euro  area;  the  progressive  normalisation  of  monetary  and 
financial conditions; and the very limits on the growth of domestic demand, such as, for 
example, those derived from the current, historically low levels of the household saving 
rate. On Banco de España estimates, the Spanish economy’s already positive output gap 
will widen during 2019 (see Chart 3). 
The recent course of consumer prices in Spain has once more been greatly influenced by 
the behaviour of oil prices. These fell strongly in the closing months of 2018 and account 
for the decline in the year-on-year rate of change in the harmonised index of consumer 
prices  (HICP)  to  1.2%  in  December.  Relative  to  expectations,  moreover,  the  latest 
November  and  December  figures  were  a  surprise  on  the  downside,  largely  –  but  not 
exclusively – due to the behaviour of energy prices (see Chart 6). Conversely, core inflation, 
which excludes the more volatile elements such as energy and fresh food, continues to 
stand at around 1%, but it is expected to begin to rise in 2019 as GDP growth rates remain 
above  potential.  The  opposing  trajectories  of  the  energy  and  core  components  will 
determine how prices trend in the coming years. In terms of the overall indicator, prices will 
slow in 2019 (see Table 2).

The  projections  report  published  in  December  also  included  a  forecast  of  the  Spanish 
general  government  deficit  for  2019,  consistent  with  the  macroeconomic  and  financial 
picture I have just described, with the deficit then being estimated at 2.4% of GDP (see 
Chart 4). Nonetheless, as indicated in the report, this estimate was subject to greater than 
usual uncertainty, as a result of the indefiniteness surrounding the budgetary cycle at the 
information cut-off date for the exercise, in late November. In particular, at that time neither 
the Draft Budget for 2019 nor the plans for the creation of the new taxes announced in the 
October  2018  draft  budgetary  plan  had  been  submitted  to  Parliament,  meaning  that 
uncertainty over the scope and details of the new measures persisted. 
Consequently, the assumptions for budgetary policy in 2019 did not include these new 
measures. The only exceptions were those measures that had already been approved (the 
tax reductions in Royal Decree-Law 15/2018 of 5 October 2018 on urgent measures for the 
energy transition and the protection of consumers, and the impact of the Supreme Court 
ruling of 5 October 2018, which stipulates exemption for maternity benefits for personal 
income tax purposes), or those that were more clearly defined since they were in response 
to specific agreements (the inflation-linked rise in pensions, and those relating to public-
sector employment and wages). 
In  the  fiscal  policy  arena,  moreover,  I  should  like  to  point  out  that  the  latest  budgetary 
outturn figures appear to confirm an exit scenario from the Excessive Deficit Procedure in

which  Spanish  general  government  has  been  immersed  since  2009,  as  part  of  the 
“corrective arm” of the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact. Specifically, the budget deficit is 
expected to be below 3% of GDP both in 2018 and 2019.
1.3  Main risks and elements of vulnerability 
The  macroeconomic  and  financial  scenario  I  have  just  sketched,  which  prolongs  the 
expansionary  phase  of  the  Spanish  economy,  is,  however,  subject  to  certain  downside 
risks. It should also be added that these risks have tended to increase recently and are 
being reflected in sharper downward revisions of analysts’ opinions on the outlook for the 
global economy in 2019 (see left-hand panel of Chart 5).
In  the  international  sphere,  as  I  have  already  mentioned,  some  of  the  elements  
which have already adversely affected activity in recent quarters may have even more 
unfavourable effects in the future. Such is the case, for example, of the possible adoption

of additional protectionist measures by some countries and of the potential responses 
to them by other economies. Nor can we rule out fresh tensions linked to the changes 
in US monetary policy, particularly in those economies with a high dollar-denominated 
debt and, in general, in the international financial markets. Also, the final terms of the 
UK’s exit from the EU continue to be highly uncertain, with possible adverse effects on 
the euro area (see right-hand panel of Chart 5), where, moreover, uncertainty regarding 
the fiscal policy of certain countries persists. All these elements may contribute to a 
strengthening  of  the  decelerating  trend  in  world  trade  and  activity  which  is  already 
under way.
In  Spain,  this  deceleration  has  already  caused  some  deterioration  in  the  economy’s 
current-account deficit. The compatibility of strong domestic demand with an ongoing 
external  surplus  has  unquestionably  been  one  of  the  most  positive  features  of  the 
current  upturn,  compared  with  previous  ones.  However,  some  of  the  factors  which 
favoured  the  strong  performance  of  the  external  balance  have  tended  to  lose  steam 
recently, as is the case of the higher energy bill during much of 2018 due to oil price 
rises and the weaker tourism flows from the rest of the world. In the future, persistence 
of the recently observed moderation in activity on a global scale, particularly in the euro 
area, or a hypothetical increase in the cost of funding Spanish external debt will pose 
risks for the performance of the external balance. At the same time, the need to reduce 
the still-high external debt makes it essential for the Spanish economy to keep running 
external surpluses in a sustained manner.
1.4  Macroeconomic projections of the Draft Budget
The Draft Budget is based on macroeconomic projections of real GDP growth in Spain of 
2.2% in 2019, down 0.4 pp from the 2.6% projected by the government for 2018, while the 
increase  in  nominal  GDP  is  estimated  at  around  3.8%.  This  growth  projection  and  its 
composition  are  generally  consistent  with  the  baseline  scenario  of  macroeconomic 
projections for Spain published by the Banco de España in mid-December and with those 
of most analysts (see left-hand panel of Chart 7). 
However, I would like to point out the two risks which I consider most significant for the 
macroeconomic scenario of the Budget. 
BANCO DE ESPAÑA  7 
 TESTIMONY BY THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANCO DE ESPAÑA BEFORE PARLIAMENT IN RELATION TO THE DRAFT STATE AND SOCIAL 
SECURITY BUDGET FOR 2019
First, the macroeconomic projections of the Budget include an adjustment to the budget 
deficit clearly exceeding that expected by other analysts (see right-hand panel of Chart 7). 
In particular, the deficit target for general government as a whole stands at 1.3% of GDP 
in 2019, which is a reduction of 1.4 percentage points (pp) with respect to the envisaged 
final figure of 2.7% for 2018. By contrast, the projections of the Banco de España and of 
most  analysts,  as  reflected  by  the  Consensus  Economics  Forecasts,  put  the  deficit  for 
2019 above 2%. Therefore, if the greater fiscal efforts required to meet the deficit target for 
general government as a whole included in the Draft Budget, amounting to 1.3% of GDP, 
were included in the projections of other analysts, their economic growth estimates for this 
year would be liable to a risk of downward revision.
Second, as I noted when looking at the macroeconomic scenario, the overall economic 
slowdown is becoming stronger, particularly in the euro area, which poses downside risks 
to the macroeconomic scenarios of the Draft Budget and of the Banco de España.
I now review the main courses of action defined by the Draft Budget for budgetary policy 
in 2019.
2  DRAFT STATE AND SOCIAL SECURITY BUDGET FOR 2019
Meeting the deficit target of 1.3% of GDP for general government as a whole included in the 
Draft  Budget  depends  largely  on  the  projected  growth  of  taxes  and  social  security 
contributions. On official estimates, the additional revenue would be sufficient to finance a 
significant portion of the proposed increase in the spending of the State (observing the ceiling 
set by the Council of Ministers), the social security system and regional and local government.
Regarding the behaviour of government spending, many, albeit not all, of the measures in 
the  Draft  Budget,  were  included  in  the  budgetary  plan  published  by  the  government  in 
October 2018, which moreover provided the expected broad outline of the budgets for the 
rest of general government. The budgetary plan projected an increase in overall government 
expenditure in 2019 of 3.1% (in National Accounts terms), below nominal GDP growth for 
that year, thus allowing a corresponding reduction of the budget-deficit-to-output ratio.
2.1  Main public spending measures 
The Draft Budget includes an increase in public-sector employee compensation of 2.25% 
in 2019, plus an additional 0.25% if GDP growth in 2018 is equal to or higher than 2.5%, 
and other additional funds for specific targets and bodies. The hiring policy of the past two 
years  remains  in  place,  with  replacement  rates  being  increased  in  some  sectors  and 
additional measures being taken on working hours and temporary contracts. As regards 
social benefits, the Draft Budget includes a rise of 1.6% in State pensions and growth of 
3% in minimum and non-contributory pensions in 2019, and an increase of 4 pp in the 
regulatory base of widows’ pensions. Other spending measures are the reinstatement of 
unemployment benefits for persons over 52 years old, more funds for dependent persons 
and the extension of paternity leave to eight weeks.
The Draft Budget exhaustively details the other spending measures and priorities, which I 
shall  not  repeat  here  for  the  sake  of  brevity.  In  all,  in  2019  State  expenditure  will,  in 
accordance with this Draft Budget and in budgetary accounting terms, grow by 6.7% with 
respect to the budget outturn projection provided for 2018 (see Chart 8). By component,

among the payments subject to greater discretionality, purchases of goods and services 
will grow by 2.7%; capital expenditure by 7.9%; and expenditure on staff by 4.8%. Among 
the  expenditure  items  influenced  by  the  behaviour  of  the  financial,  macroeconomic  or 
demographic fundamentals, interest payments in cash terms will grow by 4.6% in 2019, 
while, in the social security budget, spending on contributory pensions will increase by 
5.3% and that on unemployment benefits by 1.2%.
The targets for the less discretionary items taken as a whole are in line with the estimates 
of the models used by the Banco de España. This is particularly so for pension expenditure 
(the behaviour of which is determined by the increases agreed for 2019 and population 
ageing), unemployment benefits (which depend mainly on the behaviour of unemployment) 
and interest in National Accounts terms (which reflects the behaviour of government debt 
and of interest rates). 
2.2  Projected revenue in the Draft Budget
On the revenue side, a broad set of legislative changes is proposed, including notably 
an  increase  in  personal  income  tax  and  in  wealth  tax  at  higher  income  levels,  the 
establishment of a minimum rate of 15% of taxable income for large corporations, the 
limitation of double taxation exemptions, and an increase in hydrocarbons tax, focused 
on  diesel.  On  official  estimates,  these  changes  would  raise  government  revenue  by 
some €2.8 billion in 2019. Also, the Draft Budget includes the new taxes on financial 
transactions and certain digital services, with an officially estimated impact on revenue 
of some €2 billion in 2019.
The Draft Budget revenue projections are also affected by the introduction in July 2017 of 
the system known as “immediate supply of VAT information” (SII by its Spanish initials). 
Among the changes entailed by the new system in 2017 was the delay in the filing of VAT 
self-assessments (from the 20th to the 30th day of the month following the accrual), which, 
for accounting purposes, meant that the revenues for a month that would previously have 
been included in 2017 were actually included in 2018. Under the Draft Budget, with the 
new system firmly established, in 2019 the filing of VAT self-assessment will be put back 
to the 20th day of the month, so that there will be an opposite effect to the one in 2017.

b  Immediate supply of VAT information. In 2019, the submission date for VAT self-assessments shall be brought forward from the 30th to the 20th each month. 
This will mean that, for that year, revenue takings will cover 13 months, instead of 12.
c  Historical elasticities estimated by the European Commission.
Overall,  the  Draft  Budget  assumes  growth  in  tax  revenues  and  social  contributions  of 
8.2%, in budgetary terms, as a result of the entry into force of the measures announced, 
the effect of the above-mentioned SII and the growth in the tax bases, which basically 
depend on the macroeconomic situation (see Chart 9). 
These government revenue estimates are subject to significant downside risks, in National 
Accounts terms, arising from various considerations. 
First, the higher revenues under the new VAT SII system are not passed through to National 
Accounts  items.  Under  European  law  –  specifically,  Article  2  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 
2516/2000 – the impact on the general government deficit of taxes and social contributions 
must follow the accrual principle. This means that taxes should affect the deficit of the 
period in which the taxable events giving rise to the tax payments take place. Applying this 
regulation, the VAT accrued in 2017 and collected in 2018 was recorded in 2017 and, in a 
similar manner, the increases in revenue included in the Draft Budget due to the effect of 
the SII would not affect the general government deficit in National Accounts terms.
Second, although there is always some uncertainty regarding the response of government 
revenues  to  tax  bases  (elasticity  of  taxation),  the  Draft  Budget  projections  seem  to  be 
based  on  higher  elasticities  than  have  been  recorded  on  average  in  the  past.  This 
consideration is based on the Banco de España’s estimation of a set of standard models 
for the main items of government revenue (personal income tax, VAT, corporate income 
tax,  social  contributions  and  excise  duties).  These  items  are  made  to  depend  on  the 
growth  in  the  macroeconomic  bases  of  the  Draft  Budget  for  2019,  with  an  impact 
proportional  to  the  tax  elasticities  estimated  by  the  European  Commission  and  the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), to which should be 
added the effect of the measures I have already described, taking the impact on the Draft 
Budget  estimated  ex  ante.  According  to  these  calculations,  the  aggregate  collection  of 
shared taxes and social contributions would increase by 5.6% in 2019, as compared with 
the increase projected in the Draft Budget of 6.9%, correcting for the effect of the SII in 
both cases (see left-hand panel of Chart 9). The main source of this discrepancy is the 
difference in the projected social contributions (see right-hand panel of Chart 9).

 TESTIMONY BY THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANCO DE ESPAÑA BEFORE PARLIAMENT IN RELATION TO THE DRAFT STATE AND SOCIAL 
SECURITY BUDGET FOR 2019
The third source of risk for projected revenues that I wish to highlight relates to the fact that 
the  estimation  of  the  revenue  impact  of  the  new  taxes  is  subject  to  a  high  degree  of 
uncertainty, given the absence of any data on how they have functioned in the past.
Finally, caution should be exercised in relation to the potential delay in the entry into force 
of the measures accompanying the Draft Budget, which adds a further risk for expected 
revenues in 2019.
2.3  The government deficit target and the fiscal policy stance in 2019
Having discussed the spending policies and revenues of the Draft Budget separately I will 
now consider them together, in order to assess the uncertainty surrounding achievement of 
the  deficit  target  of  1.3%.  For  this  purpose,  economists  at  the  Banco  de  España  have 
conducted  a  preliminary  updating  of  the  December  projections,  which  I  have  already 
considered in detail. In particular, the impact on these projections of the revenue and spending 
measures that have been included in the Draft Budget since then is estimated, resulting in a 
general government deficit of around 2% of GDP in 2019, as compared with the Banco de 
España’s December projection of 2.4%. Moreover, the economic growth forecast would be 
revised down slightly, mainly as a result of incorporation of the impact of the tax measures. 
This tentative estimate suggests that achievement of the official deficit target of 1.3% in 
2019 is subject to far-from-negligible risks.
A smaller revenue impact of the new taxes than officially estimated, a delay in the entry 
into force of the tax measures included in the Draft Budget or potential materialisation of 
the downside risks to the economic growth outlook that I have already discussed would 
raise the projected deficit. On the other hand, a more dynamic response by tax revenues 
to macroeconomic conditions than historically estimated or a containment of discretionary 
spending would have the opposite effect.
In any event, the Banco de España will publish a complete estimate at the end of March, 
including an update of the macroeconomic projections with all the information that has 
become available since the last projection exercise was conducted in December.
As regards the fiscal policy stance in 2019, derived from these preliminary estimates and 
measured by the change in the general government structural balance, it would be roughly 
neutral. The level of the structural deficit would stand at around 2.5% of GDP, according to 
the Banco de España’s estimates, similar to its value over the last five years and higher than 
in 2013-14, which implies that practically the entire reduction observed in the government 
deficit since 2013 has been due to the effect of the business cycle (see Chart 10).
Although  the  general  government  “structural  deficit”  is  not  directly  observable  and, 
therefore, its calculation is based on assumptions subject to a high degree of uncertainty, 
it  is  a  useful  indicator  of  the  underlying  state  of  public  finances.  This  indicator  will, 
moreover, play a more important role in the new phase of fiscal policy due to begin, in 
the event that the EU Council eventually rules that Spanish general government is no 
longer  in  an  excessive  deficit  situation.  As  I  have  already  mentioned,  the  latest  data 
point in this direction. 
In fact, exiting the “corrective arm” of the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact would involve 
Spain  automatically  entering  the  “preventive  arm”.  Countries  in  this  situation  remain

subject to a set of rules restricting fiscal policy which, in Spain’s case, would mean that: 
first, the structural government deficit would have to be reduced each year by 0.5 pp of 
GDP, under normal conditions, until the medium-term objective (MTO) of structural balance 
were achieved; second, the annual growth of general government spending would have to 
be less than or equal to the economy’s potential medium-term growth; and, finally, the 
government debt-to-GDP ratio would have to be reduced each year by one twentieth of 
the difference between its level and the target of 60%. Given that the debt ratio stood at 
98.3% of GDP in 2017, the latest year for which data are available, this rule would require 
an average annual reduction of 1.5 pp of GDP over the next decade.
2.4  Government debt in the Draft Budget
According to the Draft Budget, the general government debt ratio will fall by 1.5 pp as a 
percentage of GDP, from 96.9% estimated in the Draft Budget for 2018 to 95.4% in 2019, 
continuing along the path of gradual decline observed since 2014 (see Chart 11). This is a 
result of the expected favourable development of nominal economic growth. However, if 
the  upside  risks  to  the  government  deficit  referred  to  earlier  were  to  materialise,  the 
reduction in the debt ratio would be more moderate.

3  FISCAL POLICY CHALLENGES
The  accounts  presented  should  also  be  assessed  from  a  more  general  standpoint. 
Accordingly, before ending, I will now refer to some of the challenges facing Spanish public 
finances.
First, it is essential that we move towards lower public debt levels (see Chart 12). The 
empirical  evidence  shows  that  maintaining  a  very  high  level  of  public  debt  over  a 
prolonged period may have negative effects on economic growth. These adverse effects 
arise because public debt absorbs funds that could be put to more productive use and 
alters  the  overall  financing  conditions  of  the  economy,  distorting  private  investment 
decisions. Moreover, in adverse situations, high indebtedness detracts from the stabilising 
capacity  of  fiscal  policy.  In  addition,  sustaining  high  public  debt  requires  maintaining 
primary surpluses over a prolonged period, which may call for higher levels of taxation or 
lower levels of productive expenditure. Lastly, one of the key possible adverse effects of 
high debt is the greater vulnerability of public finances to changes in investor or market 
sentiment.
According to simulations performed in studies published by the Banco de España, under 
credible assumptions, the process of reduction of Spanish government debt will be very 
gradual; indeed, several decades may elapse before the debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 60%, 
which is the benchmark set in the current European fiscal rules framework.
In consequence, it is crucial that advantage be taken of the current favourable economic 
setting to complete the fiscal consolidation process and create budgetary headroom in 
order to be in a position to address future downturns. The work remaining should take the 
form  of  a  medium-term  programme  setting  out  the  measures  required  to  meet  the 
budgetary objectives, together with prudent macroeconomic and public revenue forecasts. 
Reducing the vulnerability of Spanish public finances is even more important considering 
the  medium  and  long-term  challenge  posed  by  population  ageing  (see  Chart  13).  The 
latest  estimates  point  to  a  significant  increase  in  public  expenditure  on  pensions, 
healthcare  and  long-term  care  deriving  from  the  surge  in  the  dependency  ratio,  which 
even in the most optimistic demographic projections is set to rise from 25% at present to 
over 50% by 2050.
In the case of the pensions system, the 2011 and 2013 reforms included some adjustments 
that managed to significantly offset the effect of the expected increase in the dependency 
ratio in the long term. However, the 2018 Budget and the Budget for 2019 being discussed 
here today, mark an easing of the entry into force of those mechanisms, as they delay the 
application of the sustainability factor until 2023 and, in particular, they entail a return to 
the system of annual revaluation of pensions in accordance with the CPI. According to 
Banco  de  España  calculations,  the  permanent  reinstatement  of  this  indexation  system 
would entail an additional increase in expenditure of more than 3 pp of GDP in 2050. In 
consequence, in order to ensure the financial sustainability of the public pensions system, 
additional measures will be required on the revenue or the expenditure side, or on both 
sides, to offset that extra burden.
In  short,  I  must  stress  that  it  is,  in  this  respect,  essential  to  define,  in  accordance  with 
social preferences, the replacement rates that the pensions system should seek to ensure, 
so  as  to  subsequently  adjust  the  level  of  revenue  accordingly  and  thus  ensure  the

sustainability of the system. I believe this is a structural issue that requires broader debate, 
not confined to the habitual annual budget discussions. Indeed, population ageing also 
has  an  adverse  impact  on  the  participation  rate,  productivity  and  potential  economic 
growth, so a broad approach is needed to address this issue, both as to the time period 
considered and the set of economic policy instruments to be used.
In  view  of  the  medium-term  challenges  posed  by  the  high  debt-to-GDP  ratio  and  the 
impact  of  population  ageing  on  public  expenditure,  the  process  of  redressing  fiscal 
imbalances must be compatible with an increase in the quality of public finances. In this 
respect, the composition of the income/expenditure adjustment in the necessary medium-
term programme is of utmost importance in order to achieve the objectives set without

hampering economic growth. Accordingly, prudent and in-depth analysis of the structure 
of  general  government  income  and  expenditure  is  essential  in  order  to  progress  in  this 
respect (see the illustrations in Chart 14). On the expenditure side, there appears to be 
room  for  continued  progress  in  raising  its  efficiency  and  reorienting  its  composition 
towards  those  items  that  have  a  greater  impact  on  the  accumulation  of  physical, 
technological  and  human  capital.  In  this  respect,  the  outcome  of  the  ongoing  public 
expenditure review may be key to further progress in this direction. On the revenue side, 
there  is  room  to  consider  a  review  and  definition  of  the  tax  basket,  moving  towards 
structures more favourable to potential growth. 
In addition, in such a highly decentralised government system as the Spanish one, the 
regional authorities play an essential role. In this respect there is a general consensus on 
the need for reform of the system of regional government financing, tailoring the resources 
at their disposal to their requirements, based on a previous objective estimate of those 
requirements, in order to ensure a transparent distribution of funds and increase the degree 
of fiscal co-responsibility.
Lastly, let me add that this process of fiscal consolidation needs to be accompanied by an 
ambitious structural reform agenda to boost potential economic growth. In the Banco de 
España’s latest Annual Report, published in May 2018, we outlined a broad range of areas 
where such initiatives could be set in process. Here I would like to highlight two of those 
areas  (see  Chart  15).  First,  greater  labour  market  efficiency,  through  lower  temporary 
employment  and  improved  employability,  especially  in  the  case  of  less  skilled  workers, 
could boost economic growth potential. Second, productivity gains thanks to investment 
in  human  capital,  greater  innovation  and  the  elimination  of  inappropriate  barriers  to 
competition would also have beneficial effects on economic progress in the medium term.
Before I close I would like to mention, among the structural challenges facing the Spanish 
economy, those facing the banking sector. Spanish banks do indeed still face challenges, 
such as reducing their volume of non-productive assets, improving their capital structure 
and profitability, strengthening their reputation and making optimum use of technological 
developments.

4  CONCLUSIONS
I  wish  to  conclude  simply  by  emphasising  that  although  the  Spanish  economy  is  now 
entering  its  sixth  consecutive  year  of  real  GDP  growth,  and  that  this  growth  pattern  is 
expected to continue, albeit at a progressively slower pace, the risks to the prolongation 
of  the  expansionary  phase  have  increased  somewhat,  especially  in  the  international 
sphere. Thus protectionist measures, Brexit and the persistence of certain focal points of 
political and economic uncertainty within the euro area partially explain the slowdown in 
the global economy in 2018, but further adverse effects cannot be ruled out in coming 
quarters. In any event, the world economy is now at an advanced stage of the cycle, and 
the  Spanish  economy  is  not  immune  to  developments  in  the  international  arena,  in 
particular in the euro area, especially in view of the continuing high level of both external 
and public debt in Spain.
For this reason, efforts to continue to improve the budgetary position of the different tiers 
of  Spanish  general  government  and  to  bring  in  reforms  to  shore  up  confidence  in  the 
various economic agents and boost growth potential should not be delayed. These two 
conditions are essential to redress the existing imbalances and ensure continued economic 
growth and job creation.
Thank you for your attention.
