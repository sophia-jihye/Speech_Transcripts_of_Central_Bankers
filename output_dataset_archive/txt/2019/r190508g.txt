Radoslav Milenkov: Banking supervision priorities
Publication  of  Mr  Radoslav  Milenkov,  Deputy  Governor  (in  charge  of  the  Banking  Supervision
Department) of the Bulgarian National Bank, in the Quarterly Bulletin of the Association of Banks
in Bulgaria, issue 57, April 2019.
 A main priority of Banking Supervision is the participation in the process of effective accession to
the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) within the three working blocks, on which work is done
at the Bulgarian National Bank.
The first one is the development of the required regulatory framework. Work in this area reached
an advanced stage at the end of the last year with the adoption by the National Assembly of the
necessary package of legislative amendments, allowing for the synchronisation of supervisory
processes  between  the  ECB  and  the  BNB,  including  by  expanding  the  macro-prudential
supervision toolkit.
A  review  and  possibly  an  amendment  of  the  applicable  domestic  regulatory  framework  –
ordinances, guidelines – is pending with a view to achieving compliance with the ECB internal
technical  regulations  and  reflecting  the  ECB’s  discretionally  policy  in  key  areas  of  prudential
supervision and risk management.
The  second  is  to  continue  the  process  associated  with  the  synchronization  of  the  BNB’s
supervisory  and  prudential  practices  with  those  of  the  European  Central  Bank,  of  the  internal
rules and processes and of the information flows between the two institutions. The work done by
the BNB in this area is the logical extension of the reforms in the banking sector that started in
2015 and is expected to continue throughout 2019 with the following focal points:
• Development of an efficient organization for cooperation with the ECB within the supervisory
colleges and joint supervisory teams;
• Streamlining the supervisory strategy to match the new institutional reality resulting from the
close cooperation arrangements;
• Dividing the supervisory focus among important and less important institutions;
•  Organisation  of  collection  of  supervisory  and  statistical  data  for  supervisory  purposes  and
validation of supervisory reporting;
• Development of information systems consistent with the new stage in the supervisory activities.
The third working block relates to the organisation and carrying out of the asset quality review
and the stress test. The process is under way for the selected six banks and is conducted by
ECB in line with an ECB-adopted methodology and macroeconomic scenarios for the purposes
of the stress test. The bulk of the assumptions and parameters are determined by the Central
Project Steering Committee at the ECB with an established working communication between the
BNB, ECB and SSM in this process.
The Banking Supervision activities will continue through implementing the European regulatory
framework applicable to the credit institutions with a focus on the consistent implementation of
the technical standards and regulations, the Guidelines of the European Banking Authority and
the recommendations of the European Systemic Risk Board.
Priorities:
• Carrying on the practice of uninterrupted supervisory cycle by means of ongoing off-site control

and on-site inspections;
•  The  supervisory  review  and  assessment  of  banks  based  on  the  approach  developed  in
alignment with the ECB Internal Guidelines and the Guidelines issues by the European Banking
Authority.  The  purpose  of  the  supervisory  review  and  assessment  is  to  strengthen  the  link
between the dynamics of risks within the system, a bank’s risk profile, its own funds, its liquid
assets and risk management systems and internal control environment, which would serve as
the basis for reaching an overall assessment of the viability of each credit institution individually;
• Continuing the policy of conservative macro-prudential supervision aiming at accumulation and
maintenance  of  capital  buffers  during  the  economic  upturn.  The  objective  is  upholding  the
stability of the banking system, including by preventing or reducing the systemic risks involved in
the activities of credit institutions and identifying and limiting the emergence of macroeconomic
factors that would threaten the stability of the banking system.
