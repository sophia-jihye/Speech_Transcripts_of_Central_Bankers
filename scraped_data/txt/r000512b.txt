Lars Heikensten: Monetary policy and wage formation in Sweden
Speech  by  Mr Lars Heikensten,  First  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  the  Office  of
Labour Market Policy Evaluation (IFAU), in Stockholm, on 5 May 2000.
 Let me start by thanking you for inviting me to this seminar. Few things are more important for the
Swedish economy today than to ensure that we have a well-functioning wage formation system and
labour market.
In  my  introductory  speech  today  I  will  discuss  four  issues.  First,  I  will  present  the  argument  for
adopting  price  stability  as  the  Riksbank’s  chief  objective  and  say  some  words  about  the  Swedish
debate  on  this  matter.  Then  I  will  comment  on  developments  during  the  last  decade,  when  we
abandoned  the  high-inflation  policy  of  the  1970s  and  1980s.  My  third  subject  will  be  the  current
monetary policy situation and the choices that we now have to make. Lastly, I will comment briefly on
wage formation and the labour market in the light of this situation.
Discussion of the price stability objective
In  the  early  1990s,  there  was  a  shift  in  Sweden’s  economic  policy  towards  establishment  of  a
low-inflation regime. A few years later, price stability was established  as  the  objective  of  monetary
policy. This change was the result of a realization among policymakers that the policy of high inflation
and  recurring  devaluations  that  had  been  pursued  in  recent  decades  had  failed.  After  20  years  of
stagnating prosperity and major imbalances, it was time for a change of policy. A contributory factor
was the changing view of the potential of monetary stabilization policy since the late 1960s, as a result
of  which  almost  all  industrial  countries  adopted  a  price  stability  objective  during  the  1980s.  To
continue  to  pursue  an  independent  monetary  stabilization  policy  was  hardly  an  option  for  Sweden,
especially not if it was thinking of joining the EU.
An  important  task  for  the  Riksbank  was  to  gain  acceptance  for  the  change  of  policy  and  create
understanding for our work and our independent status. This has not been all that easy. I think there
are  several  explanations  for  this.  One  is  quite  obvious.  The  changeover  to  low  inflation  was
accompanied by a sharp downturn in the Swedish economy. Production declined for a period of about
two years and there was a dramatic increase in unemployment. The blame for this was laid at the door
of the policy shift. That was of course unfair, although I must admit that the decline was aggravated by
some policy mistakes. The basic problem was that the economic policy that was pursued in the second
half of the 1980s resulted in imbalances, in particular, bubbles in the financial and property markets
and an overvalued exchange rate. It was necessary to correct these imbalances, and this process would
have been costly in any circumstances.
However, these were not the only reasons why it proved difficult to gain acceptance for a low-inflation
policy  in  Sweden  and  why  the  thought  of  entrusting  monetary  policy  to  an  independent  institution
raised  doubts.  The  Keynesian  tradition  has  been  extremely  strong  among  Swedish  economists  and
across party lines ever since the 1930s. Therefore, the idea that the state can continuously control or
influence the economic situation has probably been more persistent here than elsewhere. Our strong
parliamentary tradition, which is based on the idea that all power derives from Parliament, has  also
played  a  part.  Countries  where  power  is  shared  more  evenly  among  the  political  institutions  have
found it easier to accept the delegation of monetary policy to an independent authority.
Having  said  this,  it  is  worthwhile  recalling  that  there  is  in  fact  a  completely  different  Swedish
tradition. The policy shift of the early 1990s is in fact a return to a long tradition of price stability that
was  temporarily  interrupted  for  a few  decades.  Between 1870 and  1970,  the  average  rate  of  annual
inflation was about 2%.

Without wishing to labour this comparison, it is perhaps nevertheless worthwhile emphasizing that the
20th century was a time of unprecedented economic growth; only Japan’s economy grew faster than
Sweden’s. But this historical pattern came to an abrupt end in the 1970s and 1980s.
Price stability does not in itself create growth and economic development. These are facilitated mainly
by other factors: the legal and institutional framework, the level of education, the will to invest and the
availability of capital, technological development, etc. But price stability focuses attention on the rules
governing  the  economy.  Those  who  set  prices  and  negotiate  wages  do  not  have  to  worry  about  an
erosion of future purchasing power but can expect price levels to remain stable. Similarly, there is less
uncertainty  when it comes  to  savings  and  investments,  and  indeed economic  decisions  of  any  kind.
Furthermore,  the  distribution  of  wealth  and  income  is  less  arbitrary.  This  was  a  key  argument  for
Gösta  Rehn,  one  of  LO’s  most  prominent  economists  of  all  time,  when  he  campaigned  against
inflation under the motto “Hate inflation”.
Although gaining a hearing for the policy of low inflation was an uphill struggle to start with, we can
see  that  the  idea  enjoys  growing  support  today.  Studies  show  that  more  and  more  people  back  the
Riksbank’s inflation target. The fact that the Riksbank now has an independent legal status is perhaps
a sign that Swedes have come to accept the price stability regime.
Results in recent years
It may be interesting against this background to examine developments in the last few years. Are there
any indications that the policy shift around 1990 has already had some effect? Obviously, the return to
price  stability  is  not  the  only  change  that  has  taken  place.  Economic  policy  has  changed  in  other
respects too. For example, budgetary policy has been tightened  up,  public  expenditure  has  been cut
and deregulation and other structural reforms have been implemented.
One way to understand the impact of the policy shift is to compare developments in recent years with
the  preceding  20-year  period  with a  high-inflation  regime.  Naturally,  all  such  comparisons  must  be
made with great caution, since  the  outcome  depends  very  much  on  which  periods  you  take  as  your
starting-point.
The argument for low, stable inflation is that it ensures a better environment for investment, improved
productivity, economic growth and increases in real wages and, in the long run, higher employment
too.

Let  us  make  a  comparison  between  the  period  starting  with  the  recession  of  the  early  1970s  up  to
1989,  when  annual  inflation  averaged  over  9.5%,  and  the  period  from  1993,  ie the  end  of  the  last
recession, up to now, with an average inflation rate of just over 1.5%.
Broadly speaking, the latter period presents a brighter picture. The total rate of investment, measured
in terms of year-on-year changes, is higher on average during this period, especially if investments in
housing are excluded.
The  average  productivity  of  the  economy  as  a  whole  is  broadly  the  same  during  the  two  periods.
However,  behind  the  average  during  the  first  period  lay  some  years  of  very  strong  growth  in
productivity in the early 1970s, offset by poor productivity growth during the 1980s.
The Swedish economy has grown by  2.3%  on  average  since the  start  of  1993. This  is only  slightly
higher than growth during the period 1971-1989. However, the composition of growth is different in
the  two  periods.  During  the  second  period,  growth  in  industry  has  been  just  under  3.5%,  which  is
about  1%  higher  than  during  the  previous  period.  The  difference  in  growth  would  also  be  more
marked if the latter period were to start only six months later. Average growth from mid-1993, when
the recession levelled out, to the end of 1999 was 2.9%.

The employment rate has increased substantially during the last few years. The difference between the
two  periods  is  even  greater  if  we  confine  ourselves  to  employment  in  the  private  sector.  In  fact,
employment  in  the  sector  fell  substantially  during  the  1970s  and  1980s,  at  the  same  time  as  public
sector employment  increased  rapidly,  a  development  which  would  not  have  been  sustainable  in  the
long run.

The  return  to  low  inflation  has  also  yielded  higher  real  wage  increases  for  employees.  Although
nominal wage increases have been moderate, low inflation  has  meant  that real  wage  increases  have
been considerably higher than previously. Nominal wage increases of over 9% resulted in real wage
increases of only 0.7% between 1971 and 1989, while nominal wage increases of less than 4% yielded
real wage increases of over 2% between 1993 and 1999.

The  general  picture  is  thus  encouraging.  All  in  all,  the  policy  has  yielded  satisfactory  results.
Naturally, it is too early to draw any definite conclusions from this. Many external factors have also
had a favourable effect on developments in recent years. The later period also started with very low
capacity utilization. But despite these reservations the situation certainly looks promising.
The current situation
The  question  today  is:  will  this  favourable  development  continue?  This  depends  not  least  on  the
development of wage formation. Before I go into detail on this subject, however, I would like to say a
few words about the Riksbank’s appraisal of the situation at the moment.
The Swedish economy is currently making a strong recovery. In the last Inflation Report the Riksbank
viewed that growth would be around 4% this year and average almost 3.5% in the next three years.
This seemed to be a higher rate of growth than the economy could sustain in the long run. As available
resources are utilized, price pressure will grow. The task of monetary policy is to ensure that growth
does not deviate too far from a rate that is sustainable, thus causing shortages and price pressure.

The Riksbank was of the view that, in the next few years, the inflation rate would be lower than what
might  be  expected  with  such  strong  growth.  One  reason  for  this  was  that  the  modest  increase  in
underlying domestic inflation anticipated in our forecasts was offset by a stronger krona and lower oil
prices. Our assessments also took into account the fact that in recent years domestic price pressure had
been lower than expected. We do not know exactly why domestic inflation has been so low in the last
few years. Deregulation of the electricity and telecom markets is one important factor. But competition
has increased in other product sectors too, due to globalization in general and to membership of the
EU in particular.
Our forecasts are also strongly influenced by our estimates of capacity utilization in the economy and
of potential growth. There is some uncertainty in both cases. In the last few years we have changed our
minds  and  become  more  optimistic  when  it  comes  to  capacity  utilization.  The  potential  rate  of
economic  growth  may  also  have  increased  somewhat.  The  slightly  higher  rates  of  investment  and
productivity suggest that a somewhat higher rate of growth may be possible. Nowadays, the Riksbank
assumes  a  potential  rate  of  growth  of  between  2  and  2.5%,  which  is  a  slight  upwards  adjustment
compared  with  the  1980s.  However,  uncertainty  about  these  factors  makes  it  necessary  for  the
Riksbank to keep a close watch on developments and revise conventional wisdom where necessary.

One of the most important variables when it comes to assessing future inflationary pressures is wage
trends. This is perfectly natural, since wage costs represent almost 70% of the total value added in the
economy and are therefore crucial  to  the  development  of  costs  and  prices.  Historically,  rising  wage
costs have covaried with inflation, even though substantial deviations can occur in some years since
inflation is also influenced by external factors, such as changes in oil prices.

At this stage of economic recovery, the labour market has functioned better in some respects than the
Riksbank,  and  many  other  observers  too,  expected.  Nominal  wage  increases  have,  as  I  said  before,
been moderate and vacancies have been filled without this leading to any substantial shortages. At the
same  time,  it  would  be  premature  to  breathe  a  sigh  of  relief.  The  labour  market  and  the  wage
formation system have not yet been tested to the full. The real test will come in the next few years
when  wage  negotiations  take  place  in  the  context  of  high  capacity  utilization  and  high  demand  for
labour.
BIS Review 39/2000

What should we expect of the labour market and the wage formation system?
Basically, there is a general, long-term macro framework for how high wage increases can go before
triggering rates of inflation that exceed the target. This framework only allows wages to increase in
parallel with productivity and inflation. If we assume that productivity growth in Sweden is about 1 to
2%, this would allow wage increases of between 3 and 4% over time, given an inflation target of 2%.
I know that many of those who are engaged in wage negotiations would not agree with this description
of  the  scope  for  wage  increases.  Let  me  therefore  mention  some  important  reservations.  First,  this
analysis  is  only  valid  in  a  situation  where  the  economy  is  in  balance  as  regards  employment.  In  a
situation with high unemployment, lower wage increases are desirable, since they stimulate growth in
employment.  The  analysis  also  assumes  that  profits  are  balanced  in  the  sense  that  sufficient
investments are made to ensure continued desirable growth. This was a problem when the EFO model
was applied in the late 1960s and early 1970s.1 Around 1970, wage increases became too rapid, and
gradually investment in Swedish industry declined.
The most important reservation, however, is that the analysis relates to the general, average scope for
wage increases  in  the  country  as a  whole. This  both  can  and  must  conceal  considerable  differences
between sectors and regions. The wage formation system must achieve something better than a result
for  the  economy  as  a  whole  which  is  commensurate  with  average  inflation  and  productivity.  If  we
want  low  unemployment  and  price  stability,  wage  outcomes  must  be  adjusted  to  productivity  in
different  sectors  of  the  economy,  indeed  to  the  situation  in  individual  enterprises  and  to  different
individuals.  The  design  of  pay  systems  and  pay  determination  is  also  crucial  to  the  distribution  of
resources and thus productivity and economic growth. In other words, higher productivity can create
more  scope  for  wage  increases,  but  a  functioning  wage  formation  system  can  also  help  to  improve
productivity.
Sweden’s  success  in  this  area  in  the  next  few  years  will  depend  both  on  the  measures  taken  by
Parliament  and  the  Government  and  on  management  and  labour.  Parliament  and  the  Government
establish  the  framework  for  the  functioning  of  the  labour  market  and  wage  formation.  A  more
expansive  financial  policy  would  make  the  task  of  management  and  labour  and  of  monetary  policy
more difficult in the next few years. The legal framework, for example the rules on industrial disputes,
is  another  factor.  Tax  and  benefit  systems  are  important  and  affect  both  wage  formation  and  the
behaviour of private individuals, ie their willingness to find work, move, etc. The Spring Budget Bill
noted that in  many  households  it  is  still not  profitable for  unemployed  persons to  seek  a job or  for
those  in  employment  to  work  longer  hours  because  of  the  way  the  tax  and  benefit  systems  are
designed. These marginal effects have, moreover, increased since 1991.
The system of wage agreements also has a bearing on the possibility of combining price stability and
satisfactory employment growth. The fact that several agreements concluded at the national level do
not include any individual pay adjustment guarantees, or very low ones, should increase the possibility
of determining wages locally and  gearing  them  to  productivity  development  in  various sectors. The
cross-sector agreements that have been concluded, including the Industry Agreement between about
20  labour  market  organisations,  include  rules  that  reduce  the  risk  of  periods  without  valid  pay
agreements  and  the  risk  of  conflicts.  This  is  also  a  change  which  should  help  to  improve  wage
formation.
Let  me  conclude  with  a  classic  quotation  from  a  previous  president  of  the  US  Federal  Reserve,
William McChesney Martin. He is supposed to have said that the role of the central bank was to “take
away the punch bowl just when the party gets going”. That is one way of putting it. The central bank is
always  on  its  guard,  always  ready  to  pounce!  But  look  at  the  story  from  another  angle.  It  is  in  the
guests’ own  interests  not to  let things  get  out  of  hand.  Behave  yourselves  well at the party  and  the
punch bowl will still be on the table when you go home! How long and enjoyable the present party
1 According to this model, the scope for wage increases in a country with a fixed  exchange  rate  is  determined  by  price
trends in other countries and domestic productivity growth in the competitive sector.
