 Kristina Persson: The economic situation in a monetary policy perspective 
Speech by Ms Kristina Persson, Deputy Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, at a conference by Sveriges 
Kyrkokamerala förening, Sundsvall, 11 June 2002. 
 First  of  all,  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  the  invitation  to  participate  in  your  congress  and  for  the 
opportunity to expound the Riksbank’s views of the Swedish economy at the present time. 
By way of introduction, I intend to discuss the role of monetary policy on a more general level and then 
to present the Riksbank’s view of the economic situation and inflation prospects on the basis of the 
most recent Executive  Board meeting,  where  we decided to  leave the repo rate unchanged. I shall 
also  describe  the  risk  scenario  and  how  we  see  developments  beyond  the  forecast  horizon.  In 
conclusion, I shall briefly touch on an issue that I have personally been interested in for some time, 
namely the economic aspects of a potential Swedish membership of the Eurosystem. 
The role of the Riksbank 
Let me first clarify the Riksbank’s tasks and explain how monetary policy decisions are taken, i.e. how 
monetary policy strategy is formulated. 
The  Riksbank  has  had  a  statutory  duty  to  maintain  price  stability  since  1  January  1999.  We  have 
chosen  to  put  this  in  operational  terms  by  means  of  setting  an  inflation  target.  This  is  defined  by 
stipulating that the annual inflation rate, measured in terms of the consumer price index (CPI), should 
be two per cent with a tolerated deviation of plus/minus one percentage point. Monetary policy should 
thus  be  conducted  to  keep  the  purchasing  power  of  the  krona  stable  with  regard  to  the  basket  of 
goods bought by an average Swedish household. 
This means that when central wage agreements are signed, the average wage-earner should be able 
to  be  fairly  sure  of  what  a  nominal  wage  increase  will  entail  in  terms  of  purchasing  power.  A 
predictable rate of inflation can also serve as a rudder when domestically-oriented companies set their 
prices.  Low  and  stable  inflation  expectations  reduce  uncertainty  concerning  the  real  effects  of 
borrowing and saving in krona for households and companies with their costs and income in Sweden. 
This  means  that  the  resources  within  the  economy  can  be  allocated  in  a  better  way  that  if  the 
consumer prices vary. A monetary policy that is credibly aimed towards an inflation target can thereby 
create good conditions for growth. 
Moreover, a monetary policy that it conducted with the aid of a symmetrical inflation target often has a 
counter-cyclical function. This means that it has a stimulating effect on the economy during a downturn 
in economic activity, as the inflation rate is normally low then, and vice versa. That, in a few words, is 
the philosophy behind the Riksbank’s inflation target. 
The Sveriges Riksbank Act also establishes that the Riksbank shall be autonomous, which means that 
we six members of the Executive Board, who make the decisions on the steering interest rates, may 
not seek or receive instructions from the government or parliament. The idea is that we are thus free to 
maintain  price  stability  and  will  not  be  tempted  to  concentrate  on  short-term  considerations  when 
making our decisions. 
It may appear that this target forces the Riksbank to give lower priority to the development of the real 
economy. We only have a target for monetary policy. However, the preparatory work on the Riksbank 
Act stated that we shall “without setting aside the price stability target, support the objectives of the 
general economic policy with the aim of achieving sustainable growth and a high level of employment”. 
In any  event, the assessments of the future path of the real economy play an important role in our 
decisions, as developments in economic activity are an important component in determining inflation. 
However, what is even more important is that there is no contradiction between good growth and price 
stability in the long term, quite the contrary. If we look at developments during the 1990s, growth after 
1992  was on average  3.0  per cent a  year, despite the fact that inflation had been below the target 
level for several years. Unemployment had at the same time declined from 9 per cent to around 4 per 
cent. This can be compared with the 1970s and 1980s, when inflation was approximately 8 per cent 
and  growth  was  on  average  2  per  cent.  Contributing  to  this  positive  development  was  the  fact  that 
BIS Review 37/2002

 there was good access to free resources in the economy after the crisis years at the beginning of the 
1990s. 
An important part of the Riksbank’s monetary policy strategy is clarity and openness with regard to the 
bases  for  monetary  policy  decisions.  The  purpose  of  this  is  to  create  support  for  the  price  stability 
target and understanding of what governs the interest rate decisions among the general public. This is 
also the reason  why  we Executive Board members often travel round making speeches. Openness 
and clarity on our part can contribute to stabilising inflation expectations in society and reduce the risk 
of unnecessary tension on the financial markets. 
As monetary policy has an effect with some time lag, interest rate decisions are based on forecasts of 
price  developments  one  to  two  years  ahead.  If  the  forecasts  show  a  rate  higher  than  the  inflation 
target, the interest rate is raised, and vice versa. In other words, the instrumental rate is adjusted so 
that the total assessment of inflation 1-2 years ahead, taking into account the risk scenario, is in line 
with the target. The assessments are described in the Riksbank’s Inflation Reports, which are issued 
4 times a year. 
As the economy is from time to time subject to unforeseen shocks, there will be deviations from the 
forecasts, even if the forecasts are well-founded. If, for instance, fruit-growers’ harvests are affected by 
insects, the price of fruit will rise, if the water reservoirs are not filled, electricity prices could rise and if 
cattle in Europe suffer various diseases, the price of meat and some other foodstuffs will rise. If the 
Riksbank tried to make adjustments for this type of temporary price disturbance, it would probably lead 
to large swings in monetary policy and unnecessary fluctuations in demand and production. 
It would therefore be wrong to give the impression that inflation will always be above two per cent. On 
the  other  hand,  it  is  important  that  the  Riksbank  adapts  the  instrumental  rate  so  that  the  inflation 
forecast one to two years ahead is in line with the target. This means that companies and households 
can rely on temporary deviations upwards or downwards being only temporary. 
In retrospect and looking outwards 
The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 11 September last year increased the 
uncertainty  as  to  how  the  already  weak  global  economic  activity  would  develop.  Even  before  then, 
signals  of  a more  evident  slowdown  in  industry  and  a  poor  development  on  the  stock markets  had 
caused the Riksbank to make a downward revision of its growth forecasts. 
The  risk  was  that  the  terrorist  attacks  would  undermine  confidence  in  future  prospects  among 
households and companies, which usually has a negative effect on demand. As inflationary pressure 
can vary according to demand and changes in the level of resource utilisation, the events caused the 
Riksbank and other central banks to decide to lower their instrumental rates shortly after the attacks. 
Now  that  almost  exactly  nine  months  have  passed,  we  can  conclude  that  the  impact  on  the  global 
economy was less than feared, although some sectors, such as the airline industry, were hard hit. 
Furthermore, we are seeing increasing signs that economic activity is improving both in the USA and 
Europe.  One  factor  that  often  contributes  to  turnarounds  in  economic  activity  is  companies’ 
stockbuilding. When stocks are well-filled and sales decline, companies cut back on production so that 
it becomes even lower than demand. This destocking then pushes economic activity down to begin 
with. When the cutback in stocks gradually reaches an end, companies can increase production again 
without  waiting  for  demand  to  increase.  This  gives  increased  strength  to  the  upturn  in  activity.  It  is 
probable  that  this  is  the  case  right  now;  according  to  several  indicators  production  has  begun  to 
increase  and  a  certain  amount  of  optimism  is  beginning  to  spread.  The  total  economic  policy  is 
expansionary in many countries, which provides additional fuel to the sequence of events. 
The economic situation in the USA and Europe 
This means that demand on Sweden’s most important export markets is increasing. The turnaround 
has  been  particularly  noticeable  in  the  USA.  There,  both  residential  construction  and  household 
demand  have  been  upheld  during  the  economic  slowdown  by  stimulation  policy.  In  addition,  strong 
productivity within US industry has contributed to improved profit margins. 
However, the upturn in the USA is expected to be fairly modest, which is mainly because households 
are expected to increase their low level of savings. (Diagram 1 - savings in the USA). There is a large 
2 
 BIS Review 37/2002
 savings imbalance in the US economy. Sooner or later an adjustment is expected. The weakening of 
the dollar that we have seen recently may be an indication that the adjustment process has begun. 
The  deficit  on  the  current  account  amounted  to  3.9  per  cent  last  year.  On  top  of  this,  households’ 
wealth in the form of shares is expected to continue to develop weakly and the rapid price increases 
on property are expected to subside. The US labour market does not appear likely to improve before 
the end of the year, which will give a subdued development in real wages. (Diagram 2 - unemployment 
in the USA, the euro area, Germany and France). 
At the same time, there is a risk that imbalances in savings in the USA will be adjusted more rapidly 
and more forcefully with the result that the US economy may lose speed. If the American household 
sector were to increase its savings and thereby reduce the debt burden more rapidly than is currently 
predicted,  it  could  lead  to  a  poorer  development  in  consumption  than  expected  and  a  stagnating 
economy. The factors that could trigger such a sequence of events include, for instance, US share 
prices continuing to fall or a decline  in house prices. On the other  hand,  developments in the  USA 
could  be  stronger  and  the  positive  spread  effects  to  the  surrounding  world  greater  than  we  have 
estimated. 
A  large  part  of  Sweden’s  exports  is  to  the  euro  area  and  economic  activity  in  these  countries  is 
therefore particularly important to us. The improved growth prospects in the USA will contribute to the 
recovery in Europe. However, a continued weak development on the European labour market and an 
unexpectedly high inflation rate will probably subdue the recovery somewhat. Germany, which is an 
important market for Swedish products, is still showing a very weak development. 
According  to  some  leading  indicators,  European  companies  have  become  more  optimistic  recently. 
However,  profit  margins  have  been  pushed  down  by  the  fact  that  productivity  has  fallen  and  when 
productivity falls, labour unit costs rise, which in turn reduces the scope for investment. This could be 
an explanation for the recent high inflation rate in the euro area. When the level of economic activity 
rises and productivity increases, the inflation rate is expected to subside. In addition, the high inflation 
rate can be partly explained by “secondary” effects from earlier price increases on food and energy, 
and possibly by rounding-off effects on the introduction of euro banknotes. (Diagram 3 - inflation in the 
euro area) 
Growth prospects are good for several important Swedish export markets in the rest of Europe. The 
level of activity in the Finnish economy is still poor, but will benefit, like the Swedish economy, from the 
global  improvement  in  economic  activity.  In  Denmark  and  Norway,  private  consumption  will  be 
stimulated by tax reductions. There are also signs of a turnaround in industrial activity in the UK, while 
private consumption continues to develop favourably. 
However,  there  are  also  risks  for  developments  in  Europe:  in  the  euro  area  the  main  cause  of 
uncertainty is wage developments. High wage increases for metalworkers in Germany may spread to 
other sectors and then to other countries in the euro area. There is thus some possibility that the rate 
of wage increase and inflation in the euro area will be higher than in the main scenario depicted by the 
Riksbank. 
The economic situation in Sweden 
The Inflation Report that was published at the same time as our interest rate decision paints a mainly 
bright  picture  of  the  Swedish  economy  in  the  near  future.  The  assessment  is  that  the  downturn  in 
economic  activity  will  be  shallow  and  relatively  short-lived.  The  recovery  in  global  market  growth, 
which  for  Swedish  goods  amounts  to  2-3  per  cent  this  year,  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  Swedish 
exports. Over the next few years, this increase is expected to become 7-8 per cent a year. 
At  the  same  time,  households’  disposable  incomes  are  improving,  which  contributes  to  increased 
consumption.  This  year  they  are  expected  to  increase  by  almost  5  per  cent,  almost  80  per  cent  of 
which will come from increased transfers and reduced taxes and charges. An increase in income of 
this  size  has  only  occurred  on  a  few  occasions  over  the  past  decades.  During  2003  and  2004  the 
increase  is  expected  to  be  almost  3  per  cent  a  year.  It  is  primarily  the  strong  development  in 
disposable income that is expected to contribute to an increase in consumption over the coming years. 
Consumption  of  durable  goods,  such  as  fridges  and  TVs  is  expected  to  increase  in  particular.  An 
expected recovery on the stock market (albeit modest) and a slight rise in property prices are other 
factors that will contribute to an increase in consumption in Sweden. Public consumption in Sweden is 
also expected to grow, by approximately 1 per cent a year.

 As a whole, industrial activity in Sweden is showing several signs of improvement, although the upturn 
is still proceeding at a fairly slow pace. The recovery is fragmented. Base industries such as forestry 
and  steel  are  in  a  period  of  recovery  and  the  motor  vehicle  industry  is  also  showing  some 
improvement.  The  telecommunications  product  industry,  on  the  other  hand,  has  experienced  a 
continued  deterioration  in  demand.  In  mid-April  Ericsson  presented  an  interim  report  that  painted  a 
very gloomy picture of prospects for the near future and the company warned of redundancies. This 
development is a source of some concern and uncertainty. At the same time, the significance of one 
particular  sector  should  not  be  over-emphasised;  employment  at  Ericsson  corresponded  to 
approximately one per cent of the total number of employees in Sweden. 
In  recent  times,  the  Swedish  economy  has  been  characterised  by  a  clear  division  into  two  parts. 
Employment  in  manufacturing  declined  during  the  greater  part  of  2001  and  this  development  has 
continued during spring 2002. On the other hand, employment in the private services sector increased 
last year, although this rise has been subdued slightly during the spring. A generally weak demand in 
industry, combined  with problems of a more structural nature  in  the  information and telecom sector 
has led to considerable cutbacks in employment and vacant production capacity within these parts of 
the economy. At the same time, the expansionary economic policy has been a contributing factor in 
sustaining the demand for consumer goods and services. 
This  is  the  explanation  for  employment  remaining  at  a  high  total  level  and  even  strengthening 
somewhat  during  2001,  despite  the  decline  in  economic  activity.  Developments  during  spring  2002 
indicate  a  slight  weakening  on  the  labour  market  and  although  growth  in  the  Swedish  economy  is 
expected to recover this year, the positive effect on unemployment will probably be delayed until next 
year. The number of job vacancies has increased during the first four months of the year, while the 
number of notices of redundancy has declined. However, unlike last year, many of the vacancies are 
temporary summer jobs. In addition, the number of persons being notified of redundancy could rise in 
the near future as a result of Ericsson’s cutbacks. 
A problem for the Swedish economy is that there will be a large increase in the percentage of very 
young  and  very  old  members  of  the  population  during  2003  and  2004,  which  limits  the  supply  of 
labour. The labour supply is also affected by how the regulations on unemployment benefit, sickness 
insurance, etc. are formulated. The large number of employed persons who are absent from work as a 
result  of  sickness  or  other  reasons  also  comprises  a  significant  uncertainty  factor.  It  is  difficult  to 
estimate  to  what  extent  these  people  could  come  back  to  work  and  boost  production  capacity. 
(Diagram 4 - number of employed persons, excl. sick and other absentees). 
The public sector is expected to provide a positive contribution to growth in employment during the 
entire forecast period. While employment in industry is not expected to increase until the latter part of 
the forecast period. 
During 2001  wages increased by  4.3 per cent, according to preliminary  data. It is partly due to this 
high rate of wage increase that inflation has been above the Riksbank’s target level during 2001-2002. 
The wages statistics that have been received so far this year indicate a continued high rate of wage 
increase,  or  approximately  4  per  cent.  The  design  of  the  central  wage  agreements  and  a  slightly 
weaker labour market situation are some important factors in subduing the rate of wage increase. The 
weak growth in productivity during 2001 and falling profits can also have a subduing effect on wage 
developments. During 2003 and 2004  the  labour market situation is expected to gradually improve, 
which could contribute to a larger wage drift. A large part (70 per cent) of wages is determined at a 
local level. At the same time, inflation is expected to be slightly lower, which should have a subduing 
effect  on  the  wage  agreements  signed.  On  average,  wages  are  expected  to  increase  by  4.1  and 
4.3 per cent respectively during 2003 and 2004. 
Pricing  and  wage  formation  are  influenced  by  inflation  expectations  among  the  different  parties 
concerned,  and therefore  comprise an important part of the monetary  policy  analysis. Since March, 
households’  inflation  expectations  have  remained  around  2.5  per  cent  for  one  year  ahead  and  the 
National Institute of Economic Research’s latest economic barometer shows that companies’ inflation 
expectations have remained more or less unchanged. (Diagram 5 - Actual inflation (CPI) as well as 
households’ and companies’ inflation expectations). 
In April, inflation measured in terms of CPI amounted to 2.5 per cent. The effects of the disturbances 
in supply that temporarily contributed to higher prices on energy and certain foodstuffs last year have 
abated, which has contributed to a decline in the inflation rate. In the short term, inflation is expected 
to continue to decline as these temporary effects disappear from the inflation measure. (Diagram 6 -
4 
 BIS Review 37/2002
 Inflation. Outcome and main scenario). The forecast for underlying inflation, measured as UND1X, is 
1.9 per cent one year ahead and 2.0 per cent two years ahead. 
However, the uncertainty in the inflation forecast has increased recently for several reasons. Between 
2000 and 2001 GDP growth was subdued from 3.5 to 1.2 per cent, at the same time as inflation rose 
from  1.4  to  2.7  per  cent  on  an  annual  average.  One  possible  explanation  for  this  unexpected 
development is that the production capacity of the economy increased at a slower rate last year. The 
production  gap,  which  comprises  the  difference  between  actual  and  potential  production,  plays  an 
important role in the Riksbank’s assessment of inflation. The basic idea is that if the total demand in 
the economy exceeds the production capacity, it creates price pressure in the economy that can lead 
to inflation. Potential growth is thus the production level compatible with price stability. 
Production capacity depends on factors such as labour supply, production technology, capital stock, 
as well as institutions and  regulatory frameworks that affect the way the  economy functions. These 
factors also affect the development of demand in the economy. The fact that a gap can arise between 
the actual and potential production could be due to prices and production factors being slow moving 
and to  the fact that it takes time before production  and demand have  adapted  to a change.  As the 
economy is affected by different types of disturbances, the potential production capacity and the level 
of production vary over time. Disturbances can be temporary, such as a winter with little rain reducing 
the  water  level  in reservoirs at the power stations, or more lasting - for instance, a new production 
technique can affect capital stock and industrial structure. Many of the disturbances that occur affect 
both  the  supply  and  the  demand  in  the  economy.  According  to  some  calculations,  which  were 
presented in the Inflation Report, production capacity during the slowdown could have declined from 
approximately 3 per cent at the beginning of 2000 to 1 per cent at the end of 2001. At the same time, it 
is  important  to  emphasise  that  production  capacity  cannot  be  measured  in  a  reliable  and  simple 
manner, which means that this type of calculation is characterised by uncertainty. 
GDP growth  in Sweden  is estimated to amount to  1.5 per cent  this  year,  2.7  per cent  in 2003  and 
2.6 per  cent  in  2004.  An  important  issue  is  whether  production  capacity  will  increase  when  the 
economy picks up. After all, it is the long-term production capacity that determines whether growth is 
compatible with low inflation and can thereby provide a sustainable positive development in income 
and welfare in the economy. 
The most important factors with regard to developments in the near future are the labour supply and 
productivity. The labour force has increased considerably in recent years, mainly thanks to increased 
employment in trade and industry. At the same time, a reduction in the average working hours has had 
a counteractive effect. The decline in the average working hours over the past year is partly due to the 
economic downturn, as overtime has fallen. However, there also appear to be structural factors, such 
as a rising level of absence due to sickness and central agreements on shorter working hours, behind 
the decline. This indicates that the reduction in the labour supply could be at least partly of a more 
lasting nature. 
The decline in productivity during 2001 was limited in comparison with the declines in 1977, 1980 and 
1990. Greater openness towards the world around us, a higher level of education during the 1990s 
and certain improvements in competitive pressure indicate that productivity will continue to be higher 
than in the 1970s and 1980s. However, this also presupposes that productivity in the information and 
telecommunications sector will return to a good level. 
There are also other risks: Inflation rose more than expected last spring, which was only partly due to 
price increases of a more temporary nature. The rest was primarily due to wage developments in the 
services industries. When employment begins to rise once again, while the labour market is strained, 
there is a risk that the new central wage agreements signed over the coming years will be affected by 
the fact that others have previously received high wage increases. 
To summarise: low inflation and consolidated central government finances have meant that there was 
room  for  manoeuvre  to  meet  the  economic  downturn.  Last  year  Sweden  had  one  of  the  largest 
surpluses in public savings in the EU, which enabled an expansionary fiscal policy. 
The slowdown in 2001 also differs from the problem periods during the 1970s and 1980s in that the 
manufacturing industry’s competitive situation was very strong from the start. The weakening of the 
krona began as soon as one year before industrial activity slowed down and contributed to a strong 
development in net exports during 2001. Nor was it lack of competitiveness or a decline in productivity 
that lay behind the depreciation of the krona - it was financial flows resulting from the decline on the 
BIS Review 37/2002 
 5
 stock  market  and  portfolio  investments  connected  with  the  AP  pension  funds  being  given  the 
opportunity to invest some assets abroad. 
A recovery in the Swedish economy has now begun and the Swedish economy has a good foundation 
to stand on,  with a surplus in  both the central government finances and  in  Sweden’s trade  abroad. 
Inflation is on the way down. At the same time, wage formation and pricing behaviour in general will 
comprise an uncertainty factor when economic activity gradually picks up speed. It may therefore be 
necessary to implement further interest rate hikes in future. However, the next monetary policy stage 
depends,  as  always,  on  what  happens  with  regard  to  economic  activity,  inflation  and  in  the  world 
around us. 
Developments beyond the forecast horizon 
The  uncertainty  in  the  forecasts  increases  the  further  ahead  they  look,  but  despite  this  it  can  be 
interesting to look beyond the two-year forecast horizon in the main scenario. 
Economic  developments  during  the  past  decade  have  been  characterised  by  considerable  free 
resources following the crisis at the end of the 1990s. That is not the case today, and will be even less 
the case in two years’ time, if the economic upturn continues as expected. This changes the focus of 
economic policy. A decisive factor for economic growth will be the development of production capacity, 
as I have mentioned earlier. It is production capacity that governs the development in demand that is 
compatible with price stability. Here there are some worrying tendencies, which I have touched upon 
earlier. The labour supply in Sweden risks developing less favourably beyond the forecast horizon as 
a result of demographical changes. Shorter working hours would have the same effect. On the other 
hand, measures may be taken to increase the supply of labour and thereby affect developments in the 
opposite direction. This effect could be obtained by, for instance, lower absence due to sickness. It is 
clear that the way the labour market functions will play a decisive role for economic growth both in the 
coming two years and beyond the forecast horizon. 
An important issue for Sweden in the near future is whether we shall take part in the third stage of 
EMU. This will be decided by the government and parliament, following a referendum on this question. 
The  timetable  for  a  decision  will  be  determined  by  a  political  process.  Statements  by,  for  instance, 
Prime  Minister  Göran  Persson  indicate  that  a  referendum  will  be  held  as  early  as  next  year.  If  the 
result were a “yes”, parliament would decide to send in an application to the European Commission 
and  the  ECB  to  examine  whether  we  meet  the  convergence  criteria.  In  connection  with  making  a 
decision on application, Sweden would probably also have to take a position on participation in ERM2. 
The  government  has  said  earlier  that  if  Sweden  is  to  take  part  in  stage  three  of  EMU,  it  would  be 
logical to first tie the krona to this exchange rate mechanism. The economic criteria are the inflation 
rate, long-term interest rates, exchange rate stability and the budget balance and debt in the public 
sector.  Following  this  scrutiny,  the  European  Parliament  and  Council  of  Europe  would  give  their 
opinion on the Commission’s proposal and after this the ECOFIN Council would take a decision on 
whether Sweden could participate. 
If  Sweden  were  accepted  as  a  member  of  the  Eurosystem,  there  would  be  negotiations  on  when 
membership  could  occur  and  at  what  exchange  rate  the  krona  would  be  fixed  against  the  euro. 
Parliament decided as early as 1997 that Sweden should keep the door open for future membership 
by  creating  the  highest  possible  level  of  readiness  for  action,  by  means  of  technical  and  practical 
preparations.  The  Riksbank  has  therefore  been  working  on  internal  EMU  preparations  for  several 
years now. 
What would the economic consequences of membership of the Eurosystem be for Sweden? 
Swedish  participation  in  stage  three  of  EMU  is  essentially  a  political  issue  on  which  the  Executive 
Board  of  the  Riksbank  has  not  taken  a  stand.  On  the  other  hand,  earlier  General  Councils  of  the 
Riksbank  have  declared  themselves  in  favour  of  EMU  membership  on  two  occasions,  in  1994  and 
1997. 
So,  what  economic  consequences  would  membership  of  the  Eurosystem  have  for  Sweden?  One 
advantage, in my opinion, is the strength and stability entailed in belonging to a large currency area 
rather than a small one. Fluctuations in the value of the currency ought to decline, which would reduce 
uncertainty. The most evident economic effect of EMU membership would be the transaction gains as 
a  result  of  the  currency  borders  disappearing.  These  are  the  costs  and  the  inconvenience  of 
6 
 BIS Review 37/2002
 exchanging  currency  when  one  visits  or  trades  with  different  countries  in  the  euro  area.  Another 
concrete advantage is that the administration costs companies have been forced to bear to safeguard 
against undesirable fluctuations in exchange rates would disappear. 
It is probably of greater significance for the economy that a single currency would promote competition 
to the advantage of consumers, who would meet lower prices and thereby have more money left in 
their purses. When all parties use the same currency unit, it is possible to make price comparisons 
between countries. Competition also facilitates the work on holding back inflation. 
The EMU has particular importance for the scope of the trade. Many economists have tried to estimate 
this gain by looking at the way fixed and floating exchanges respectively affect trade, and they have 
found  very  little  difference.  However,  a  single  currency  is  not  the  same  as  a  fixed  exchange  rate. 
There are considerable practical and psychological differences. Professor Andrew K. Rose at Berkeley 
in the USA, together with some other economists, has instead compared trade within monetary unions 
with trade between countries outside of the monetary union, and made adjustments for facts such as 
monetary unions often sharing the same language, culture and other regulatory frameworks. 
When Professor Rose presented such a study for Sweden some time ago, he claimed that EMU could 
increase trade and integration by as much as 30-50 per cent over the course of a few decades. This 
could lead to an increase in Swedish welfare of over ten per cent in the long term. Rose himself admits 
that the figures are uncertain and other economists believe in much lower figures for trade gains. 
So what about the disadvantages? Giving up one’s own currency entails also giving up some of the 
right  to  self-determination  in  economic  policy.  The  instrumental  rate  would  no  longer  be  set  in 
Stockholm, but in Frankfurt and would reflect the economic situation in a large monetary area. 
The criticism of a Swedish membership of the Eurosystem has often concerned the possibility of being 
able  to  conduct  an  independent  stabilisation  policy  under  these  circumstances.  This  is  based  on  a 
supposition that the Swedish economy could for some reason become out of synch with the economic 
developments in the euro are, what is termed an asymmetric shock. An independent monetary policy 
and currency, in addition to fiscal policy, gives us the opportunity to stabilise our economy ourselves - 
a form of shock-absorber that will be lost if we have a joint monetary policy steered by inflation and 
economic prospects throughout the entire euro area. 
This was the primary reason why the Calmfors Commission, which examined the consequences for 
Sweden of participation in the third stage of EMU, concluded that Sweden should wait before joining 
the Eurosystem until the Swedish labour market and wage formation showed sufficient flexibility to be 
able to manage a serious shock.1 
It is often forgotten that one of the points of the EU is that the union shall function as an insurance; 
that the countries are strong standing together than they are standing alone. In practice, it is also the 
case that when the Swedish economy has come out of synch with the euro area, this has not been 
due to shocks over which we had no control, but to mistakes made in our own economic policy. There 
are also many indications that the covariance between Sweden and the euro area will increase further 
if we join the Eurosystem, as trade and integration with the euro countries would be strengthened. 
Increased trade and greater openness to the outside world have positive effects on the development 
of growth and incomes. In my opinion, the European integration of which EMU forms a part should not 
stop at the borders of the EU, but be the first step towards greater global openness. 
Conclusion 
I have today accounted for the current monetary policy situation in Sweden and the assessments that 
formed the basis for our decision last week to leave the repo rate unchanged. A low inflation rate (2%), 
which  is the target for monetary policy, does not in itself create good growth  and  welfare; it should 
rather  be  seen  as  a  fundamental  condition  to  ensure  that  other  parties  -  trade  and  industry, 
organisations, government and parliament - are successful in working to improve Sweden’s economy 
by  various  different  means.  In  other  words,  it  is  an  extensive  and  complicated  interplay  that  will 
determine how well a country’s economic potential is realised. The Riksbank does its best to ensure 
that monetary policy provides a contribution here. 
Thank you for listening!
