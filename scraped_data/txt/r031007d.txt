   Lars Heikensten: The Swedish economy and monetary policy 
Speech  by  Mr  Lars  Heikensten,  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  a  seminar  arranged  by  the 
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce and Veckans Aff(cid:228)rer, Stockholm, 29 September 2003. 
 Let me begin by thanking you for inviting me to speak at the seminar. 
As we all know, the Swedish people have voted to remain outside the single European currency. As 
regards  monetary  policy  this  means  that  we  will  carry  on  as  before;  price  stability  in  Sweden  will 
continue to be the focus of our efforts. We will be continuing to make forecasts of economic activity 
and inflation as a basis for our monetary policy decisions, and to publish inflation reports and minutes 
of monetary policy meetings explaining the reasons for these decisions.  
To some extent the outcome of the referendum must be interpreted as a vote of confidence for the 
stabilisation policy regime we have had over the past ten years. Important components of this have 
been a budgetary policy with an expenditure ceiling and surplus target, and a monetary policy with an 
inflation target. The changes we have made in stabilisation policy can only be described as a success. 
The  budget  balance  has  been  turned  around  from  a  deficit  of  12  per  cent  of  GDP  in  1993  to  a 
substantial surplus at the beginning of 2000. Inflation has been stable and has largely been close to 
2 per cent. The inflation expectations of all economic agents today are firmly entrenched around 2 per 
cent. The outlook is similar for the future. We expect growth to exceed that in many other countries. 
Meanwhile, inflation is expected to be in line with our target. A surplus is forecast in both the public 
finances and the current account.  
Today I will begin by discussing financial market developments since the referendum. Subsequently I 
will discuss how economic activity and inflation may develop over the coming years. After giving my 
view on the salient features of this, I will discuss a number of factors that are particularly difficult to 
assess. Finally, I intend to touch upon potential problems in the longer term.  
The financial markets 
In our inflation assessments during the summer, we forecast that the krona exchange rate against the 
euro  would  strengthen  irrespective  of  the  outcome  of  the  referendum.  We  also  forecast  that  this 
movement  would  mainly  be  smooth,  despite  the  possibility  of  some  unease  in  connection  with  the 
referendum itself, particularly in the event of an unexpected result. In the run up to the referendum, the 
krona weakened slightly more than forecast. Since then, it has appreciated substantially against both 
the  dollar  and  the  euro.  It  is  likely  that  these  recent  developments  have  been  due  to  market 
assessments of the relative strength of the Swedish economy compared with the euro area in the near 
future, but also to a revaluation of the dollar against the euro following comments from the G7 meeting 
in Dubai. All in all, developments in the krona have largely been in line with our forecast in the June 
Inflation Report.  
So the appreciation of the krona so far is in line with previous forecasts. Should the krona continue to 
strengthen - and particularly if there is also reason to believe that the appreciation will last - it will of 
course  have  implications  for  our  forecast.  However,  it  is  currently  too  soon  to  come  to  any  real 
conclusions for inflation in the near future from the perspective that is significant for monetary policy. 
What these developments have mainly illustrated so far is perhaps how greatly exchange rates can 
fluctuate and how unexpectedly quick changes in sentiment can be. 
Developments  in  the  fixed  income  market  have  been  less  dramatic.  However,  the  long-term  yield 
spread on Germany widened slightly in connection with the referendum. In all probability, the current 
yield spread is partly due to recently better growth prospects in Sweden than in the euro area. It is also 
reasonable to expect that we will have to pay a certain premium in the form of a differential between 
Swedish and German long yields for remaining outside the single currency. We can illustrate this by 
comparing the  yield spread in, for instance, Sweden, Finland and Italy (see Chart 1). Swedish long 
yields  are  higher  than  Finland’s,  whose  situation  in  terms  of  growth  and  government  finances  has 
been  roughly  in  line  with  our  own.  Our  yields  are  also  higher  compared  with  Italy,  despite  their 
markedly weaker public finances.

 The salient features of the economic outlook 
World  economic  activity  has  been  broadly  in  line  with  our  forecast  in  the  June  Inflation  Report.  If 
anything,  current  tendencies  are  somewhat  better,  as  concluded  by  the  Executive  Board  at  its 
monetary policy meeting in August. Signs of a recovery in the US economy have become increasingly 
evident,  which  is  pleasing  of  course.  The  outlook  is  different,  however,  for  the  euro  area.  Perhaps 
there is reason to expect a slightly longer delay in the European revival, even if we have recently seen 
a number of positive signals of a forward-looking nature. On the other hand, it appears that economic 
activity in Japan will be stronger than expected. On balance, it currently seems likely that international 
activity will be roughly in line with the forecasts we made in August.  
For  Sweden,  the  majority  of  indicators  point  to  an  upturn  in  economic  activity  in  the  autumn.  In 
accordance with our forecast during the summer, there are currently some unutilised resources (see 
Chart 2). This has mainly been due to a weakening in demand over the past two years. In addition to 
the relatively favourable capacity level, productivity growth has also been unexpectedly fast given the 
current  economic  climate.  In  the  near  future,  demand  is  expected  to  mount  due  to  both  solid 
consumption  growth  and  a  small  rise  in  investment.  While  GDP  growth  this  year  is  forecast  to  be 
moderate, around 1.5 per cent, growth in both 2004 and 2005 is expected to be appreciably higher, 
approximately 2.5 per cent. So growth in coming years is anticipated to be somewhat higher than the 
potential growth we had forecast for Sweden in recent years.  
If Swedish economic activity is to rise as forecast, there will need to be a pick-up in investment. This 
began  to  fall  as  early  as  2001  in  manufacturing,  and  the  following  year  it  declined  in  the  whole 
economy. Like many other forecasters we viewed the decline in investment as more transitory than it 
later proved to be. A year ago, our forecasts pointed to a turnaround at the beginning of 2003 (see 
Chart 3). In the June Inflation Report, it was forecast that investment would be delayed and begin to 
rise  at  the  beginning  of  2004.  During  the  second  quarter  this  year,  gross  capital  formation  fell  by 
approximately 2 per cent according to the National Accounts. And in its latest forecast from August, 
the National Institute for Economic Research expects an increase in investment to be delayed further. 
The situation is clearly uncertain, even if the fundamental conditions for a rise in investment are good, 
with low interest rates, stable equity market growth and expectations of a recovery in the international 
economy.  
Another source of concern is connected with Swedish household consumption. This has increased at 
the  same  time  as  we  have  witnessed  a  relatively  substantial  decline  in  the  value  of  household  net 
wealth. In recent years, household indebtedness has risen sharply and is now approaching the levels 
seen shortly before the banking crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. The interest ratio, i.e. post-tax 
interest expenses in relation to disposable income, is however at a relatively low level historically. So 
far the Riksbank has not judged these developments to be a problem for financial stability, at least not 
as long as any future rise in interest rates is accompanied by an increase in growth and income. But it 
is clear that households’ scope for consumption in the near future will be limited by their levels of debt 
and that this could subdue the recovery.  
As  capacity  utilisation  in  the  economy  today  is  relatively  low,  stronger  growth  is  not  expected  to 
constitute a more acute problem with regard to inflation. But when growth exceeds its potential, this 
normally leads to a gradual intensification of inflationary pressures. Since our last assessment of the 
situation,  some  new  data  has  shown,  for  example,  that  inflation  in  August  was  higher  than  we 
previously thought, owing mainly to electricity prices remaining higher than expected. Nonetheless, it 
is likely that inflation will continue to fall rather sharply over the coming six months. Monetary policy is 
focused on inflation a couple of years ahead, however. In August, inflation, measured in terms of CPI 
and UND1X, was forecast from this perspective to rise slowly to around our 2-per-cent target. There is 
currently no reason to alter this forecast markedly.  
Some factors that are difficult to access 
Of course there are factors that could thwart the main scenario I’ve just presented.  
One such factor is a delay in the European economic recovery. Several countries in the euro area are 
contending with growth problems. Germany’s GDP, which comprises one-third of that of the euro area, 
declined during the second quarter. Investment in Germany has fallen since 2000 while consumption 
has been weaker than the euro area average. There was also a contraction in second-quarter growth 
in  France,  whose  GDP  comprises  roughly  one-fifth  of  that  of  the  euro  area.  This  came  after  the 
country had enjoyed relatively robust growth in consumption in recent years, which had compensated 
2 
 BIS Review 42/2003
   for weak investment growth. There are also more fundamental problems in the euro area which could 
have a negative impact on economic activity. For instance, Germany is still suffering from the after-
effects of reunification. Moreover, the euro has appreciated sharply. In light of this, there is no doubt 
that the world economy is strongly dependent on a US revival. 
The  outcome  of  the  forthcoming  wage  bargaining  round  will  also  be  of  great  importance,  both  for 
economic activity and inflation prospects. It is clear that if real wage growth in the coming years is in 
line with productivity growth, this will facilitate the Riksbank’s efforts. The Riksbank’s forecast during 
the summer rested on the assumption that a weaker labour market would restrain the rate of wage 
increases to just over 3.5 per cent. But there are examples of wage bargaining rounds in which wages 
increased  excessively  despite  weak  demand  pressures,  e.g.  1995.  The  conflict  over  the  Municipal 
Workers’ Union’s agreement is also indicative of tensions in the labour market. However, the two most 
recent  wage  bargaining  rounds  have  been  characterised  by  greater  cooperation  between  labour 
market organisations. In addition to current  economic conditions, this suggests that the forthcoming 
wage negotiations should result in economically reasonable wage rises of around 3.5 per cent. It is 
worth underscoring, however, that no one factor is as important for inflation - and consequently for the 
repo rate - as wages. The Riksbank will therefore be monitoring the autumn wage bargaining round 
closely.  
One factor that has proved difficult to assess in recent years is energy prices, in particular those for 
electricity. Energy prices have not fallen back as much as we expected during the summer. In August, 
UND1X inflation excluding interest expenditure, among other things, rose by 2.2 per cent, of which 0.7 
percentage  points  were  due  to  the  increase  in  energy  prices.  Current  forward  prices  suggest  that 
electricity  prices  will  be  approximately  10  per  cent  higher  during  the  autumn  and  winter  than  was 
indicated before the summer. Also, the world market price of oil has moved higher than expected. 
Thus far,  the  stance  of monetary  policy  has  been  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  rise  in  energy 
prices  will  be  temporary.  We  have  refrained  from  raising  interest  rates  despite  inflation  being 
considerably higher than 2 per cent at times. An alternative way of explaining our approach is to say 
that we have focused on underlying, demand-driven inflation. Should energy prices remain elevated 
for a long period or continue to increase, inflation will of course exceed our forecasts thus far. This 
could have other implications for monetary policy if it were to have a marked impact on cost levels and 
begin to affect inflation expectations. 
The highly irregular developments in electricity prices are a considerable problem for many decision-
makers  in  the  economy,  not  just  for  forecasters  of  inflation.  A  comparison  of  electricity  price 
developments in Sweden and the euro area speaks volumes (see Chart 4). These developments raise 
important  questions  about  how  the  electricity  market  functions,  questions  that  concern  both 
competition and the conditions for the production of electricity.  
Summary of the outlook 
Even when taking into account the factors I have just discussed, the outlook for economic activity and 
inflation  has  not  changed  much  since  August.  The  upturn  in  the  US  appears  to  be  slightly  more 
evident, with less risks of a setback. In Europe, the outlook is instead somewhat weaker. For Sweden, 
it seems likely that the economy will experience a rather normal recovery next year. Consequently, it is 
also probable that inflation a couple of years ahead will be close to 2 per cent, roughly as forecast by 
the Riksbank in August, even if inflation in the forthcoming year may be lower. 
Long-term perspective 
Before rounding off, allow me also to touch upon the longer-term perspective. 
Over the last decade, the economic policy debate has largely centred on stabilisation policy. The fact 
that stabilisation policy was in focus during the first half of the 1990s is easy to understand. Following 
a  severe  crisis  caused  largely  by  mistakes  in  stabilisation  policy,  we  changed  our  exchange  rate 
regime and altered the focus of both our monetary policy and fiscal policy. In the EMU debate, it has 
been  natural  to  continue  the  discussion  of  monetary  policy  and  exchange  rate  systems.  I,  at  least, 
believe that this discussion went a bit too far. It was easy to get the impression that welfare in Sweden 
depended solely on the Riksbank’s actions.  
BIS Review 42/2003

 This is not the case of course. The objective of monetary policy over the past ten years has been to 
ensure price stability. This has proved rather successful - inflation is in line with the Riksbank’s target - 
and it is important therefore that it lays a solid foundation for growth. But when we alter interest rates, 
it is mainly with a view to affecting demand around a long-term output trend. While this is important, it 
must  be  remembered  that  we  do  not  affect  the  trend  itself.  And  it  is  this  trend  that  determines  our 
welfare! 
So we must now shift our focus in the public debate from monetary policy and stabilisation policy to 
issues that determine Sweden’s ability to create growth and welfare. In fact, this has been important 
for a long time since Sweden suffered a considerable decline in welfare terms relative to almost all 
other countries, especially during the 1970s and 1980s. But it is particularly significant now in the light 
of the challenges facing us in the near future, particularly as a result of our ageing population.  
Essentially,  economic  growth  is  determined  by  how  much  we  work  and  how  productive  we  are. 
Nothing can change this. The number of hours worked is affected by a large number of factors; e.g. 
the  number  of  people  of  working  age,  the  number  of  these  that  are  employed,  absenteeism,  etc. 
Labour  productivity,  measured  as  GDP  per  hour  worked,  is  partly  dependent  on  technological 
advances (e.g. more modern machinery) or on real capital being supplied (a long-term expansion of 
the means of production). In addition to this are changes in productivity that result from the movement 
of labour from less productive to more productive sectors.  
The number of hours worked grew relatively favourably for a number of years after the crisis at the 
beginning of the 1990s. But it was essentially demand-driven. There were many people of working age 
who were unemployed after the crisis years and then found employment. But also from the supply side 
developments  were,  for  a  period  at  least,  positive,  partly  because  there  was  an  increase  in  the 
working-age  population.  In  recent  years,  however,  it  has  become  evident  that  many  people  have 
ended up outside the labour market, partly as a result of a rise in sick leave.  
As regards productivity growth, the trend in recent years has been more positive. At GDP level it has 
been approximately 2 per cent per year or slightly above. This differs from the situation in the 1970s 
and 1980s. It is likely that the changes in monetary and fiscal policy and increased transparency with 
stiffer competition have been important in this regard. 
So how should we feel about developments in the near future? When it comes to productivity, there is 
reason for optimism, even if the high figures seen in the 1990s partly reflect both rapid growth in the 
private  sector  compared  to  the  public  sector  and  robust  growth  in  the  ICT  sector.  Our  economy  is 
more  open  and  has  greater  competition  and  downward  price-pressure  in  many  sectors.  The  cost 
pressures in the public sector also have a similar impact.  
The outlook is considerably gloomier for the labour supply. As I mentioned, developments are now on 
a  downward  trend.  One  cause  of  this  is  that  economic  policy  in  some  respects  has  become  less 
focused on raising labour force participation. In terms of both transfers and taxes, changes have been 
implemented that reduce the incentive to work. Further changes are also being discussed along the 
same  line,  including  shorter  working  hours.  Furthermore,  the  age  structure  of  the  population  is 
becoming less advantageous from a labour perspective (see Chart 5). 
In a country like Sweden, where the costs of an ageing population have such a strong impact on the 
public sector, the supply of labour is particularly important. It is only if more people work and pay tax, 
and fewer make use of transfers, that it will be possible to notably relieve the pressure on the public 
budgets. And this will be necessary if we are to be able to maintain our current commitments in terms 
of nursing, health care and pensions. So it is high time that we put the labour supply in particular in the 
focus of the public debate. We should have learned from the crisis of ten years ago the importance of 
dealing  with  problems  in  time.  If  this  does  not  happen,  they  could  become  seven  times  worse  in  a 
matter  of  years,  when  the  population  trend  has  become  more  markedly  negative.  This  could  then 
require greater, more painful changes under less orderly circumstances. 
Thank you!
