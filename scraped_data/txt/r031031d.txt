I J Macfarlane: Asia’s role in Australia’s economic future 
Tenth  Annual  Sir  Edward  “Weary”  Dunlop  Asialink  Lecture  by  Mr  I  J  Macfarlane,  Governor  of  the 
Reserve Bank of Australia, Sydney, 16 October 2003. 
 I would like to start by thanking the University of Melbourne’s Asialink Centre for inviting me to deliver 
this  lecture  commemorating  such  a  distinguished  Australian  as  Sir  Edward  “Weary”  Dunlop.  It  is  a 
great honour, and I will devote the major part of my lecture tonight to Australia’s economic relations 
with Asia - a theme of which I am sure he would have approved. But before moving on to the main 
topic, I would like to follow normal practice by saying a few words about the person whose memory we 
are  honouring.  In  doing  so,  however,  I  intend  to  follow  up on  a couple  of  unusual  connections  that 
occurred  to  me  as  I  was  preparing  the  lecture.  I  do  not  intend  to  dwell  on  Weary  Dunlop’s 
achievements  or  his  place  in  Australia’s  history  or  folklore.  I  assume  that  everyone  here  tonight  is 
familiar with these.1 
Instead, I ask your indulgence to start by drawing what you may find is a tenuous connection between 
Weary Dunlop and two important economists, one he may or may not have met, the other he certainly 
did meet. 
The first economist was Professor L.F. Giblin, who was Australia’s foremost economist in the inter-war 
period. Since he held a chair in economics at Melbourne University in the 1930s, the two men may 
have  met,  but  there  is  no  record  of  them  having  done  so.  But  if  they  had,  it  would  have  been  an 
interesting meeting because from what we know from their biographies, they had some remarkable 
similarities. Both were big strong men and natural leaders. Both had excellent minds and rose to the 
top of their professions. Both were decorated for their courage in war - Giblin in the first world war, 
Dunlop  in  the  second.  Both  were  outstanding  sportsmen  in  the  same  sport  -  rugby.  If  Dunlop,  the 
Victorian, playing rugby for Australia is a sporting oddity, what of Giblin, the Tasmanian, playing rugby 
for England during his Cambridge days? 
The  connection  with  the  other  economist  of  note  was  only  recently  revealed,  and  I  am  indebted  to 
Professor Leeson of Murdoch University for his excellent detective work. When Weary Dunlop and Sir 
Laurens van der Post, amongst others, were in the Japanese prisoner-of-war camps in Indonesia and 
Thailand,  they  tell  of  the  miniaturised  home-made  wireless  that  they  used  clandestinely  to  keep  up 
with the course of the war. This device had been cobbled together by a fellow prisoner of war - a New 
Zealand  officer  in  the  RAF.  That  officer  we  now  know  was  Flight  Lieutenant  A.W.H.  (Bill)  Phillips,2 
known to economists the world over as the inventor of the “Phillips Curve”. Phillips had been trained in 
New Zealand and Australia as an electrical engineer, had spent time in Asia before the war, spoke 
fluent  Cantonese,  and  only  embarked  on  a  career  in  economics  after  his  discharge  from  the  RAF 
when the war ended. 
Output growth 
Enough of these biographical curiosities. I will now turn to the main subject of my lecture tonight which 
is the role of Asia in Australia’s economic future. I think for most of the past two decades, there was 
general agreement on the importance - if not the primacy - of Asia in Australia’s economic future. But 
this agreement suffered a couple of setbacks in the 1990s. First, Japan, the biggest Asian economy 
and the one which had been the main driving force, fell back into a period of very slow growth at the 
beginning  of  the  1990s.  Second,  the  Asian  crisis  which  started  in  mid-1997  and  lasted  for  about 
18 months, severely dented many people’s confidence in Asia’s future.

Life of Sir Edward Dunlop”, Sue Ebury, Penguin, 1995. 
2  Sir Laurens van der Post refers to him in his book “The Night of the New Moon”. Weary Dunlop also referred to him in his 
published war diaries (entry for 5 November 1942) and confirmed in conversation with Leeson that Bill Phillips was the New 
Zealand RAF officer who built the wireless.

This event - the Asian crisis - had a profound influence on opinion for three or four years. Many people 
saw it as evidence that the “Asian miracle” had feet of clay after all. There was a widespread view 
among western observers that the crisis was the inevitable result of severe governance deficiencies in 
Asian countries, and that these deficiencies would hold back further economic development. During 
the “tech boom” and the period of infatuation with the “new economy” in the late 1990s, perceptions of 
Asia suffered again as its economy was compared unfavourably with more technologically advanced 
western economies, especially the United States. 
We now know that governance deficiencies were not confined to Asia, and that some countries that 
were pointing the finger had governance deficiencies closer to home to worry about. The infatuation 
with  the  “new  economy”  also  resulted  in  a  bubble,  the  bursting  of  which  has  been  exerting  a 
dampening influence on world economic growth for the past three years. We also know that during the 
period when many Asian countries were suffering from the crisis, one important Asian country - China 
- was powering ahead. Now the dust of the Asian crisis has largely settled, it is worth sitting back and 
taking  a  fresh  look  at  Asia’s  place  in  the  world  economy,  and  particularly  its  place  in  Australia’s 
economic future. 
I propose to start this task by looking at the world economy and asking the question - which regions 
are increasing their share of output, and which regions are finding that their share is falling? I will use a 
long-running International Monetary Fund (IMF) data base for the comparisons, the results of which 
are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

No-one should be surprised to find that over the past 20 years Asia’s share of world output has risen 
noticeably, or that the share of the developed OECD countries has fallen. Note that I include Japan in 
the latter group because it is a developed high-income country and as such has been a member of the 
OECD since the 1960s. While much of the rise in the share of Asia is due to China, even when it is 
excluded, the rest of Asia’s share still rises from 7.8 per cent to 12.2 per cent over the two decades. 
In the above comparison, I chose a 20-year period because it gives a good idea of how longer-term 
trends  have  developed.  If  we  instead  chose  the  past  five  years  for  the  comparison,  we  would  be 
choosing  Asia’s  worst  period,  that  is  the  one  that  contains  the  Asian  crisis.  As  a  result,  we  might 
expect to find a different conclusion. But even here, the same picture emerges - Asia’s share of world 
2 
 BIS Review 45/2003
output has risen from 22.3 per cent to 24.9 per cent. It is true that most of this growth is due to China, 
but even without China, Asia’s share rises slightly. Thus, the conclusion is that, whatever time period 
we choose, Asia’s share of world output is rising.3 
Before we leave the tables, it is worth having a look at the performance of OECD countries in more 
detail. Over the 20-year period from 1982 to 2002, there are only two significant OECD countries that 
have increased their share of world output - Australia and the United States.4 I have used this fact 
before to try and cheer up my fellow citizens who for a long time were inclined to assume that we were 
slipping behind. When we shift the comparison to the past five years, Australia still comes out looking 
good. We have increased our position more than any other significant OECD country, and the only 
other ones to show an increase over this shorter period were Canada, Greece, Finland and Spain. 
The general conclusion from these comparisons is that Asia has been, and still remains, the world’s 
fastest  growing  region  and  that  Australia  has  done  well  compared  to  other  high-income  developed 
OECD countries. The two facts are, of course, not independent.

If we take a long enough sweep of history, this should not surprise us. Angus Maddison, who is the favoured authority on 
economic growth over the long run of history, records that in 1820 Asia, excluding Japan, accounted for 56 per cent of world 
output (and China alone, 33 per cent). By 1913, Asia’s share had fallen to 22 per cent, with China down to 9 per cent.

Trade and investment 
But  that  still  leaves  open  a  number  of  questions.  Have  our  exports  become  over-reliant  on  Asia? 
Alternatively,  have  we  kept  up  our  share  of  Asian  imports?  Has  the  closeness  of  our  trade  linkage 
been mirrored in the capital markets? And are we well placed to adapt to future changes in patterns of 
growth, as we appear to have done in the past two decades? These are the questions I will address in 
the remainder of my talk tonight. 
More than half of Australia’s exports go to Asia, and the proportion has not greatly altered over the 
past  two  decades  (Table  3).  It  rose  in  the  1980s  to  peak  at  59  per  cent  in  1996/97,  then  fell  back 
slightly as the Asian crisis had its effects to a figure of 55 per cent in 2001/02. Within this relatively 
stable total, there has been a clear fall in the share going to Japan, and a commensurate rise in the 
share going to non-Japan Asia (NJA). The other thing that stands out is that the share going to China, 
while  clearly  increasing,  is  still  quite  low.  Moreover,  when  we  look  at  these  exports  to  Asia  and 
compare them to the total imports that these economies are taking in, we see that Australia’s share is 
quite small - less than 5 per cent in most cases, and only 2 per cent for China (Table 4). Clearly, there 
is a huge amount of room for expansion here.

One  of  the  major  characteristics  of  the  development  of  Asia  over  the  past  decade  has  been  the 
increase  in  cross-border  interdependence  of  production,  as  China  became  the  centre  for  labour-
intensive  phases  of  manufacturing  using  intermediate  inputs  manufactured  elsewhere,  which  were 
then re-exported as finished manufactures. As a result, there has been a large increase in intra-Asian 
trade, particularly between China and its neighbours. This intra-Asian trade, which is predominantly in 
manufactures, has grown more quickly than trade between Asia and the rest of the world. It mirrors a 
general shift in the trade patterns of developing economies which are now predominantly exporters of 
manufactured  goods.  As  recently  as  1980,  only  25  per  cent  of  the  exports  of  developing  countries 
were manufactures; now the figure is well over 80 per cent - for Asian countries, the figure is likely to 
be over 90 per cent. 
The question for Australia then is whether our exports to Asia are growing as fast as those of other 
countries  into  Asia.  It  is  difficult  to  answer  this  with  precision,  in  large  part  because  of  gaps  and 
inconsistencies in data, but the approximate calculations we have made suggest that our exports are 
keeping up (Graphs 1, 2 and 3). These graphs look at imports into non-Japan Asia and its two biggest 
economies - China and Korea. As already established, the relevant question for us is whether imports 
from Australia are growing as fast as imports from other countries outside the region. The data we 
have  suggest  that  this  is  the  case;  imports  from  Australia  have  grown  faster  than  imports  from  the 
G10 countries.  This  is  less  true  for  China,  where  our  performance  is  more  or  less  in  line  with  the 
G10 countries, but for Korea, imports from Australia have grown a lot faster than their imports from 
G10 countries.

Graph 3 
  As we would probably expect, when we look at the breakdown of Asian imports by category, it is in 
categories such as food, fuels and crude materials that Australia’s performance has been particularly 
strong. Imports of these goods to China and Korea from Australia have grown much more quickly than 
their  total  imports.  Australia  has  been  increasing  its  exports  of  manufactures  into  Asia  as  well, 
particularly to China, but this is from a very small base. Exports of manufactures to China grew at an 
annual rate of 22 per cent over the past five years, but even then they represent only 4 per cent of our 
total manufactured exports. 
In summary, I think these comparisons show that we have been doing reasonably well. Our pattern of 
international trade is strongly integrated into Asia, and apart from a small downward adjustment due to 
the  probably temporary  effects of  the  Asian crisis,  the  trend  is stable.  There  appears  to be  a  lot  of 
upside potential in the trading relationship with China, given our low market share in that country.

 BIS Review 45/2003
When we come to financial integration, however, the story is very different because we do not have a 
high  propensity  to  buy  Asian  financial  assets  (Table  5).  I  have  always  been  struck  by  the  contrast 
between the closeness of our trading relationship with Asia and the lack of closeness in our financial 
integration into Asia. Australian direct investment in Asia, that is owning or having a controlling share 
in  Asian  companies,  has  always  been  relatively  small.  We  have  always  been  more  comfortable 
running businesses in the United States, Europe (especially the United Kingdom) and New Zealand. 
What is perhaps more surprising is that the share of direct investment going to Asia has fallen over the 
past decade, particularly over the most recent five years. During this most recent period, the share of 
our direct investment going to the United States has risen sharply, which is not unique to Australia - 
the strong performance of the US economy during the stock market boom years around the turn of the 
century attracted significant direct investment from all developed economies, and portfolio investment 
from everyone. 
While Asia is a very big player in the world of international trade and is also a major recipient of direct 
foreign investment, it receives very little portfolio investment. Financial markets generally in the region 
are not well developed, and portfolio investment is costly and involves investors taking risks that are 
hard to evaluate. The lack of development is reflected in the low weights for the region in the global 
market indexes which drive so much of the allocation of portfolio investment in the present world: Asia 
accounts for less than 4 per cent of the Morgan Stanley MSCI global equity index - the most widely 
used - and an even smaller share of global bond market indexes. In both cases, the shares are very 
much  lower  than  the  region’s  25  per  cent  share  in  world  GDP.  Needless  to  say,  the  share  of 
Australia’s outward portfolio investment going to Asia is also quite small, accounting for only 10.9 per 
cent of our portfolio investment in 2002.

In  its  foreign  economic  relations,  Australia  has  given  a  very  prominent  place  to  Asia  over  recent 
decades.  As  a  result,  Australia  is  a  member  of  a  range  of  Asian  regional  institutions  aimed  at 
encouraging  growth  and  trade.  We  at  the  Reserve  Bank  are  also  involved  closely  in  a  number  of 
similar groups that bring the central banks of the region together. The main aim of these meetings is to 
find ways of encouraging the growth of Asian financial markets in order to emulate the success of Asia 
in the international goods markets. 
One  concrete  outcome  of  such  co-operation  has  been  the  establishment  of  the  Asian  Bond  Fund, 
through  which  central  banks  in  the  region  (including  the  RBA)  have  invested  some  of  our  foreign 
reserves  in  bonds  issued  by  Asian  governments.  So  far,  the  only  bonds  included  have  been  those 
denominated  in  US  dollars.  In  time,  however,  the  central  banks  of  the  region  hope  to  add  bonds 
issued in local currency into the Asian Bond Fund. We believe that this will help regional bond markets 
develop greater liquidity and become attractive to a broader range of investors. In time, there should 
be an increase in investment flows both within Asia and between Asia and other economies. This is 
likely to see an increase in financial integration, but the process will be a slow one.

The future 
Of course, the global economy does not stand still and we do not know how the recent trends within 
Asia will develop. The story of the rise of China seems likely to have some way yet to run. But I doubt 
that the rise in importance of China, and its impact on Australia, will turn out to be the end of the story 
for Asia because the next chapter will probably contain a greater role for India. In terms of population, 
India is growing at twice the rate of China and fast approaching it in size. It is noteworthy too that India 
is  now  looking  to  the  Asian  region  in  its  trade  policy,  recently  concluding  an  agreement  with 
Association of South Eastern Nations (ASEAN) to eliminate most tariffs within eight years, at the same 
time as ASEAN is eliminating internal tariff barriers and concluding free trade agreements with China 
and Japan. 
If  India  emerges  as  a  second  Asian  engine  of  growth,  Australia  will  face  new  opportunities  and 
challenges. But we are well placed to respond to its increasing demands for imports of food, materials 
and intermediate goods. As with Korea, Australia has had a rising share over the past five years of 
India’s imports of materials. 
We  must  make  sure  that  we  have  the  flexibility  to  respond  to  this  additional  source  of  growth  if  it 
happens, just as we have responded to the shift from Japan to the rest of east Asia and then to China 
over the past two decades. 
Concluding comments 
My main message - the importance of Asia to Australia’s economic future - is not a new one, but it is 
one that people lost sight of for a while. But it will be different in the future in that China will assume an 
increasingly important role, just as Japan did in the 1960s and 1970s. In this sense, China is currently 
the big story, just as India will probably be the next. At the moment, there is great apprehension in the 
rest  of  Asia  about  China’s  rising  dominance.  Countries  that  compete  with  China  as  exporters  of 
manufactures, and recipients of direct foreign investment, feel that they will be overwhelmed. 
I  think  most  people  in  Australia  have  welcomed  the  growing  importance  of  China.  This  is  in  part 
because we do not see China as a competitor because we do not compete with them in low-tech high-
volume manufacturing. We tend to see them as a complementary economy. I do not think we would be 
able to take the same comfort if we had maintained the old heavily-protected manufacturing sector we 
had in the first half of the post-war period. 
This complementarity does not mean that Australia has to see itself as only a provider of resource-
based products from our mines and farms. Manufactured exports to China, while they are small, are 
growing  strongly.  There  is  still  plenty  of  scope  for  the  further  expansion  of  our  high-value-added 
manufacturing and service exports. It is remarkable how much of the growth in international trade is 
intra-industry trade - that is two countries both exporting to each other within the same type of product. 
This is particularly true of manufacturing. 
I  will  conclude  my  talk  tonight  with  two  small  but  concrete  examples  of  how  intra-industry  trade 
between  Australia  and  China  is  developing.  These  examples  are  drawn  from  the  Reserve  Bank’s 
Small  Business  Panel,  a  meeting  we  have  with  small  businesses  originally  designed  to  hear  their 
views about finance, but now covering a wider range of topics. The two examples I will conclude with 
tonight are as follows: 
• 
One member of the Panel, who runs a company producing petrol and diesel driven electricity 
generators, said he was experiencing a lot of competition for small generators from Chinese 
imports. However, he was doing better in the export market and had just won a tender for an 
important export order. When questioned, he revealed that it was for the Chinese army! As 
an  aside,  the  engines  on  his  generators  are  imported  from  Japan  and  Italy.  This  is 
symptomatic of the extent of intra-industry international trade that occurs these days. 
Another Panel member runs a company that installs wooden floors in Victoria using a special 
locking  device  between  the  floorboards.  His  Australian  supplier  stopped  supplying  the 
specially finished floorboards, and so he was forced to look elsewhere. Eventually, he came 
up with a system whereby he ships the bulk wood to Malaysia, they glue and machine it to 
his requirements, and he receives it ready for installation in Australia at 20 per cent below 
the price of his former supplier. He is now exploring the alternative of moving his source of 
supply to China at a probable saving of 50 per cent.
