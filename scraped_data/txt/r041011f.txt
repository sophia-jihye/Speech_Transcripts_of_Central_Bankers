Introduction 
I. 
One of the most critical demographic events in the world today is population ageing i.e., the process 
by  which  the  share  of  older  individuals  in  the  total  population  starts  becoming  larger.  The  ageing 
phenomenon,  which  has  been  initially  experienced  by  developed  countries,  is  now  steadily 
approaching  the  developing  world.  Projections  show  that  over  the  next  five  decades,  world  median 
age will continue to increase, resulting in enhanced old age dependency ratios in all parts of the world. 
Thus,  population  ageing  would  be  a  major  global  public  policy  concern  in  the  twenty-first  century 
posing unprecedented challenges for fiscal, monetary and overall macro-economic management. 
There is a general consensus that ageing population reduces output growth, limits economic welfare 
and lowers employment. One direct effect of population ageing is labour shortages that are caused by 
declining birth rates and increasing life spans. This translates itself into a higher old-age dependency 
ratio (i.e., proportion of population aged 65 and older to population aged 15 to 64). Consequently, with 
ageing,  the  economy’s  capacity  to  sustain  the  elderly  population  would  decline.  An  important 
consequence  of  this  development  is  reflected  in  increasing  fiscal  pressures  through  higher 
government  spending  on  social  security,  health  care  and  other  welfare  programs  for  the  elderly 
accompanied by lower tax buoyancy consequent to falling proportions of the productive labour force. 
Given the hard budget constraint for many developing countries, this could mean lower government 
spending for programs that primarily benefit the young. With public pension schemes coming under 
increasing pressure to raise contribution levels or cut the size of social safety benefits, the issue of 
fiscal sustainability is one of the principal challenges facing policymakers worldwide, particularly in the 
context of intergenerational equity. 
The  experience  of  US,  Western  Europe  and  other  OECD  countries  suggests  that  substantial 
demographic changes have occurred in the past few decades. Improvements in life standards, health 
care and nutrition have increased life expectancy. As a result, the old-age dependency ratio in OECD 
countries  is  projected  to  reach  nearly  50  per  cent  by  2050.  As  has  been  documented  in  this 
symposium, this is going to pose a huge fiscal burden in terms of social security, health care, pension 
and other related expenditures. In this regard, an OECD exercise reveals a rise in old age pension 
spending,  on  an  average,  by  about  3-4  percentage  points  of  GDP  over  the  period  till  2050. 
Expenditure  relating  to  health  and  long  term  medical  care  is  estimated  to  increase  by  more  than 
3 percentage points of GDP over the same period. Overall, total age-related expenditures relative to 
GDP  could  rise  on  average  by  about  7  percentage  points  over  the  period  2000-2050.  In  turn,  this 
would imply an average decline of 6-7 percentage points in the primary balance to GDP ratio. 
The economic impact of the decline in dependency ratios is usually beneficial and is often referred as 
the  ‘demographic  dividend’.  Many  developing  countries  may  temporarily  experience  increase  in 
economic growth in the wake of a declining dependency ratio. Falling birthrates would increase female 
participation  in  the  workforce  thereby  increasing  the  supply  of  labour  resulting  in  higher  economic 
growth. An additional benefit from smaller families is that parents would invest more in the education 
of  children.  Almost  a  third  of  East  Asia’s  growth  in  per  capita  income  between  1965  and  1990  is 
attributed  to  the  demographic  dividend  (Bloom  and  Williamson,  1998).  The  impetus  to  economic 
growth  arising  from  declining  dependency  ratios,  however,  also  depends  on  government  policy. 
However,  many  Latin  American  countries  experienced  declining  dependency  ratios  during  the  past 
40 years without enjoying the rapid economic growth of East Asian countries. It has been argued that 
recurrent financial crises and high trade tariffs in Latin America reduced the size of its demographic 
dividend (Bloom, Canning and Sevilla, 2001). 
Given  the  experiences  of  the  developed  (OECD)  and  Latin  American  countries,  it  is  interesting  to 
compare  those  with  the  emerging  scenario  in  Asia.  At  present,  most  of  the  developing  countries  in 
Asia  are  in  the  middle  path  of  demographic  transition  and  potentially  in  a  favorable  position  on  the 
BIS Review 55/2004

front  due 
to  relatively 
large  working  populations.  This  demographic  dividend  or 
economic 
“demographic  gift”  may  not  last  long  as  the  Asian  population  is  ageing  at  a  faster  rate  than  global 
population with rapid improvement in nutrition and health care (Williamson, 2001). The policy options 
to handle this problem are wide and varied across countries due to them being in different stages of 
the demographic transition. In this context, it is important to examine whether (a) the experience of 
Asia  will  be  similar  to  that  of  OECD  countries  and  (b)  whether  the  policy  stance  of  the  developed 
countries could act as a role model for the developing ones or a unique/country-specific approach is 
required. 
Against the above backdrop, this paper focuses on the potential fiscal challenges of population ageing 
in Asia. The impact of this demographic change is seen primarily from an economist’s (and a Central 
Banker’s) viewpoint. The rest of the paper is as follows. Section II is in the nature of a digression and 
presents  the  conceptual  and  theoretical  issues.  The  main  focus  is  on  review  of  the  literature  on 
ageing, impact on savings, social security and pensions. Section III discusses the demographic profile 
of select Asian countries, excluding Japan and Korea as they are covered under OECD. Section IV 
highlights the impact of ageing on the fisc. The reforms of the pension system and health care carried 
out  by  various  Asian  countries  are  also  covered  in  this  Section.  The  Indian  experience  would  be 
discussed 
fiscal  developments,  changing 
demographic profile, fiscal implications of growing pension payments and pension reforms and health 
care. Section V sets out the policy perspectives in terms of demographic transition including lessons 
drawn from developed countries. Instead of the concluding observations, an approach to Asian ageing 
is presented in Section VI.

Theoretical underpinnings 
Demographic transition and ageing 
Demographic transition is, in general, a process of change where society passes through the stages of 
high fertility and high mortality to low fertility and low mortality. Before the start of the demographic 
transition,  life  was  short,  births  were  many,  growth  was  slow  and  the  population  was  young  (Lee, 
2003).  The  shift  from  high  to  low  levels  of  fertility  and  mortality  has  been  explained  through  the 
different stages in the demographic transition theory. 
The modern transition theory is explained in four stages. In Stage I, the birth rate was very high and 
average longevity of life was short; therefore, population growth was relatively slow and the population 
was  fairly  young.  Significant  medical  advances,  better  health  care  services,  higher  nutritional 
standards over the years have resulted in a drastic decline in mortality in almost all countries and a 
noticeable increase in the longevity of life. With this, the transition enters Stage II. With increase of 
exogenous  survival  rates,  parents’  family-size  decisions  changed  towards  having  fewer  children. 
Besides, fertility rate is also influenced by how economic change influences the cost and benefits of 
childbearing. With the advancement of technology and rapid changes of family structure vis-à-vis the 
opportunity cost of child bearing and rearing, fertility decline follow subsequently and drift downwards 
until it stabilises at a much lower plane. This is technically Stage III of demographic transition. The 
fourth  and  final  stage  of  demographic  transition  refers  to  low  fertility  and  low  mortality  rates.  While 
developed countries are already in Stage IV of demographic transition for more than three decades, 
Asian countries are passing through Stage II/Stage III as evident from their trends in total fertility rates. 
For example, presently while Pakistan is in Stage II, India is in Stage III. 
Low fertility and increasing longevity cause a dramatic change in the population age distribution. An 
increase  in  the  old-age  dependency  ratio  indicates  a  situation  in  which  an  increasing  number  of 
potential  beneficiaries  of  health  and  pension  funds  are  supported  by  a  relatively  smaller  number  of 
potential  contributors.  This  obviously  imposes  heavier  demands  on  the  working-age  population  in 
order  to  maintain  a  stable  intergenerational  flow  of  benefits  to  the  older  people.  Given  the  existing 
social security arrangements and policies, the transition towards more elderly people relative to the 
number  of  workers  will  have  pervasive  effects  on  factor  and  product  markets  and  will  substantially 
impact on public finances, with important distributional implications, both between existing retirees and 
the working age population as well as between current and future generations (Visco, 2001).

Fiscal implications 
The  fiscal  impact  of  ageing  population  is  reflected  through  higher  government  spending  on  social 
security, health care and other welfare programs for the elderly. With public pension schemes coming 
under increasing pressure to raise contribution levels or cut the size of social safety benefits, the issue 
of fiscal sustainability is one of the principal challenges facing policymakers worldwide, particularly, in 
the context of intergenerational equity. In this regard, the literature on social security and pensions has 
assumed critical importance. 
The  principal  rationale  for  mandatory  social  security  programmes  is  that  some  individuals  lack  the 
foresight to save for their retirement years. Since the provision of social security benefits imposes real 
costs  and  acts  as  a  fiscal  burden  on  several  generations,  the  optimal  level  of  benefit  requires 
balancing  between  the  consideration  of  providing  relief  to  the  elderly  and  the  deprived  sections  of 
society while minimizing the costs of distorted real resource allocation (Diamond, 1977). The issue has 
been  compounded  at  the  present  juncture  on  account  of  a  variety  of  factors,  viz.,  (a)  increasing 
proportion of old people, (b) higher degree of urbanisation and greater migration from rural to urban 
areas,  (c)  diminishing  support  for  old  people  from  families  due  to  changes  in  family  structure, 
(d) higher  rearing  cost  of  surviving  children  and  (e)  old  people  require  greater  resources  and  need 
support for a longer period. As such, the key issue is whether such support is provided by private or 
public funding. It may be noted that the inability of private provision implies greater reliance on public 
funding which is a burden on the fisc. 
In the Asian context, this issue is of great relevance as ageing is occurring at lower income levels. The 
redistribution of resources from younger to older generations has to be concerned with the incentive 
for  savings,  keeping  in  view  the  need  for  higher  investment  in  sustaining  the  growth  process.  In 
addition  to  the  redistribution  of  resources  from  young  to  old,  there  also  have  to  be  some  resource 
transfers  from  the  affluent  to  the  less  well  off.  While  the  redistribution  from  young  to  old  has  been 
traditional and would continue as long as possible for those who cannot provide for themselves, the 
transfer of resources from rich to poor affects incentives. One critical difference between developed 
and developing countries is that in the case of the latter, as income growth is higher, pace of change 
in  the  standard  of  living  is  also  high  which  may  be  difficult  to  maintain  in  old  age  on  the  basis  of 
savings accumulated at a younger age. At the same time, since living standards are relatively low in 
developing  countries,  expectations  about  future  standards  of  living  are  lower.  Thus,  more  inter-
generational resource transfers are warranted for developing countries. 
In thinking about the fiscal challenges arising from ageing, the first question that arises is: why these 
problems now? It is true that longevity has increased tremendously in the past few decades, but some 
old have always been with us. What is different now? 
In developing countries, and certainly in India, until recently, the provision for pensions and care for 
the old was essentially privately provided, and usually within the family. Why is this changing now? 
• 
In rural areas, people essentially worked as long as they could. There was no retirement age 
and job content changed according to capacity to work as people aged. 
With  urbanization,  in  the  first  instance,  the  old  people  get  left  behind,  and  remittances 
provide for pension equivalents, encompassing inter generational resource transfers. 
As urbanization proceeds, the issue of outside family provision arises, and is heightened by 
labour mobility. 
Earlier, when the retired were essentially expected to live until the age of 65 to 70, the issue 
of within family care arose for 5 to 10 years. This was a feasible burden for the family. Now 
with rising longevity, the within family care could extend to 20 or even 30 years, and with 
delayed marriage, perhaps throughout the son or daughter’s full working life. This is difficult 
to sustain. 
   Thus, the problems of ageing are upon us in developing countries as well, and certainly in Asia. We 
can clearly expect a shift from private to public provision in the years to come. The issue for public 
policy in Asia is how fast this transition will take place and at what pace should public social security 
and pension provisions be made, with the consequent burdens on already stretched fiscal systems. 
It  has  been  argued  that  the  provision  of  social  security,  particularly  public  pensions,  reduces  the 
inducement  to  save  thereby  having  a  damaging  impact  on  a  country’s  long-term  growth  prospects. 
(Feldstein, 1977) This view has been countered by the multigenerational planning horizon theory of 
BIS Review 55/2004 
 3
Barro  (1978)  which  states  that  people  making  bequests  is  evidence  enough  that  they  derive  some 
benefit from the well being of future generations. Current generations will therefore find that they need 
to save less to finance their own old age, but need to save more in order to increase their bequest 
sufficiently  to  compensate  successive  generations  for  their  tax  liabilities.  These  two  effects  should 
cancel  each  other  leaving  the  savings  rate  unchanged.  This  issue  is  of  particular  importance  for 
developing countries in Asia, which will continue to need high savings for investment and growth for 
quite some time. 
Against the above background, let me now turn to the issues relating to ageing and the consequent 
fiscal challenges in the Asian context. 
Ageing population profile: select Asian country experiences 
III. 
At present, the total fertility rate is below the replacement level in practically all industrialized countries. 
In the less developed regions, fertility decline started later but has proceeded faster than in the more 
developed regions. Over the last 50 years, the total fertility rate (TFR) declined globally by almost half, 
from 5.0 to 2.7 children per woman. Over the next half century, it expected to drop to the replacement 
level of 2.1 children per woman. In this context, it is important to note that Asia is roughly 50 years 
behind  the  developed  nations.  Within  Asia,  a  great  diversity  in  terms  of  demographic  transition  is 
noticeable. 
As per global estimates, currently, the average annual growth of the older population (60+)1 is 1.9 per 
cent,  which  is  noticeably  higher  than  that  of  total  population  at  1.2  per  cent  (Table  1).  More 
significantly,  the  average  annual  growth  rate  of  persons  aged  80  years  and  over  (3.8  per  cent)  is 
currently  twice  as  high  as  the  growth  rate  of  the  population  over  60  years  of  age  (1.9  per  cent). 
Projected figures clearly indicate a much higher growth rate of older people in 25 to 50 years ahead. In 
terms  of  percentage,  the  aged  constituted  8.2  per  cent  of  total  population  in  1950;  this  percentage 
rose slowly to 10 per cent of world’s population in 2000 and is projected to rise to 21.1 per cent in 
2050 (Table 2). During that time, world population of the aged is expected to exceed the population of 
children in the age group 0-14 years (Table 3). 
                                                      
1  Following the UN classification, the ageing indicator has been taken as 60 years and above.

Indian Sub-Continent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka)

East Asian Tigers (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand) 
The  Asian  continent,  with  its  large  size,  wide  socio-economic  and  demographic  disparities  is  better 
understood  and  interpreted  when  studied  at  country  level.  Accordingly,  selected  countries  are 
categorised into three broad groups as indicated below.2
I: 
II: 
III: 
The  young-old  balance  of  population  is  shifting  throughout  the  world.  The  increasing  proportion  of 
aged  people  is  accompanied  by  a  falling  proportion  of  young  persons.  In  developed  countries,  the 
proportion of older persons already exceeds that of children, and by 2050, it is expected to be twice 
that  of  younger  persons.  What  is  notable,  however,  is  that  the  proportion  of  working  age  people  in 
developed countries has been roughly constant over the last 50 years at around 60 per cent (Table 4), 
and  has  in  fact  increased  slightly  with  the  float  over  baby  boom.  The  overall  dependency  ratio  has 
therefore not increased (Table 5). The issue of concern in developed countries is that the proportion of 
working age people is now expected to decline from these levels to about 50 per cent by 2050, with 
the  corresponding  rise  in  dependency  ratios  :  hence  the  heightened  concern  with  ageing  in  recent 
years  in  developed  countries.  What  is  most  dramatic  is  the  expected  rise  in  old  age  dependency 
(i.e., those in the 65+ years age bracket as a proportion of the working age group 15-64 years). In 
developed countries it is around 21 per cent now, rising to 33 per cent by 2025 and as much as 46 per 
cent by 2050 (Table 6).

 BIS Review 55/2004
The trends in Asia over the next 50 years will be more reflective of the past 50 years for developed 
countries,  with  significant  variations  across  different  countries.  The  proportion  of  old  people  in  Asia 
(excluding  Japan  and  Korea)  today  is  around  8.8  per  cent  and  will  reach  22-23  per  cent  by  2050. 
However, similar to the developed country experience of the past 50 years, the working age population 
in Asia is about 60 per cent now; it will rise marginally by 2025 and then fall slightly by 2050. In the 
case  of  China  it  is  now  65  per  cent  and  will  fall  gradually  to  around  55  per  cent  by  2050.  India, 
Indonesia and other Asian countries will remain between 60 and 65 per cent until around 2050. The 
expected increase in old age dependency is also dramatic : from about 9 per cent now to 15 per cent 
in 2025 and 26 per cent by 2050, which would be a little higher than that in developed countries now. 
The Chinese, however, are ageing faster with the old age dependency ratio rising from about 10 per 
cent now to an expected 19 per cent in 2025 and 37 per cent in 2050. For India and Indonesia, the 
rise  will  be  much  slower,  whereas  the  situation  in  Sri  Lanka  and  Thailand  will  be  more  like  that  in 
China (Table 6). 
What  is  really  different  between  developed  countries  and  Asia  is  the  expected  trend  in  total 
dependency ratio (Table 7). The key fiscal problem of developed countries is the unprecedented rapid 
rise  that  is  expected  in  the  total  dependency  ratio  (young + old as a  proportion  of  the working  age 
groups)  from  about  48  per  cent  now  to  57  per  cent  in  2025  and  73  per  cent  in  2050.  In  1950, 
incidentally, it was 54 per cent. For Asia as a whole it was 66 per cent in 1950, 56 now, falling to about 
49 per cent by 2025 and then rising again to 57 per cent by 2050, with differences between countries 
as expected between China and other Asian countries. Countries such as India, Indonesia and others 
will continue to reap the demographic dividend for at least another 25 years.

The  total  dependency  ratio  is  a  rough  measure  of  potential  social  support  needs.3  The  expected 
decline is due to the fact that young-age dependency ratio of all these countries is likely to decrease 
very  rapidly  due  to  sharp  decline  in  total  fertility  rate  during  this  period.  However,  the  decline  of 
young-age dependency ratio during the next 25 years, i.e., 2025-2050 for most of the Asian nations is 
expected to be relatively small. 
In view of the declining dependency ratio in Asia, there is greater room for maneuverability in public 
finances in terms of social security expenditure. A critical issue is the relative emphasis on expenditure 
related  to  the  next  generation  viz.,  child  rearing  and  education  vis-à-vis  expenditure  on  the  earlier 
generation on account of medical and health care. 
Old-age  dependency  ratio  of  China  is  likely  to  increase  by  almost  four  times  during  the  next  half 
century from 10.0 per cent in 2000 to 37.2 per cent in 2050 (Table 6). The other countries likely to 
have  similar  trends  are  Sri  Lanka,  Thailand  and  the  Philippines.  In  the  case  of  India,  old-age 
dependency ratio during 2000-2025 is going to increase by almost 1.5 times (8.1 per cent in 2000 to 
12.2 per cent in 2025); however next 25 years is likely to witness a sharper increase of around 2 times 
(from 12.2 per cent in 2025 to 22.6 per cent in 1950) (Table 7). 
Globally, the ageing index is going to increase rapidly and will triple over the next half century. Higher 
increase in ageing index during 2000-2050 period is more significant for most of the Asian countries 
(see  Table  8).  This  trend  may  lead  to  compelling  demands  for  changes  in  the  way  a  society’s 
resources are shared between generations. The median age of all the Asian countries is expected to 
increase by 12 years during the first half of the current century (see Table 9).

3  However,  it  must  be  recognized  that  the  dependency  ratio  gives  no  more  than  a  rough  approximation  of  the  burden  of 
dependency.  Not  all  young  and  old  persons  require  support,  nor  do  all  working-age  persons  actually  provide  direct  or 
indirect  support.  On  the  contrary,  older  persons  in  many  societies  are  providers  of  support  to  their  adult  children.  Thus, 
although  a  useful  indicator  of  trends  in  the  level  of  potential  support  needs,  the  dependency  ratio,  and  particularly  the 
old-age dependency ratio, should be used cautiously (United Nations 2002).

 Economic characteristic and determinants of ageing 
Labour  force  participation  of  the  older  people  has  declined  worldwide  over  the  last  decades  (see 
Table 10). In general, labour force participation of the older people of Asian countries is much higher 
than  that  of  developed  countries.  However,  disparity  in  labour  force  participation  among  Asian 
countries persists. Higher labour force participation of older ages in Asian countries clearly indicates 
that  old-age  support  systems  in  the  form  of  pension  and  retirement  programmes  are  relatively  less 
prevalent in these countries (as compared to developed countries). 
Fertility  decline  has  been  the  primary  determinant  of  population  ageing.  Fertility  of  more  developed 
countries  with  TFR  is  below  replacement  level  since  the  last  three  decades.  The  TFR  of  less 
developed countries is twice than that of developed countries and this trend is expected to continue till 
2030. The higher regional differences in fertility among Asian countries are expected to decrease (see 
Table 11). The projected fertility transition has been relatively smoother in India and Philippines. These 
countries  are,  therefore,  in  a  favourable  position  (and  thus  may  enjoy  the  fruits  of  ‘demographic 
dividend’ for a relatively longer period) as far as the inflow of working-age populations are concerned. 
Along with fertility decline, reduction in death rate, especially at older ages, assumes an increasingly 
important  role  in  population  ageing.  Over  the  last  five  decades,  life  expectancy  at  birth  increased 
globally by almost 20 years, from 46.5 years in 1950-55 to 66.0 years in 2000-05 (Table 12). Among 
Asian countries, there exists a great degree of variation in life expectancy at birth. However, the extent 
of regional variations in life expectancy at birth among these countries is gradually narrowing down.

 Ageing population and its fiscal impact 
IV. 
In  the  last  decade,  both  the  IMF  (Heller  et  al.,  1986;  Chand  and  Jaeger,  1996)  and  OECD  (1985, 
1988, 1996 and 2001) have carried out a number of studies on the fiscal impact of ageing of major 
industrial countries. An important objective has been to assess, ex ante, the potential impact on public 
expenditure from the provision or financing of social services and transfers. Normally, the base line 
projections  assume  unchanged  social  insurance  legislation  and  social  sector  policies  by  the 
government. Most studies have concluded that, although outlays on education will decline as a share 
of GDP, this will be offset by rapid growth of government outlays on pensions and medical care. For 
most industrial countries, the government social insurance commitments appear inadequately funded. 
Financial sustainability will be achieved only by a combination of cutbacks in benefits or an increase in 
contribution rates. 
Many  Asian  countries  suffer  from  the  chronic  malaise  of  fiscal  imbalances:  expenditures  are  much 
higher than government revenue. As a large section of the population survives at low-income levels, 
the tax base is weak and tax revenues grossly inadequate. Moreover, tax rates are distortionary and 
tax  compliance  is  low.  Current  expenditures  are  high  resulting  in  a  paucity  of  resources  for  capital 
expenditure. Hence, deficits are an enduring feature of many Asian economies. 
Public finance in select Asian countries 
Based on the classification presented in Section II of select Asian countries, it may be noted that the 
average growth (over three years) in the Indian subcontinent was 4.2 per cent with India having the 
highest growth of 5.4 per cent (Table 13). Among all the countries under consideration, China has the 
highest growth of 7.8 per cent. Among the South East Asian Tigers, the average growth is 4.2 per cent 
with Indonesia recording the highest growth of 4.4 per cent and Philippines the least growth of 3.9 per 
cent.

In terms of domestic savings rates, it is noticed that among the four groups, the Indian subcontinent 
has the lowest savings rates on average of about 17.5 per cent. Among these countries, India has 
relatively higher savings rates of 23.8 per cent with Pakistan having the lowest rate of 13.7 per cent. 
Among all the countries, Malaysia has the highest savings rate of 45.3 per cent with China coming a 
close second with 41.0 per cent. The average savings rate of South East Asian countries is around 
30.3 per cent with Philippines having the least rate of 21.0 per cent. Similarly, investment rates are 
very high for China and least for Pakistan. 
On  the  fiscal  side,  the  fiscal  deficit  of the  Government  on  average  seems  to be  the  highest  for  the 
Indian subcontinent (Table 14). The situation in the South East Asian countries is relatively better with 
lower levels of deficit. 
Public expenditure on health and education as a percentage of GDP is among the lowest in the Indian 
subcontinent  (Table  15).  In  this  regard,  it  lags  behind  China  and  many  of  the  South  East  Asian 
counties.  Expenditure  on  education  seems  to  account  for  a  higher  share  in  Malaysia  and  Thailand 
while  expenditure  on  health  draws  greater  attention  in  China.  Although  available  information  on 
pensions  is  dated,  the  pension  burden  seems  to  be  quite  high  for  Malaysia.  All  Asian  countries  in 
general have a low share of pension expenditure in GDP. 
Fiscal impact of ageing 
How  and  when  the  problem  of  ageing  of  Asian  population  manifests  itself  will  have  important 
implications for the structure of the social and fiscal policy choices confronting the Asian economies in 
the coming years. In terms of timing, the countries fall into three principal groups:4 (i) the East Asian 
countries - the most demographically mature and developed in economic terms including Korea and 
Taiwan,  (ii)  South  East  Asia  including  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Philippines  and  Thailand  which  has 
recently experienced significant declines in fertility and increased life expectancy, but where the further 
                                                      
4  Since this categorisation is done from the viewpoint of the fiscal impact of population ageing, this is different from what has 
been followed in Section III.

maturing of these indicators can be expected and where per capita income levels are still relatively low 
compared  to  East  Asia  and  (iii)  China  and  the  Indian  subcontinent,  where  the  ageing  process  is 
occurring somewhat later and which is far less economically developed.

The demographic transition reflected in the ageing population of Asia has resulted from the combined 
effect of successful public health campaigns and rising income levels. An additional consequence of 
these  trends  towards  greater  longevity  and  a  broadly  healthier  population  has  been  that  there  is 
increasingly  a  convergence  in  the  morbidity  and  mortality  profiles  of  the  Asian  population  towards 
those now observed in the industrial economies. These epidemiological trends will create pressures 
for  increased  spending  on  medical  care  in  the  coming  decades.  It  will  enhance  the  impact  of  the 
demographic trends resulting in increasing financial pressure after 2010 in East Asia and somewhat 
later  in  rest  of  the  countries.  In  particular,  India  is  expected  to  face  greater  fiscal  stress  after  2015 
(Lee, 2003). 
In  contrast  to  the  dominant  role  of  governments  in  the  financing  of  the  social  sector  in  industrial 
countries, government commitment is far less comprehensive in Asian countries, with major segments 
of the population not covered by social security and many areas of effective social security are still in 
the  private  domain.  Public  pension  systems  exhibit  considerable  variety  in  Asia,  but  a  principal 
characteristic  is  the  absence  (except  Korea  and  Taiwan)  of  the  kind  of  comprehensive  coverage, 
defined  benefits,  pay-as-you-go  public  pension  systems  observed  in  Western  Europe  and  United 
States. Some countries have introduced provident funds, but these are largely focussed on workers in 
the formal sector. 
The  situation  in  the  medical  care  sector  is  more  varied.  Some  of  the  East  Asian  countries  have 
introduced  comprehensive  and  innovative  health  insurance  reforms,  with  varying  degrees  of  public 
sector  participation,  that  have  attempted  to  nationalize  the  financing  of  medical  care.  In  others, 
medical  insurance  coverage  is  limited  primarily  to  those  in  the  formal  sector,  with  others  in  the 
population  obtaining  medical  care  directly  from  government  hospitals  and  health  centers  or  from 
private  sector  practitioners.  In  education  sector,  the  government’s  involvement  has  focused  on  the 
primary and secondary sectors; its provision of tertiary education has typically been quite limited. This 
suggests that the question of how much additional pressures for government expenditure will emerge 
from the ageing of the Asian population may prove to be a question of whether government policies 
evolve in the direction of expanded coverage and enhanced social insurance policy commitments. 
Health and medical care 
In the context of OECD countries, it has been found that while the medical expenditure for the entire 
population  would  increase  by  6.7  times  between  1986  and  2025,  that  of  the  elderly  population  is 
expected  to  rise  by  10  times  during  the  same  period  (Dhar  Chakraborty,  2004).  If  the  same  cost 
pattern  were  assumed,  there  would  be  a  tremendous  shift  of  resources.  In  the  context  of  Asian 
countries, the main difference is that the problem is likely to be more acute as ageing occurs at lower 
per  capita  income  levels  vis-à-vis  OECD  countries  because  of  the  globalisation  of  public  health 
measures and  the  quality  of  health care.  Moreover,  Asian countries  have  to meet  the  dual  need of 
funding  higher  investment  to  sustain  growth  and  rising  social  expenditure  on  account  of  an  ageing 
population. However, as saving rates are expected to continue to be higher in Asian countries, it may 
not necessarily inhibit the process of capital formation. 
In  most  Asian  countries,  long-term  medical  facilities  cannot  be  met  through  regular  market  service 
providers. Provision of such services through community-based schemes will only add to the financial 
burden. Moreover, old age family care schemes are an additional burden. In addition to the financial 
resources, population ageing is likely to demand a great deal of human resources in terms of doctors, 
nurses  and  other  medical  personnel  and  infrastructure  on  medical  facilities  to  deal  with  an  ageing 
population. Moreover, shift in disease patterns further compound the problem in Asian countries. In 
addition  to  infectious  diseases,  malnutrition  etc.,  Asian  countries  are  also  faced  with  the  growth  of 
non-communicable  diseases,  which  strains  the  already  scarce  resources  to  the  limit.  Therefore, 
considerable  expenditure  on  medical  care  is  required  to  pursue  efficient  and  effective  health  care 
programs to tackle both communicable and non-communicable diseases. 
Reforms 
The  role  of  the  government  in  the  health  and  medical  care  sectors  of  the  Asian  countries  is  quite 
varied. At present, most Asian countries spend about 5 per cent of their GDP on health as compared 
to 14 per cent in the US and other developed countries. Since ageing is not yet a major issue, the 
developing countries of Asia are yet to develop special health care programmes for the aged. Since 
government expenditure on health care is not adequate, most Asian countries have income elasticity 
of health care above one. 
16 
 BIS Review 55/2004
Most of the East Asian countries have introduced health insurance reforms that seek to rationalize the 
financing  of  medical  care  in  order  to  cope  with  the  changing  pattern  of  medical  demand  and  use 
market  principles  to  contain  costs.  The  medical  insurance  programmes  in  Korea  and  Taiwan  have 
nearly  universal  coverage  while  it  is  substantial  in  Singapore.  Funding  is  largely  derived  from  a 
combination of employer and employee contributions, budgetary transfers and direct co-payments by 
patients in both public and private sectors. Although most schemes are formally in the private sector, 
they involve some degree of public regulation or management. However, their financial operations are 
not included in the government’s budgetary accounts. In China, on the other hand, medical insurance 
effectively covers about 20 per cent of the population. Among these, the maximum benefit accrues to 
workers  in  the  civil  service  mainly  in  the  urban  areas.  However,  no  more  than  half  of  the  urban 
population  is  under  a  formal  medical  insurance scheme.  For 75 per  cent  of China’s  population  that 
lived in rural areas, only 5.4 per cent were covered under collectively financed co-operative medical 
care systems in the early 1990s (Hsaio, 1995). 
Among  the  South  East  Asian  Tigers,  government  has  sought  to  provide  medical  services  through 
government hospitals and health centers. Outlays have been financed directly from the budget and, to 
a lesser extent, from user fees. Fiscal restraint has resulted in inadequate medical facilities in urban 
centers and more limited primary care facilities in rural areas. Over time, the private sector has grown 
in significance. Only in Indonesia and Philippines is more extensive medical insurance system being 
gradually  developed.  In  Indonesia,  since  1993,  a  compulsory  health  insurance  scheme  is  being 
introduced gradually for all workers, with contribution paid entirely by employers although the coverage 
is restricted to civil servants and formal sector workers. In the Indian sub-continent, medical insurance 
and health care reforms is at a primary stage with the principal medical facilities located in the urban 
areas. Although there is large contingent of private practitioners, they are mainly city based and the 
per capita availability of medical care in rural areas is quite low. 
The financial effect of ageing populations is significant in the medical care sector. Focusing initially on 
the East Asian countries, which are the most mature in terms of age distribution and health insurance 
system,  demographic  factors  would  suggest  that  gradual  increases  of  about  10  per  cent  might  be 
expected per decade in the ratio of medical expenditure to GDP. While medical expenditure in Korea 
and Taiwan could rise to about 9 per cent of GDP by 2025, China and South East Asia would not have 
a significant impact until at least 2020 (Heller, 1997). In East Asia, government budget outlays would 
rise, on average by only 0.2 per cent of GDP by 2010 with somewhat more substantial increases in the 
successive  decades.  In  China,  pressure  on  government  outlays  would  emerge  after  2020  with  the 
expenditure share  rising  by  less  than 1  per cent  of  GDP  by  2050.  In  South  East  Asia,  government 
medical care outlays as share of GDP would barely change over the next 50 years (Heller, 1997). 
Education 
In Asian countries, the government’s involvement in the education sector has been most extensive in 
terms  of  primary  schooling,  where  enrollment  rates  are  virtually  universal.  It  is  also  the  principal 
provider of secondary education, though here the private sector plays a more significant role in some 
countries (notably, Indonesia, Korea and India). Secondary enrollment rates which typically range from 
40-75 per cent while high by developing country standards, are significantly below the average rates 
of  86  per  cent  observed  in  more  developed  countries.  Government  involvement  is  far  lower  in  the 
tertiary  sector  (with  the  exception  of  Korea).  Private  sector  involvement,  either  through  private 
universities (so-called long distance training), or the acquisition of education at overseas universities, 
is far more common at this level. 
The absolute size of the school age population is projected to grow by a limited extent in South East 
Asia  (Heller,  1997).  In  China  and  East  Asia,  this  group  will  fall  in  size  suggesting  the  possibility  of 
some fiscal savings. Since public spending on education is typically 2-4 per cent of GDP, it is plausible 
that  reductions  in  government  expenditure  are  non-trivial.  Projections  suggest  that  government 
expenditure  on  education  could  fall  by  about  one  per  cent  of  GDP  by  2010  with  more  modest 
reductions thereafter by 2025. In China, only modest reduction in government educational spending - 
less than 0.4 per cent of GDP will be observed through 2010 and only slightly by 2025 and thereafter. 
If enrollment rates in higher education were to increase to 20 per cent, overall government outlays on 
education is likely to increase. Overall, the potential reduction in education expenditure may be muted 
because  of  the  elongation  of  time  spent  in  education  and  greater  emphasis  on  technical  and 
professional education, improvement in the quality of education, all of which will be very necessary for 
the productivity growth that is necessary for economic growth and improved standards of living in Asia.

Public pension system5
Perhaps the most significant impact of population ageing is on the pension system, in particular, and 
on the fiscal situation, in general. The choice of policies for stabilizing the fiscal situation is therefore 
important, especially if the governments decide to pursue a somewhat faster pace of consolidation to 
reduce its exposures to fiscal risks. While one option is to shift towards fully funded pension liabilities 
and more generally encouraging a diversified range of retirement income sources, another option is 
modifying public pension generosity and eligibility criteria by elongating the average numbers of years 
in the work force or service. In this regard, the pension reforms have taken the form of both structural 
and parametric changes. The reforms in many countries have focused on the more from unfunded to 
funded  arrangements  in  order  to  address  the  issue  of  growing  pension  liabilities.  This  has  led  to 
creation  of  large  sized  pension  funds  necessitating  appropriate  institutional  frameworks  to  ensure 
safety of invested funds. 
Public  pension  systems  exhibit  considerable  variety  among  the  Asian  countries.  Only  Korea  and 
Taiwan have defined benefit, pay-as-you-go, public pension systems with largely universal coverage 
of the workforce. Taiwan’s scheme (which was expanded in 1983) results in a lump-sum benefit upon 
retirement, in contrast to Korea’s more recently introduced scheme, which will result in a retirement 
annuity.  Coverage  is  relatively  comprehensive  for  the  mandatory  provident  funds  of  Malaysia  and 
Singapore.  These  are  defined  contribution  schemes  which  result  largely  in  lump  sum  withdrawal 
benefits  upon  retirement,  but  which  allow  earlier  withdrawals  for  specified  purposes  (e.g.,  higher 
education  for  dependents,  major  medical  expenses,  housing).  The  latter  schemes  are  subject  to 
government regulation or management (in terms of governance provisions and investment policies). 
The  provisions  of  the  systems  suggest  that  the  principal  risks  of  inadequate  savings  (due  to 
unanticipated  inflation,  poor  yield  on  savings,  or  longer-than-expected-life  spans)  are  almost  wholly 
borne by the contributing populations (Heller, 1997). 
In the other Asian countries, the government’s involvement in the pension sphere is presently much 
more limited, although some countries are considering or have recently implemented pension reforms 
that seek either to introduce new pension schemes or to strengthen the finances of existing schemes 
(e.g., in Indonesia). Public pension systems, if they exist at all beyond the civil service, are typically 
restricted to the larger enterprises in the formal sector. Thus, overall public pension coverage of the 
labor force is still fairly limited and replacement rates are low. Where such schemes exist, they are 
managed  by  public  enterprises,  and  are  financially  not  included  in  the  central  government  budget. 
Private  sector  pension  systems  exist  for  the  larger  enterprises  of  some  countries  (notably  China, 
Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand), and most of these are in the form of provident funds. 
There  are  few  estimates  of  the  impact  of  demographic  trends  on  the  pension  outlays  of  the  Asian 
economies.  For  those  countries  where  pension  coverage  is  relatively  comprehensive,  long-term 
actuarial projections are available for some of the pension schemes and these indicate the financial 
pressures  to  which  they  may  be  subjected.  In  Korea,  for  example,  actuarial  projections  show  the 
emergence  of  operating  deficits  in  the  National  Pension  Fund  as  early  as  2020  or  sooner.  For  the 
provident fund-type schemes of Singapore and Malaysia, projections suggest that the ageing of the 
population will also result in a net draw down on fund reserves. To the extent that these funds are 
classified  in  the  private  sector,  these  draw  downs  would  have  no  impact  on  measured  government 
fiscal balances (Heller, 1997). 
For other Asian Tigers, most of the public sector pension schemes cover only a limited share of the 
labour force. Thus, most long-term financial projections, where available, focus on the demographics 
of the specific work process associated with particular pension schemes and on the terms of eligibility 
for  benefits  in  these  schemes.  The  few  available  financial  projections  suggest  the  exhaustion  of 
built-up  reserves  within  the  next  decade  or  so,  and  mounting  operating  deficits  thereafter.6  In  the 
absence of the governments being drawn into their financing, the deficits of these schemes would, in 
principle, need to be financed either by higher contribution rates from future workers or by cutbacks in 
                                                      
5  The discussion in this Section draws on Heller (1997) and West (1999). The Indian experience is drawn from various reports 
on pension reforms. 
In China, the pressures begin to emerge in 2010, but become particularly severe after 2025. In Indonesia, the civil service 
pension scheme begins to operate in deficit after 2006 (Asher 1997), and the pressures are further exacerbated by liabilities 
with  respect  to  post-retirement  health  costs.  In  Korea,  operating  deficits  emerge  after  2020,  ultimately  eliminating  the 
financial reserves that will have been accumulated. In Thailand, civil service pension deficits begin to emerge in 2020 and 
reserves have been projected to deplete by about 2027 (Heller, 1997).

benefits. Obviously, developments in the size and demographic structure of the overall population are 
not  useful  for  assessing  the  potential  pressures  on  public  outlays  from  these  pension  schemes. 
Indeed,  one  may  observe  operating  deficits  emerging  in  schemes,  even  where  the  overall 
demographic data for a country would not suggest any particular pressure in terms of rising overall 
elderly dependency rates. 
An  alternative  perspective  on  the  implications  of  demographic  change  can  be  gleaned  by  a  simple 
assessment  of  the  effect  of  an  increase  in  the  size  of  the  elderly  population  rate  on  gross  public 
pension outlays (Heller, 1997). In East Asia, through 2010, the effects on government pension outlays 
are modest (1-2 percent of GDP), with the largest impact felt in Korea and Taiwan, and with far more 
limited  effects  in  Singapore  and  Hong  Kong,  China.  Outlays  in  Taiwan  and  Korea  could  also  rise 
substantially, by about 4 per cent of GDP between 2010 and 2025. By 2035, these expenditure shares 
could further increase, as the elderly dependency rate becomes larger. Indeed, by 2050, one could 
observe pension outlays increasing by 8-11 per cent of GDP in Korea and Taiwan relative to 1995 
levels. 
In  China,  the  budgetary  effects  only  emerge  between  2010  and  2025,  but  still  remain  modest,  with 
additional  outlays  of  about  2  per  cent  of  GDP  between  1997  and  2025.  Thereafter,  however, 
demographic factors alone could increase government pension outlays by 5 per cent of GDP by 2035. 
For the South East Asian Tigers, again the budgetary impact would be negligible for most countries 
(an increase under 1 per cent of GDP by 2025 and 2 per cent by 2035), with the significant exception 
of Malaysia. 
The implications of enhancing pension coverage 
Beyond the obvious differences across countries as to when the elderly dependency rate will become 
burdensome,  the  key  factor  determining  the  impact  on  outlays  are  differences  in  the  scale  of  the 
government’s  budgetary  involvement  in  the  pension  sector.  However,  the  statistics  also  implicitly 
suggest  significant  differences  across  economic  groups  within  a  country  in  terms  of  their  claim  on 
formal  pension  incomes  during  retirement.  The  populations  not  covered  under  such  schemes  are 
typically  those  in  the  informal  and  rural  sectors  who  are  almost  wholly  reliant  on  intra-household 
transfers and savings. They are likely to be far more vulnerable to the financial risks of ageing. 
Were the governments of these countries to play a more active role in the pension sphere in terms of 
ensuring some minimal pension to all uncovered elderly, government pension outlays could become 
more substantial. For example, if in 2025, the government were to pay a pension equal to 30 per cent 
of per capita income to each elderly person not covered under existing public pension schemes, then 
government pension outlays would rise significantly. In China, a further increase in outlays of 1.7 per 
cent of GDP would be required as early as 2010, and the pressure on pension outlays would become 
increasingly  heavy.  In  South  East  Asia,  outlays  would  be  higher  than  in  the  previous  projection  by 
about 1-1.5 per cent of GDP by 2010, with further additional increase thereafter. 
Two broad sets of issues are clearly on the public policy agenda. First, where existing schemes for 
public enterprise employees and civil servants (e.g., in China, Indonesia, India, Thailand) have been 
shown to be actuarially in need of remedial financial measures, the issue is whether the government 
will adapt these schemes to forestall such a situation or ultimately absorb the cost of operating deficits. 
Second, and more important, are the problems posed by the ageing of the populations of the South 
East Asian Tigers and China, with reduced support ratios in terms of the number of workers relative to 
the  elderly  population,  and  an  increasing  breakdown  of  traditional  extended  family  support  systems 
(particularly in the context of significant rural-urban migration and declining fertility rates). Will these 
societies decide to provide a more orgnaised financial framework for income support for the elderly 
than would emerge from voluntary household savings decisions and extended family support? To a 
significant extent, this is a distributional question. The policy choices made in this regard will have both 
fiscal  and  macroeconomic  implications;  both  in  the  period  before  and  after  the  elderly  become  an 
increasing  share  of  the  population.  The  choices  will  also  determine  the  way  in  which  the  financial 
pressures from an ageing population are distributed within the societies. 
The Indian scenario 
The case for fiscal consolidation in India is very strong given that the existing nominal debt to GDP 
ratio  is  already  very  high  compared  to  other  emerging  market  economies.  The  burden  is  further 
aggravated  when  unfunded  pension  liabilities,  contingent  liabilities,  government  guarantees  of  state 
BIS Review 55/2004 
 19
enterprise  debts,  and  the  prospects  of  re-capitalisation  of  a  number  of  state  owned  financial 
institutions is taken into account. The combined fiscal deficit has been around 10 per cent of GDP in 
recent  years.  The  challenge  facing  India  therefore  is  a  renewed  focus  on  fiscal  consolidation  as  is 
embedded in the objectives of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act that has been 
enacted recently. As the fiscal challenges arising from ageing will take some time to become evident, 
the opportunity of strengthening the fisc is new and needs to be pursued with great resolve. 
An  overview  of  the  combined  finances  of  the  Central  and  State  governments  shows  some 
improvement in 2003-04 on account of a lower growth rate in aggregate expenditure vis-à-vis non-debt 
receipts. The combined tax-GDP ratio registered an improvement of 0.5 percentage points over the 
previous year’s level. Direct and Indirect taxes registered improvements over the previous year’s level; 
the improvement in direct taxes was, however, more pronounced as a proportion of GDP. There was 
also qualitative improvement in expenditure composition in 2003-04 as reflected in a shift in favour of 
the  developmental  component.  In  terms  of  GDP,  the  development  expenditure  of  the  Centre  and 
States exhibited an improvement of one percentage point over the previous year. The share of capital 
outlay  in  the  total  expenditure  showed  an  improvement  in  2003-04  by  2.6  percentage  points. 
Containment  of  non-developmental  expenditure  was  made  possible  through  reductions  in  interest 
payments on account of the softening of interest rates enabled by the conduct of monetary policy. The 
impact  of  the  lower  interest  rates  got  reflected  in  the  decline  in  the  ratio  of  interest  payments  as  a 
proportion of revenue receipts. 
India  is  undergoing  the same  forces  of  demographic  transition  that  have been  experienced  in  most 
other  parts of  the  industrial  and  emerging  market world,  delayed  by  a  few  decades.  Population  will 
continue to grow in the next 50 years, albeit at a lower rate. The age structure will change dramatically 
with  a  doubling  of  the  share  of  ageing  population.  In  fact,  India’s  population  structure  will,  in  2050, 
mirror that presently found in the major industrial countries. 
Fortunately,  from,  the  fiscal  point  of  view,  unlike  in  industrial  countries,  India  does  not  have  a 
“Beveridgean”  social  insurance  system  in  place.  Thus,  India’s  demographics  do  not  necessarily 
portend  explosion  in  government  social  insurance  outlays  arising  from  underlying  existing  policy 
commitments. This being the case, the demographics still pose important challenges on social security 
for the government. 
India’s demographics have important ramifications for the approach taken to the provision of medical 
care  and  the  structure  of  India’s  evolving  social  insurance  policy  framework.  Although,  they  do  not 
necessarily imply a dramatic expansion in the size of the government health care system, the need for 
a substantial strengthening of both this system and the regulatory framework in the sector cannot be 
over  emphasised.  Even  without  a  national  health  insurance  scheme,  the  level  of  primary  care 
expenditure is grossly insufficient and would require at least a doubling of the share of this expenditure 
in  GDP  by  2010  (Heller,  2004).  Moreover,  with  an  increasingly  affluent  population,  the  demand  for 
medical care is expected to rise sharply. 
Beyond the aggregate demographics of a country, the actuarial position of public and private pension 
schemes is primarily determined by a combination of the demographics of the insured population of 
the scheme and the nature of the policy parameters of the particular pension scheme. In the case of 
India, only about 11 per cent of the current working age population participate in mandatory, formal 
programmes designed to provide income security during old age. The participants in these schemes - 
salaried  employees  in  the  formal  private  sector  and  government  -  are  among  the  highest  income 
groups in India. These schemes do not extend to nearly 85 per cent of workers in the informal sector 
who  have  little  ability  or  opportunity  to  save  for  old  age.  The  formal  programmes  consist  of  three 
funded  programs,  two  of  which  are  of  a  defined-contribution  nature  (viz.,  the  Employees’  Provident 
Fund  (EPF)  for  formal  private  sector  employees  and  the  government-wide  provident  fund  -  the 
Government  Provident  Fund)  and  one  which  is  a  defined-benefit  scheme  (the  Employees’  Pension 
Scheme (EPS). There is also one unfunded programme - the Civil Servants Pension Scheme (CSPS), 
which is a non-contributory, pay-as-you-go pension system administered by both the central and state 
governments. For two of the schemes, the CSPS and EPS, the government is likely to face significant 
long run contingent liabilities. The situation is difficult in the case of central government departments’ 
viz., defence and railways. The pension bill is estimated to be about 25 per cent above the wage bill, 
which represents a hidden cost. 
Although, the EPS is, in principle, funded, it is unlikely that it is going to be financially sustainable in 
the  long  run  as  its  defined  benefit  promises  too  high  a  rate  of  return  on  contributions.  This  rate  of 
return  is  well  beyond  the  feasible  rate  under  the  current  restrictive  investment  regulations  and 
20 
 BIS Review 55/2004
approximates the rate that can be expected from a well - diversified portfolio in the most advanced 
financial  markets.  Increasing  coverage  simply  increases  the  number  of  the  workers  accruing 
unaffordable  benefits.  As  interest  income  and  lump  sum  withdrawals  from  provident  funds  is  tax 
exempt, tax preferences in the current pension system add to the strain on government finances. 
This problem is further compounded by administered interest rates on small savings, which are not in 
sync  with  market  interest  rates.  While  increasing  attention  was  given  by  the  monetary  authority  to 
explore  alternative  means  of  reducing  the  interest  rate  rigidities,  sharp  reductions  in  interest  rates 
since  2001  following  strong  capital  inflows  raised  concern  about  protecting  real  interest  income  of 
retirees  and  pensioners,  particularly  in  view  of  inadequate  coverage  of  social  safety  net  in  India. 
Therefore, while benchmarking of interest rates may be an interim solution, a medium term objective 
could be to design fully funded pension schemes over a period of time to be independently managed 
by professional trustees with returns linked to the underlying assets of the Fund. In order to address 
the  immediate  concerns  of  savers,  it  is  necessary  to  limit  the  inter-year  movement  of  interest  rate 
fluctuations  within  tolerable  levels.  In  fact,  these  concerns  supersede  the  need  for  aligning  the 
administered interest rates to market rates. Further, it is also envisaged to offer a higher interest rate 
to Senior Citizen / Pensioners by benchmarking those securities with G-sec of longer tenor and adding 
a spread over the benchmark (Government of India, 2004). 
A  cursory  review  of  India’s  social  insurance  framework  (Box  1)  suggests  enormous  gaps,  both  in 
coverage and in the regulatory structure. Unemployment insurance basically does not exist, adding to 
the factors that have made it difficult for enterprises to rationalise work forces. In the health sector, 
most of the population is covered at best by a limited and poorly staffed public health service. As a 
consequence,  the  bulk  of  health  care  is  provided  by  the  private  sector.  And  finally,  as  discussed 
above, the various formal retirement savings schemes cover no more than about 11 per cent of the 
labour  force  (Heller,  2004).  Looking  ahead,  India  will  need  to  develop  a  framework  for  provision  of 
mechanisms for social insurance consistent with a modern economy. While the private sector has to 
play  an  important  part  in extending social  security  services,  there  has  to  be  a  dominant  role  of  the 
public sector in both regulation of the private sector and in the targeting of the poorest groups.

OASIS (Old Age Social and Income Security) 
The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India had commissioned a national Project 
tilted “OASIS” (Old Age Social and Income Security) in 1999 to examine policy questions connected with old 
age  income  security  in  India  and  create  necessary  institutional  infrastructure  and  to  make  concrete 
recommendations for actions. The committee, which submitted its Report in February 1999, was entrusted with 
the  twin  task  of  further  improving  existing  provisions,  and,  to  devise  a  new  pension  provision  for  excluded 
workers  who  are  not  capable  of  saving  even  modest  amounts  and  converting  this  saving  into  an  old  age 
income security provision. Major recommendations of the Committee were: 
To develop an institutional infrastructure, through which individuals can prepare for old age while they are in 
the labour force, is an efficient pension system. As most individuals in India are outside the organised sector 
and  face  temporary  unemployment,  a  pension  system  for  India  should  thus  be  flexible  and  useful  to  the 
unorganized sector. Government dole is not sustainable on a significant scale and old age economic security 
should  necessarily  result  from  sustained  lifelong  contributions  by  emphasizing  self-help  and  thrift,  and  for 
sound  pension  planning,  there  should  be  sound  fund  management  to  achieve  the  highest  possible  rates  of 
return. 
The  Committee  recommended  a  simple  and  convenient  pension  system  where  a  person  opens  a  single 
Individual Retirement Account (IRA) at as early a point in his life as possible with a minimum of Rs. 100 per 
contribution and Rs. 500 in total accretions per year. No limit on the frequency of accretions or fixed monthly 
contribution. 
The pension system would work through a myriad Points of Presence (POPs), which would be located all over 
India  including  banks’  branches,  post  office,  etc;  with  full  portability  across  job  changes  and  across 
geographical  locations.  It  would  be  a  two-tier  system  where  POPs  with  good  information  technology  and 
telecommunications  facilities  would  offer  better  services  than  other  technologically  constrained  POPs  and  in 
turn would reduce administrative and transactions costs. 
Six professional pension fund managers (PFMs) should be selected to manage the retirement funds under this 
system. The pension system would offer three styles - Safe Income, Balanced Income and Growth. Each of the 
six  PFMs  would  run  one  scheme  each  in  the  three  styles,  giving  18  schemes  in  all,  which  individuals  can 
choose from. 
 BIS Review 55/2004 
 21
Box 1 (cont) 
OASIS (Old Age Social and Income Security) 
An additional safety net in the pension system is that if the final pension of a participant is smaller that the sum 
total  of  all  contributions  then  the  insurance  cover  would  reimburse  this  difference  for  individuals  who  have 
contributed for at least ten years. To a significant extent, the Government can purchase this insurance from 
insurance companies. 
The  design  of  the  pension  system  should  also  include  a  Self  Regulatory  organization  (SRO)  that  will  be 
registered with the Indian Pension Authority. The pension system relies on annuity providers who convert the 
lump sum of assets (attained at retirement) into a regular monthly pension (or a variable annuity) until death. 
The  tax-free  limit  for  accretions  into  the  IRA  should  continue  to  be  a  maximum  of  Rs. 60,000  per  annum. 
Premature withdrawals as well as the terminal accumulations withdrawn as a lump sum from Provident Funds 
should  be  taxable  at  the  rate  of  long-term  capital  gains  rate.  However,  the  amount  that  is  used  for  buying 
annuities should be tax-free. 
The income earned on Funds held in trust by PFMs and annuity providers, on behalf of contributors, should be 
exempt from any taxes. There is a strong case for integrating a micro-credit facility into the pension system 
whereby individuals can have access to funds in the form of a loan against their pension savings. 
 
The enduring message for Asian countries, based on the experience of developed countries, is that 
dependency  and  its  concomitant  fiscal  impact  is  not  necessarily  towards  old  age  but  also  for  the 
younger generation. While the expenditure on education can be funded by private provisions, that of 
health and medical care of older people are likely to come from public spending on social security. 
Thus, ageing poses serious challenges on the fisc, which require immediate policy responses. In this 
regard,  public  pension  reforms  and  health  insurance  would  play  a  key  role  in  alleviating  the  fiscal 
burden. 
Policy response and lessons from developed countries 
V. 
Population ageing has many serious developmental linkages with a potential to jeopardize economic 
and planning strategies. Normally, the subject is viewed as a problem in the very long run; therefore, 
policy  initiatives  receive  only  peripheral  attention.  However,  while  addressing  the  magnitude  and 
timing of the adverse demographic fallout, there is a need to reflect on the likely direction and effects 
of critical policy choices in the social sectors, many of which initially have only a limited relationship 
with long run demographic pressures. These pressures later will eventually play an important role in 
determining longer-term fiscal effects. In reflecting on the options faced by the Asian countries, it is 
useful  to  look  at  the  debate  in  industrialized  countries,  where  the  focus  has  largely  been  on  three 
broad sets of options. These are: 
(1) 
Measures for fiscal consolidation in the period before the full impact of ageing commences, 
thus  improving  the  base  level  of  national  savings  and  public  debt.  Actions  to  lower 
expenditures and raise primary budget surpluses in the non-age sensitive areas of budgets 
are clearly seen as strengthening this fiscal position. 
Fundamental  changes  in  policy  design,  particularly  in  the  health  and  pensions  sphere,  in 
order to contain the cost of the public sector’s social insurance commitment to the elderly 
population and to contain systemic cost-augmenting pressures in the medical sector; and 
Measures designed to at least partially redress the influence of demographic trends on the 
workforce and thereby enhance growth rates and the government’s revenue potential. 
(2) 
(3) 
The position of the Asian economies in the face of these choices of policy design in the key social 
sector differs in some important respects. For the industrial countries, the scope for significant policy 
changes  is  restricted  by  the  maturity  of  their  pension  and  health  systems  and  the  consequent 
difficulties of changing them. In contrast, the social service systems of many of the Asian countries are 
still in a formative stage. This is particularly true for India and China, where fundamental reforms to 
both the health insurance and pension systems are now under consideration. 
There  are  both  advantages  and  disadvantages  in  this  situation.  On  the  one  hand,  the  problem  of 
ageing is a bit premature for many Asian economies (e.g., India, Pakistan, Bangladesh) while for some 
it is getting too late (e.g., Korea, China). There is need to ensure that stable systems are put in place 
by the early part of this century but at the same time these systems have to be sufficiently flexible and 
22 
 BIS Review 55/2004
moderate  in  their  commitments  on  pension  benefits.  Secondly,  in  designing  present  policies,  the 
longer  term  demographic  developments  have  to  be  borne  in  mind  although  there  may  be  more 
pressing  fiscal  problems  at  hand.  Third,  in  view  of  the  rapid  pace  of  transformation  of  an  ageing 
population,  there  is  a  need  for  policy  makers  to  adequately  modulate  the  speed  of  adjustment  of 
reforms.  Finally,  although  policy  strategies  are  highly  reliant  on  private  sector  initiatives,  the  public 
sector has to play an important role in overcoming sources of market failure. 
Many  of  the  issues  that  will  confront  public  policy  makers  are  essentially  distributional  in  character 
e.g., should there be a minimal income level for the elderly and who should finance such transfers. 
There  has  to  be  some  reassessment  of  the  generosity  of  some  existing  pension  schemes  and 
measures to alleviate the gender bias inherent in some pension schemes. In the area of medical care, 
policies have to address the issue whether access to medical care should be governed by financial 
ability. Finally, the question of whether to broaden social security coverage beyond the formal sector to 
the  informal  economy,  the  rural  sector,  the  foreign  workers  communities  will  be  a  significant  policy 
issue for most of the Asian countries during the next few decades. 
In terms of allocation of scarce resources, expenditure within the social sectors need to be prioritized 
to take account of the changing structure and level of demand in education and medical sectors. While 
some  levels  of  education  need  to  see  expansion  others  will  need  downsizing.  Similarly,  medical 
facilities have to be upgraded which calls for heavy capital outlays. 
One issue that will influence social insurance system design is the capacity of the government or the 
private sector to extend the administration of collections of payroll-related contributions or taxes to the 
rural and urban informal sectors of the economy. The administrative complexity of taxing or realizing 
mandatory contributions from such groups will thus inevitably bias policy choices away from the notion 
of benefit systems that are tied to individual contributions and more towards the provision of publicly 
financed  services  in  the  medical  care  sector  and  rough  means-tested  safety  net  transfers  for  the 
elderly.  In  effect,  cross  subsidization  from  the  general  taxpayer  to  these  groups,  which  are  not  an 
insignificant  share  of  the  population,  may  be  inevitable  for  the  foreseeable  future  in  Asia. This  may 
reinforce  the  bias  toward  dualistic  systems,  which  effectively  differentiate  between  workers  in  the 
formal and informal sectors. Allowing for optional participation in public pension and private or public 
medical insurance schemes is also an obvious option, but does not address the fundamental difficulty 
of limiting the extent to which there is a segmentation of the population in terms of the standard at 
which pension and medical care needs are addressed. 
A  second  issue  is  whether  the  Asian  countries  need  to  alter  their  fiscal  stance  in  light  of  emerging 
demographic trends. In the pension sector, this would imply whether it would be desirable to prefund 
higher  outlays  associated  with  pension  as  in  Singapore  and  Malaysia  or  as  with  Medisave  in 
Singapore for medical care. Ultimately the question relates to whether a higher national savings rate is 
desirable, and the extent to this should be an explicit goal of policy. This is particularly true for East 
Asia  where  the  aggregate  and  public  sector  savings  rate  are  quite  high  and  where  even  higher 
investment  rates  have  fuelled  higher  economic  growth  and  rising  per  capita  income.  For  the  less 
developed Tigers, the financial implications of ageing population are less daunting for the foreseeable 
future. For these countries, achieving high rates of savings would appear an important policy objective, 
but more so in order to achieve the rapid growth necessary for raising per capita income levels. In 
effect, achieving rapid growth is one form of “prefunding”. 
Yet another issue is the availability of life insurance and private pension schemes in Asian countries. 
Asian countries, particularly in the Indian subcontinent, suffer from scarcity of capital, which restricts 
their  capacity  for  large  capital  outlays  in  infrastructure.  Pooled  savings  of  pension  and  insurance 
schemes  can  be  channelised  for  productive  investments  thereby  increasing  the  potential  for  higher 
growth. Higher growth would enable higher investments in social security, as the scope of additional 
mobilisation of resources through higher taxes is limited. These measures would facilitate the burden 
of  an  ageing  population  without  inhibiting  the  development  process  while  maintaining  inter-
generational equity. 
In  order  to  postpone  the  burden  of  pension  funding,  another  policy  option  may  be  to  increase  the 
retirement  age  for  existing  employees  (e.g.,  Japan)  thereby  keeping  elderly  people  employed  for  a 
longer period. In this regard, incentive schemes for early retirement may be withdrawn or discontinued. 
However,  while  this  may  be  a  feasible  solution  in  developed  countries  with  low  growth  rates  of 
population,  such  measures  in  Asian  countries,  experiencing  high  population  growth,  would  result  in 
increased unemployment, as more job seekers would remain unemployed for a longer duration.

Pension reforms 
In the context of growing pension liabilities, several countries have initiated modifications in the civil 
service pension schemes. Many countries have, accordingly, taken measures to reduce the pension 
liabilities  by  introducing  higher  retirement  ages  and  /or  longer  service  periods;  increasing  required 
employee  contribution  rates;  lowering  rates  of  benefit  accrual;  and  changing  the  post  retirement 
indexation policy. Illustratively, Korea has increased the employee share of contribution, shifted from 
wage  to  price  indexation,  and  reduced  the  benefit  levels  to  new  employees.  Italy  also  shifted  from 
wage to price indexation and introduced limitations on early retirement. Brazil, Greece and Portugal 
have  also  reduced  the  benefit  accrual  rates.  A  number  of  countries  have  also  realised  the  need  to 
achieve some level of advance funding of benefit obligations. 
Pension reforms being undertaken by various countries follow different forms. The multi-pillar system 
adopted in several countries consists of an unfunded mandatory pillar, a funded mandatory pillar, and 
a voluntary private pillar. The design of the pillars has varied across the countries. There are, however, 
three major types of pension reforms across the world. At the one end of the spectrum is the Latin 
American (individual account) model, with only one DC pillar established by Chile in 1980 and now 
followed by Argentina, Mexico, Peru, Bolivia and Uruguay. While the other two models are the OECD 
(employer sponsored) model adopted by Australia, Switzerland, Denmark, and the United Kingdom, 
and the notional defined contribution (NDC) system which originated in Sweden and adopted in Italy, 
Latvia and Poland. 
Given the wide variety of demographic experience in Asia, the sequencing of pension reforms has to 
be in sync with the changing profile of dependency ratio while addressing the fiscal challenges and 
this  needs  to  be  seen  from  an  overall  perspective.  In  this  regard,  pension  reform  in  two  Asian 
countries viz. India and China is discussed briefly. 
India 
In  India,  initiatives  towards  pension  reforms  have  been  somewhat  nascent  at  both  the  Central  and 
State Government level (Box 2 & 3). 
 
New pension system for the Central Government of India 
Box 2 
In  February  2002,  the  High  Level  Expert  Group  on  New  Pension  System  submitted  its  report  suggesting 
modifications  in  the  pension  system  for  Central  Government  employees.  In  August  2003,  the  Union 
Government  approved  the  proposal  to  implement  the  budget  announcement  of  2003-04  relating  to  the 
introduction of a new restructured defined contributory pension system for new entrants to Central Government 
services, except to Armed Forces. An independent Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority have 
also been set up to regulate and develop the pension market. 
It  is  important  to  note  that  pension  schemes  for  Government  employees  in  India  are  non-contributory  and 
unfunded. As such, these are to be met through Government’s current revenues. Traditional fiscal indicators 
based on cash flow accounting do not capture the implications of pension liabilities. Hence, size of the debt 
based  cash  flow  deficit  does  not  fully  reflect  Government’s  liabilities.  Any  realistic  assessment  of  the  fiscal 
situation would also need to address the issue of pension liabilities. 
In the context of the new contributory pension scheme for Central Government employees, an important issue 
is funding of existing pension liabilities and pension fund management. The pension reforms announced for the 
Central Government employees will yield positive returns only in the long run. During the transitional period, the 
burden  on  the  Government  finances  will  in  fact  increase  as  the  Government  will  have  to  contribute  to  the 
pension fund as also meet the pension liabilities of the existing employees and pensioners. This calls for some 
funding  arrangement  for  existing  employees  as  well.  Appropriate  regulatory  framework  for  pension  fund 
management is another important aspect crucial for enhancing the credibility of the funded pension schemes.

Pension liabilities of the State Governments in India 
Box 3 
At the State Government level, the issue of increasing pension liabilities has also assumed critical importance 
since their unfunded and non-contributory nature has proved to be a mounting burden on the State budgets. 
So  far,  however,  only  a  few  State  Governments  have  initiated  measures  towards  the  introduction  of  a 
contributory pension scheme. A Group to Study the Pension Liabilities of the State Governments submitted its 
report in February 2003, which was published in February 2004. 
Some of the major recommendations of the Group are: Introduction of contributory pension scheme/s which 
should be mandatory for all new employees of the State Governments in place of the existing non-contributory 
defined benefit pension scheme. The recommended alternative pension models are: 
(i) 
Pure Defined Contribution (DC) Scheme in which the new employees and the Government each would 
contribute  10  per  cent  of  the  basic  pay  and  dearness  allowance  to  an  individual  account.  The 
contributions will be vested in a Fund, which will be invested in accordance with specified guidelines. 
The  employee  at  the  time  of  retirement  will  get  an  amount  which  will  be  the  aggregate  total  of  the 
employee’s contribution, Government’s (employer’s) contribution and the earnings (on investment made 
by the Fund) attributed to the employee’s Account; 
A Defined Contribution - Defined Benefit (DC-DB) Scheme - a contributory scheme with guarantee of an 
appropriate level of pension fixed by individual State Governments; and 
A Two-Tier Scheme (i.e. a DC-DB Scheme plus a second tier of DC Scheme) - the defined benefit in 
the first Tier of DC-DB scheme could be reduced from the present level of 50 per cent to an appropriate 
level of say 30 per cent and supplemented by a mandatory DC scheme, wherein both the employees 
and the State Governments make contributions. 
(ii) 
(iii) 
To have some immediate and medium-term effect on State finances, a few parametric changes in the current 
pension scheme for both the existing employees and pensioners become inevitable. These include immediate 
withdrawal  of  fixing  of  pensions  on  the  basis  of  only  last  one  month’s  pay,  wherever  applicable,  eliminating 
wage  indexation,  wherever  applicable;  and  maximum  permissible  commutation  amount  to  be  brought  down 
from 40 per cent of Basic Pension to 33 1/3 per cent (1/3rd). 
In order to at least partially meet the pension burden of the existing employees and pensioners, there is a need 
for  setting  up  a  “Dedicated  Pension  Fund”  through  levying  a  cess  on/collecting  contributions  from  all  the 
existing  employees,  retaining  a  portion  of  increased  salary  and  dearness  allowance  (DA)  arising  from  the 
revisions in salary and DA, and taking steps to augment the Fund. 
 
China 
Old-age security is one of the first components of the social security system in China to be selected for 
reform. Originally, China’s social security system was designed to deliver many of the social services 
and benefits to the population through state-owned enterprises. In the process of reform of the social 
security  system,  government  has  made  clear  the  need  to  shift  responsibility  for  providing  social 
services and benefits from enterprises to a combination of the government, enterprises, community, 
and individuals. 
The  weaknesses  and  limitations  of  the  old-age  pension  system  established  in  the  1950s  became 
apparent  as  China  shifted  towards  a  market-oriented  economy  in  the  early  1980s.  The  enterprise-
based  system  was  increasingly  unable  to  meet  present  obligations,  and  pay-as-you-go  financing 
clearly  would  be  unsuitable  to  meet  the  challenge  of  the  next  century  with  an  ageing  population. 
Various reforms of the pension system were underway on a trial basis in a number of cities by the 
mid-1980s.  Pension  reform  gained  momentum  in  the  early  1990s  when  experiments  became  more 
widespread, and social security reform began to focus on expanded coverage and uniformity in design 
details. 
China has taken rapid strides in laying the foundation for a more stable old age security system. The 
new system includes multiple pillars, although attention thus far has focused on the social or public 
pillar. The financing burden is being shared by employees, employers, and the government rather than 
being borne exclusively by the individual work unit. The framework is in place for a defined contribution 
plan, which can become funded, and a defined benefit plan, which may remain pay-as-you-go. Also, 
pensions are being indexed to control the erosion of pension value by inflation. 
Pension reform is incomplete, however, and a number of important issues remain to be tackled. It is 
critical that regulations and supervision catch up with the new system. Contributors and beneficiaries 
BIS Review 55/2004

alike  need  to  be  assured  that  funds  are  properly  managed.  In  addition,  if  pension  reform  is  to  be 
successful, it is imperative that state-owned enterprise reform proceeds. There are many aspects to 
state-owned  enterprise  reform,  including  the  establishment  of  unemployment  insurance,  housing 
reform,  and  a  determination  of  how  to  value  and  sell  off  state  assets  while  preserving  a  portion  of 
assets  from  bankrupt  enterprises  to  cover  pension  obligations.  Delay  in  completing  state-owned 
enterprise reform runs the risk of the reformed pension system unraveling if the current need to bail 
out state-owned enterprises and excuse their pension contributions continues indefinitely. 
Growing  pension  liabilities,  globally,  have  resulted  in  significant  reforms  in  pension  schemes. 
Measures include the introduction of higher retirement ages; increased employee contribution rates; 
lowering  benefit  accrual  rates;  and  changing  the  post  retirement  indexation  policy.  A  number  of 
countries have also realised the need to achieve some level of advance funding of benefit obligations. 
In Asia, pension reforms can be characterised as diverse, ranging from the advanced modern systems 
as prevalent in Singapore, Korea and Malaysia to the relatively less advanced systems in most other 
countries.  In  this  regard,  medical  and  health  insurance  are  quite  comprehensive  in  the  East  Asian 
countries. China and India has only recently embarked on the path of pension reforms although the 
coverage is still confined to the organised sector. Medical Insurance continues to be based on private 
funding in India. Pension schemes has got to be from both the public and private sector and, in this 
context, the development of robust debt markets, in particular, and financial markets, in general, is a 
necessary prerequisite which would facilitate the mobilisation and channelling of savings in high return 
yielding  assets.  This,  in  turn,  would  make  pension  funds  viable  and  capable  of  withstanding  the 
economic pressures of population ageing. 
 Approach to Asian ageing 
VI. 
As  in  other  parts  of  the  world,  Asia  is  also  undergoing  rapid  ageing  of  its  population  as  a  result  of 
much  increased  longevity  in  the  lives  of  most  people.  The  emerging  process  will  be  similar  to  that 
being  observed  in  developed  countries  already,  but  the  onset  of  fiscal  pressures  will  perhaps  be 
delayed by 25 to 50 years in different Asian countries. The existence of a large proportion of rural farm 
based  populations,  lower  life  expectancy  and  the  tradition  of  family  support  systems  has  so  far 
masked the problems of ageing in Asian countries. With increasing urbanization, life expectancy, and 
breakdown of family support systems, the pressures for public funding for health care and support of 
the aged are bound to increase in Asia in the years to come. 
Among the key differences with the developed world are 
• 
Ageing  is  taking  place  at  much  lower  income  levels  and  hence  capacity  to  fund  social 
welfare is lower. 
There continue to be huge demands for funding of both physical and social infrastructure in 
growing Asian economies. 
Some countries have constrained fiscal situations. 
• 
Our key advantage in Asia is that we know the future: we can see it in the emerging demographic 
challenges of the developed countries. What then are the lessons for us: 
• 
• 
Do active fiscal consolidation before these new fiscal challenges emerge. 
Pay serious attention to policy design for both health care and pension/social security 
systems.  As  for  as  possible,  reduce  the  weight  of  defined  benefit  pension  systems  and 
move  towards  fully  funded  systems,  or  a  judicious  fiscally  responsible  combination  of  the 
two. In the case of health, with vaulting technology, it is essential to keep a strict watch on 
health  costs,  and  to  design  sustainable  health  insurance  systems  with  an  eye  to  future 
ageing related liabilities. 
Pay attention to policy implications of ageing: A key component of this is to slow down 
the  shift  from  private  to  public  provision  of  both  social  security  and  health  care.  Serious 
thought can be given to appropriate incentive mechanisms that encourage family provision 
caring of the aged. Social security systems in Asia are at a formative stage and care can be 
taken to not go the way of developed countries in terms of universal public coverage. 
Provide  for  flexibility:  Although  the  demographic  future  is  relatively  clear,  unexpected 
economic and other changes do take place. Thus, there is great need for building in flexibility 
  26 
 BIS Review 55/2004
in policy design in terms of social security expenditure. As the total dependency ratio is not 
projected to increase, the gradual transformation to an ageing population would imply a shift 
in  social  security  expenditure  pattern  from  education  to  health  care  and  pensions.  While 
expenditure on medical and health care would be a mix of public and private expenditure, 
that on education may have a greater component of private provision. Thus, policy design 
will need to look ahead at the pattern of demographic change in a detailed manner to provide 
for flexibility in the public/private components of potential social expenditures. 
Focus  on  those  who  cannot  help  themselves:  In  view  of  the  relatively  lower  levels  of 
incomes in Asian countries and fiscal constraints, more care can be taken on focusing public 
social  expenditures  on  the  relatively  less  well  off,  and  avoid  the  perils  of  universal 
applicability of social security. This would clearly imply a measure of income redistribution: 
how much is feasible without significant impact on savings and work behaviour? 
 There are a number of positive features in the current Asian economic scenario that can mitigate the 
expected fiscal challenges of ageing. Let me turn to some of them. 
Role of migration and remittances 
Remittances play a critical social insurance role - and this has significant impact on both poverty and 
equity (Kapur, 2003). Remittances for some Asian countries, especially for South-Asia, are very high 
constituting about 63 per cent of total net inflows. Remittances finance consumption, land and housing 
purchases  and  philanthropy  and  they  are  an  important  soruce  of  social  insurance  in  lower  income 
countries. The effects of remittances are complex and are a function of the characteristics of migrants 
and  the  households  they  leave  behind,  their  motivations,  and  the  overall  economic  environment.  In 
Asian countries, particularly in the Indian sub-continent, remittances are a steady source of resources 
at  low-income  levels,  which  are  invariant  to  market  conditions.  As  such,  these  flows  seem  to  be 
unaffected by changes in interest rates, country ratings, etc. 
Projections show that the median age of developed countries would be about 46 years around 2050. 
This is indicative of an ageing population which is clearly unsustainable from the point of working age 
population.  One  solution  for  lowering  the  fiscal  burden  would  be  either  by  encouraging  large-scale 
migration  or  increases  in  existing  birth  rates.  Historical  evidence,  however,  does  not  support  the 
possibility  of  higher  fertility  once  fertility  dips  below replacement  level.  Migration  would  facilitate  the 
problem  of  ageing  in  both  the  developed  countries  and  the  poorer  ones.  In  developed  countries,  it 
would add to the younger workforce thereby increasing productivity, generate higher tax revenues and 
social security contributions. On the other hand, continuous flow of remittances from migrant workers 
would add to the private provisions supporting the old thereby reducing the fiscal burden of both the 
countries.  It  may  be  noted  that  India  and  the  Philippines  have  recorded  relatively  high  remittances 
during the last decade, which are now in excess of 3 per cent of GDP of these countries. 
Thus  migration  has  to  be  part  of  the  ageing  story.  It  is  good  for  recipient  countries,  reducing 
dependency ratios, increases tax resources and increasing growth. 
It is good for sending countries, reducing the pressure for job generation; a good source of funding for 
family retention of the old; and good for on the job training. 
Economic growth 
Unlike developed countries, where economic growth is now constrained by the limits to productivity 
growth, Asian countries will continue to exhibit high rates of growth for some time to come. First, as 
incomes  grow,  India,  Indonesia,  and  others  will  continue  to  exhibit  high  savings  rates.  Second,  as 
latecomers, technology adoption is cheap; productivity improvement and consequent economic growth 
can occur at a fast pace. But third, to get these benefits, employment generation is essential and a key 
problem for policy design. However, it is continued high economic growth and savings rates that can 
do much to enable Asian countries to provide for the fiscal challenges that will emerge from ageing. 
Financial markets 
If we are to avoid the trap of public provision of welfare except for the needy, the development of a 
healthy  privately  funded  system  will  depend  crucially  on  the  adequate  development  of  financial 
BIS Review 55/2004 
 27
markets.  As  financial  savings  increase  and  health,  insurance  and  pension  funds  are  to  provide 
adequate returns, they need to be invested in productive activities providing adequate returns. 
The first need is the maintenance of prudent macroeconomic management, accompanied by monetary 
stability, with low and stable inflation. Second, confidence in equity markets needs to be developed. 
Hence there is a need for continued improvements in regulation. Third, bond market development is in 
its infancy in Asia. This needs to be nurtured and developed consciously to provide adequate depth 
and breadth for fixed income instruments necessary for investment of social security funds. 
Infrastructure 
We  have  great  opportunities  in  this  direction  for  the  efficient  intermediation  of  funds  for  productive 
uses.  The  21st  century  is  Asia’s  urban  century.  Large  resources  will  continue  to  be  needed  for 
different  segments  of  infrastructure:  urban  infrastructure,  particularly  water,  sanitation,  sewerage; 
power; ports, airports, railways, roads and the like. The telecom sector has provided an example of 
private  funding  of  infrastructure  where  appropriate  financial  return  can  lead  to  large  and  rapid 
investment. The levy and collection of appropriate user charges is essential and a certain degree of 
financial  engineering,  including  public  partnership,  is  required  for  providing  adequate  and  relatively 
large returns. 
The current availability of high savings in Asian countries can therefore be married to the development 
of adequate financial and capital markets to avoid the potential fiscal challenges of ageing in Asia. 
Low and sustainable inflation is key to macroeconomic stability. Monetary authorities, by emphasizing 
price stability can anchor inflation expectations, thereby facilitating the emergence of a smooth term 
structure of interest rates. This would not only strengthen monetary and fiscal coordination but also 
develop  the debt  market.  Thus,  the  enduring  message  for  the  Asian  countries  is  that  they ought  to 
adopt  an  integrated  policy  framework  on  population  ageing  covering  demographic  transition  and 
reforms in the fiscal and financial sectors. 
In conclusion, 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Asian countries have the advantage of seeing what is happening in the West. 
We can avoid the follies of excessive social welfare states. 
We need to develop funded health and pension schemes. 
We  need  to  consciously  delay  the  shift  from  private  welfare  provision  to  public  welfare 
provision. 
The indications are that we will probably succeed.
