Irma Rosenberg: Monetary policy and the conditions for growth 
Speech  by  Ms  Irma  Rosenberg,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  an  economics 
conference, Klippan (in the south of Sweden), 1 November 2004. 
 Let me begin by thanking you for the invitation to come here and speak. 
The subject for this year’s conference is growth. This is a subject close to the hearts of economists 
and one that often crops up in debate. What factors determine economic growth in the long term, and 
what can be done to increase it? I intend to approach this question from a central bank perspective. Is 
it possible, for instance, for the Riksbank to use monetary policy to raise the level of long-term growth? 
Are there means of affecting growth? Long-term, or potential, growth is a many-faceted concept and I 
intend to begin by speaking about the prevailing theory with regard to links to monetary policy. I shall 
then go into more detail on the underlying determining factors behind the long-term growth rate and 
briefly  describe  trends  in  recent  years.  I  shall  also  speculate  on  possible  future  developments  and 
what can be done to improve long-term growth prospects. 
Long-term growth and monetary policy 
Let us start with Figure 1, where the blue line shows developments in real GDP in Sweden during the 
period 1950 to 2003. One can see that there has been a clear trend increase during these years. In 
1950, the total output value was just over SEK 500 billion, measured at current prices, and in 2003 it 
was  around  SEK  2,300  billion.  However,  one  can  also  see  that  this  has  not  been  an  even 
development. GDP growth has been more rapid during certain periods than others and during some 
episodes, such as the 1990s crisis, the level of output even fell. But seen over a longer period, the 
increase  in  GDP  has  been  relatively  stable.  On  average,  output  rose  by  2.7  per  cent  during  these 
years. 
The orange line in the figure shows how a measure of trend, or potential, output has developed over 
the same period. Potential output in principle reflects the capacity limits put on production of goods 
and  services  at  a  given  point  in  time.  One  type  of  limit  is  the  access  to  resources  for  production  - 
factors  of  production  -  in  the  economy.  This  normally  covers  two  main  factors:  labour  force  and 
physical  capital,  i.e.  factories,  machinery,  etc.  Another  limitation  is  how  productive  these  factors  of 
production are, that is to say, how much that can be produced in, for example, one hour of work or use 
of the machinery. 
It is important to emphasise that potential output is not an estimate of a ceiling for production. It is 
therefore not a measure of the level of output that would apply if the entire labour force were employed 
and all physical capital was used to the maximum. By potential output and potential growth we mean 
instead the output and growth that is possible without serious imbalances arising in the economy; the 
level of output at which supply and demand correspond and actual and expected inflation are in line 
with the central bank’s inflation target (assuming that there is one). The potential output level is not 
constant  over  time;  it  usually  shows  a  growth  trend,  which  is  illustrated  in  Figure  1.  This  is  mainly 
because technological developments mean that higher output can be achieved with the same amount 
of factors of production. Another reason could be long-term changes in the factors of production. The 
change in potential output from year to year is equal to the potential growth of the economy, which 
thus is the growth rate that is sustainable in the long term. Figure 1 shows the potential output level 
according to a simple statistical method where the trend, and thereby also the potential growth rate, is 
allowed to vary over time. 
The difference between actual and potential output is known as the output gap, and this reflects the 
cyclical variations in the economy. A negative output gap, that is to say, when actual output is lower 
than potential output, is usually connected with a recession. The demand pressure for goods, services 
and the factors of production is then small and there are ample unutilised resources in the economy. 
Price and wage increases are small and inflation is usually below the central bank’s target level. When 
there  is  a  positive  output  gap,  the  circumstances  are  normally  the  reverse.  Then,  actual  output  is 
higher than potential output, resources are strained, unemployment is lower than normal and inflation 
is higher than the target level. When the economy is in balance, the output gap is closed, that is to 
say, equal to zero.

In practice, both actual and potential output is affected by various shocks which mean that the output 
gap is rarely zero. If there is a situation with a negative output to begin with, the economy can grow 
more rapidly than its potential output rate for a short period. The fact is that this is necessary in such a 
situation in order to close the gap and bring the economy back into balance. However, problems arise 
if the economy grows at a more rapid rate than that allowed by potential growth over a longer period of 
time. Then production resources become strained, bottlenecks arise and tendencies appear towards 
overheating. In this way, potential growth for the economy can be likened to a recommended speed 
from which it is important not to deviate for too long a period. 
It is in this short-term perspective that monetary policy can play a role in influencing growth. As the 
output  gap  reflects  the  demand  pressure  in  the  economy  and  the  demand  pressure  in  turn  affects 
inflation, monetary policy is largely about choosing an interest rate that will make the output gap as 
small as possible. If actual and potential output coincide so that the output gap is closed, inflation is in 
line with the Riksbank’s target of 2 per cent, assuming that there is confidence in the policy conducted. 
This  means  at  the  same  time  that  the  size  of  potential  growth  affects  the  scope  for  conducting 
monetary policy. The higher the long-term sustainable growth rate, the higher the actual growth rate 
can be without resource utilisation becoming so high that inflation takes off and the Riksbank is forced 
to intervene to subdue demand. 
This reasoning is of necessity somewhat simplified. In actual fact, temporary shocks to inflation can 
occur that lead to inflation not being on target, despite the fact that actual and potential output are at 
the same level. However, in this case, inflation is in practice probably close to the target, so a more 
realistic  description  is  therefore  that  the  target  on  average  is  met  when  the  output  gap  is  closed. 
Moreover,  monetary  policy  affects  demand  with  some  lag.  Consequently,  the  Riksbank  adjusts  the 
interest  rate  in  accordance  with  forecasts  of  inflation  a  couple  of  years  ahead.  During  this  period 
shocks can of course occur in the economy that couldn’t be foreseen at the time of the forecast. We 
therefore attempt to avoid excessive fluctuations in the economy by gradually bringing inflation back 
towards the target. 
Thus, in the short term, the Riksbank can affect output and employment by adjusting the interest rate, 
thereby stimulating or cooling down economic activity. But in the long run, attempts, for example, to 
make the economy grow faster than its long-term sustainable rate would only result in higher inflation 
without  any  change  in  output  or  employment.  As  I  mentioned,  the  economy’s  long-term  capacity  is 
limited by the size of the factors of production and their productivity. These factors cannot be governed 
by monetary policy. By changing the interest rate, the Riksbank can affect actual output growth in the 
short term but not the potential, long-term growth rate. Monetary policy can possibly indirectly lay the 
foundation for good growth in the long term by ensuring that our payment and price-setting system 
functions in an efficient and confidence-inspiring manner. 
What determines long-term growth? 
As  you  understand  from  what  I  have  said  this  far,  it  is  important  for  the  Riksbank  to  make  a  good 
assessment  of  the  Swedish  economy’s  potential  growth  capacity  in  order  to  conduct  successful 
monetary  policy.  We  therefore  return  to  this  issue  fairly  often  in,  for  instance,  our  Inflation Reports. 
One difficulty is that potential output and potential growth cannot be observed directly in the same way 
as actual GDP and employment. Instead, the measure must be estimated using statistical methods 
and there are a number of these, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In other words, 
there are several different ways of drawing the orange line in Figure 1, and the different methods have 
demonstrated  fairly  differing  results.  The  Riksbank  therefore  uses  several  different  methods  of 
calculating  the  output  gap.  We  also  supplement  our  analysis  with  a  number  of  other  indicators  of 
resource utilisation in the economy. 
As  I  mentioned  earlier,  long-term  sustainable  growth  in  the  economy  is  determined  partly  by 
technological  developments  in  society.  This  means  that  production  per  hour  worked  shows  an 
increasing trend over time and thus is one of the more important contributions to long-term growth. But 
long-term  changes  in  the  factors  of  production  can  also  affect  potential  growth.  If  we  measure  the 
labour force’s contribution to production in the number of hours worked, one can express it simply as 
our  long-term  growth  potential  depending  on  how  much  we  work  and  how  productive  we  are. 
However, it is important to point out that it is the more long-term developments in productivity growth 
and the change in labour contributions that are significant in this context.

I mentioned earlier that different methods of estimating potential growth can give quite different results. 
One  of  the  reasons  is  that  it  is  difficult  to  distinguish  the  more  long-term  sustainable  trend  from 
temporary developments. It is of course no easy task to determine whether a change is permanent 
when we receive new statistics on economic developments. However, it appears that this can even be 
difficult to determine afterwards, when studying the historical trend. As I intend to illustrate, this applies 
to both productivity and labour supply. So, allow me to proceed to look more closely at the determining 
factors behind long-term growth and see how they have developed historically and what can be said 
about future developments. I shall begin with labour productivity. 
Productivity growth 
Figure 2 shows the annual change in labour productivity, measured as GDP per hour worked, together 
with  an  estimate  of  the  long-term  trend.  At  the  bottom  of  the  figure  is  the  average  rate  of  change 
during  different  periods  of  time.  We  can  see  that  productivity  growth  is  nearly  always  positive  and 
varies  considerably  from  year  to  year,  but  also  that  it  has  had  a  tendency  to  increase  over  time, 
particularly  during  the  1990s.  This  is  a  clear  difference  compared  with  the  previous  decade.  On 
average, the increase in productivity was 1.2 per cent during the 1980s. During the 1990s, there was a 
rapid increase and productivity growth reached an average level of above 2 per cent. This average 
subsequently remained at that level for the remainder of the period. 
What is the reason for this more favourable development? We do not have any certain answers, but 
there are still some factors that have most probably contributed to this development. To begin with, we 
must remember that the Swedish economy underwent a severe crisis at the beginning of the 1990s 
and this probably contributed to raising productivity growth during the first half of the decade. Many 
companies went out of business during the crisis; companies with relatively low profitability. Although 
this  led  to  an  increase  in  the  productivity  growth  measured  during  a  transitional  period,  this  was  at 
substantial  cost  to  those  who  lost  their  jobs  and  the  economy  as  a  whole,  as  a  large  part  of  the 
economy’s available resources were not utilised. 
During and directly after the crisis there were also a number of structural changes in the economy that 
are likely to have affected developments. Fiscal policy was tightened, with an expenditure ceiling and 
surplus  target,  while  monetary  policy  was  targeted  at  achieving  a  low,  stable  inflation  rate.  Such  a 
stabilisation of the macroeconomy means that uncertainty about issues such as future tax rates and 
price  developments  decrease,  which  in  turn  makes  it  easier  for  households  and  firms  to  plan. 
Comparative studies of different countries have shown that this can have longer-term effects, partly 
through  a  rise  in  productivity.  Furthermore,  several  markets  were  opened  to  both  domestic  and 
international  competition  through  deregulation.  Greater  competition  increases  the  pressure  on 
profitability,  which  raises  motivation  for  making  production  and  organisations  more  efficient,  for 
instance with the aid of more modern technology. 
There were also other types of structural changes in the Swedish economy during the 1990s. Up to 
the  beginning  of  the  1990s,  the  number  of  people  employed  in  the  public  sector  increased,  with  a 
corresponding decline in the private sector. After the crisis there was a turnaround, and the private 
sector’s  share  began  to  increase  again.  A  shift  from  the  public  sector  to  the  private  sector  most 
probably entails an increase in productivity throughout the economy. One complication in this context 
is that, for technical reasons, it is difficult to measure productivity growth in the public sector in the 
National Accounts. The studies that have been carried out indicate that it is lower in the public sector 
than in the private sector.1 So far, the statistics are quite simply based on the assumption that there is 
no productivity increase in the public sector at all. 
Another  important  change  in  the  significance  of  different  sectors  in  the  economy  was  the  rapid 
expansion  in  the  information  and  communications  technology  sector,  particularly  during  the  second 
half of the 1990s. There has been lively discussion of the actual significance of information technology 
for productivity growth in this period. What we can see, is that a large part of the productivity growth 
during  the  latter  part  of  the  1990s  originated  from  the  sectors  producing  information  and  telecom 
products. Compared with this IT-producing sector, developments in the IT-using sectors was not at all 
as impressive, despite large investments in IT during the period.

What  does  all  this  mean  for  future  long-term  productivity  growth?  The  very  high  growth  figures  for 
productivity  during  the  latter  part  of  the  1990s  reflected  both  the  macroeconomic  stabilisation,  an 
expansion in the private sector relative to the public sector, and in particular the IT expansion. It is 
unlikely  that  the  development  will  continue  in  the  same  way  in  the  future.  However,  we  know  that 
productivity growth has been surprisingly high in recent years. Many economists are busy working on 
the question of which factors lie behind this development. It is clear that, unlike the 1990s, it is not a 
question of high productivity growth in the IT sector and major investment in IT. One theory that has 
been put forward is that it may perhaps be explained by delayed effects in other sectors of earlier IT 
investment; that it has quite simply taken time for companies to adjust and to take advantage of the 
new technology. 
It is thus difficult to say anything about the durability of the most recent development. However, there 
are many indications that the long-term increase in productivity now is higher than it was during the 
1980s. The widespread structural changes that took place during the 1990s are also an indication of 
this. Nor should it be forgotten, that the labour force is better educated today than it was ten years 
ago, particularly with regard to the percentage of those with a university education. There are studies 
indicating that the improvement in qualifications has also contributed to the growth in productivity. 
The  possibility  to  improve  productivity  using  economic  policy,  in  addition  to  the  basic  contribution 
made by price stability and healthy government finances, is probably fairly small, as it is difficult, for 
instance, to govern how and when technological breakthroughs will occur. On the other hand, one can 
try  to  affect  the  conditions  for  good  productivity  growth,  for  instance  by  ensuring  that  competitive 
pressure is maintained in the economy and by conducting a good research and education policy. 
Labour supply growth 
Let  us  now  leave  productivity  growth  and  move  on  to  the  other  important  component,  the  labour 
supply.  Figure  3  shows  the  annual  growth  in  the number  of  hours  worked  throughout  the economy 
from 1981 onwards. As before, I have included an estimate of the long-term development. As can be 
seen, it is only weakly positive for the period as a whole. During the 1980s, the labour market was 
strong and we can see that the number of hours worked essentially grew during the whole period, up 
to the crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. The fact that the crisis had a dramatic effect on the labour 
input in the economy is also clear. On average, developments then improved during the second half of 
the  1990s,  but  the  positive  trend  has  been  broken  in  recent  years.  What  lies  behind  this  and  what 
conclusions can be drawn with regard to the future development of the labour supply? 
One way of examining what has driven developments is to divide up the number of hours worked into 
different sub-components. The number of hours worked in the economy is determined partly by how 
many people actually work and partly by how many hours each person works. The number of people 
in work is determined first and foremost by how large a percentage of the population are of working 
age, defined here as 20-64 years of age. For various reasons, not all of these people are available for 
work,  so  the  labour  supply  is  also  affected  by  the  percentage  of  people  of  working  age  that  are 
included in the labour force. Of the people in the labour force, some are unemployed and some are 
employed.  Finally,  owing  to  various  types  of  absence  from  work,  only  a  certain  percentage  of  the 
employed  actually  contribute  hours  worked  in  production.  If  one  totals  the  changes  in  all  of  these 
components  and  also  takes  into  account  how  much  each  works  in  a  given  year,  one  obtains  the 
change in the number of hours worked that year. 
By  studying  the  relative  development  of  the  components  over  time,  it  is  possible  to  see  how  the 
significance  of  different  factors  has  varied,  and  also  to  speculate  about  the  long-term  trend  in  the 
future labour supply. In this context there are many interesting relationships to observe. Let me point 
out some aspects that illustrate some of the problems the Swedish economy is currently facing and 
will be struggling with in future. 
Figure 4 shows the population growth and the change in the number of people of working age. The 
part of the curves shown as a broken line represents Statistics Sweden’s forecasts. As you can see, 
developments have varied quite a lot during this period, and unlike what many people may believe, the 
demographical  development  during  the  1990s  was  relatively  favourable  from  the  perspective  of  the 
labour  force.  The  growth  in  the  working  age  population  has  been  higher  than  the  total  population 
growth, so the percentage of people of working age has increased during the period. As can be seen, 
this  development  will  deteriorate  dramatically  towards  the  end  of  this  decade.  It  is  quite  simply  an 
illustration of the problem of having an ageing population, which means that the dependency burden 
for those of working age will increase dramatically.

 BIS Review 64/2004
Another  important  observation  refers  to  the  percentage  of  the  population  of  working  age  who  are 
included  in  the  labour  force  and  the  percentage  of  people  in  the  labour  force  who  are  employed. 
Figure 5 shows that both the percentage of the labour force and the percentage of those employed 
vary according to the economic cycle. When economic activity slows down, and it is difficult to get a 
job,  there  is  a  decline  not  only  in  employment  but  also  in  the  number  of  people  who  say  they  are 
actively seeking work. 
On the other hand, economic activity cannot explain why the level of both the percentage of the labour 
force  and  the  degree  of  employment  appear  to  have  fallen  after  the  1990s  crisis.  The  degree  of 
employment fell considerably in connection with the crisis years and has only partially recovered since 
then.  Moreover,  since  the  1990s  crisis,  many  of  those  who  lost  their  jobs  have  not  returned  to  the 
labour market at all. This is ominous, given that economic growth in the past decade has nevertheless 
been relatively high in a historical perspective. To some extent, the drop in the labour force percentage 
can  be  explained  by  education  factors.  In  connection  with  the  1990s  crisis  there  was  a  significant 
decline  in  labour  force  participation  among  younger  age  groups,  which  was  connected  to  tougher 
competition  for  jobs  and  many  young  people  choosing  to  improve  their  qualifications  instead  of 
entering  the  labour  market.  Since  then,  there  have  been  changes  aimed  at  raising  the  level  of 
education in society in general, for instance by lengthening upper-secondary school programmes and 
expanding university colleges. These education initiatives are highly justifiable in themselves, but they 
also entail a lower participation in the labour force and thereby an increased dependency burden for 
the active part of the population. 
Although some of the decline in labour force participation can be attributed to education factors, this is 
not the full explanation. Calculations for 2003 show that close to 30 per cent of the group remaining 
outside  the  labour  force  were  studying.  The  others  remained  outside  the  labour  force  for  other 
reasons, with early retirement for health reasons, now known as sickness benefit, as one of the most 
common causes. The number of newly-granted early retirements rose sharply from 1997 onwards. In 
recent years, this increase has been particularly large with regard to people under the age of 50.2 The 
percentage of those participating in the labour force has fallen from around 88 per cent at its highest 
point in 1990 to about 82 per cent today. The fact that such a high percentage of people of working 
age are outside the labour force will limit growth in the future and will contribute to further exacerbating 
the problem of an ageing population. 
Figure  6  shows  both  the  percentage  of  employed  actually  working  and  the  mean  working  time  for 
people in work.3 As you can see from the Figure, developments in these factors also vary according to 
the  economic  cycle.  During  the  boom  at  the  end  of  the  1980s,  the  number  of  hours  per  person 
rocketed while the percentage of people in work declined, partly due to a growth in sick leave. Many 
studies have indicated that there is a link between total absence due to sickness and the situation in 
the  labour  market.  When  the  situation  in  the  labour  market  improves,  absence  due  to  sickness 
increases, and vice versa. However, this relationship does not seem to apply to long-term sick leave, 
which is the type of sick leave that has increased most in recent years. How to resolve this is another 
subject much debated at present. 
In recent years, both the percentage of people at work and the hours worked per person have fallen 
and thus provided a negative contribution to the change in the total number of hours worked in the 
economy. The fact that mean working time has fallen is partly due to a decline in overtime and normal 
working hours. The reason behind this development is not entirely clear. Cyclical effects as well as the 
effects of taxes and benefits are possible explanations. Seen in a longer-term perspective ahead, it is 
likely that households will tend to want to reduce the mean working time per person so as to use some 
of their increased prosperity in the form of more leisure time. 
So what conclusions can we draw regarding developments in the total number of hours worked in the 
economy on the basis of this review of the various components? Unfortunately, the prospects are not 
so  bright  if  no  measures  are  taken  to  improve  the  situation.  In  a  long-term  perspective,  the 
demographic development is very unfavourable because the percentage of the population of working 
age is decreasing. The problems will be exacerbated if the rise in early retirement and long-term sick

leave together cannot be broken. Labour force participation and the degree of employment seem to 
have  attained  a  lower  level  following  the  1990s  crisis.  Unemployment  also  varies  considerably 
between  occupational  categories  and  different  parts  of  the  country.  This  indicates  that  there  are 
structural problems and that the functioning of the labour market and the social insurance system must 
be improved. 
The conclusion  that  can be  drawn  is that  the  weak  growth  in  employment  is  not  mainly  due  to  low 
demand in the economy - although economic activity has not been favourable recently. There is thus 
no point in seeking the answer to these problems in stabilisation policy. It is structural policy measures 
that are needed to improve the functioning of the labour market. There are a number of projects there 
that could contribute to raising the labour supply, at least in the medium term. As I understand it, these 
include both general measures to increase the labour supply among all groups in the economy and 
specific  measures  to  increase  the  supply  among  certain  groups  where  there  may  be  a  greater 
potential for increases. 
What can be done to increase the labour supply? 
Economic incentives can affect individuals’ participation in the work force, but economic theory alone 
cannot  always  determine  which  effects  they  will  have.  Take  the  example  of  reduced  marginal  tax. 
While reducing this tax will increase real wages, it does not automatically mean that people want to 
work more. This is because the wage increase has two effects. Firstly, it makes work more profitable 
relative to leisure and thus contributes to wanting to exchange leisure for work. On the other hand, an 
increased real wage means that one receives a larger income for the same amount of work and this 
means one can afford more leisure. There are thus two counteracting effects. Purely theoretically, it is 
impossible to say what the net effect will be; empirical research must attempt to answer this question. 
Many empirical studies have been made in this field, for instance, at the time of the large tax reform in 
the  beginning  of  the  1990s.  The result  of  the  studies  is  not  unequivocal,  but a  common  conclusion 
appears to be that the labour supply calculated in hours increased after the tax reform, although the 
size  of  the  effect  is  much  debated.  Comparing  different  groups,  the  effect  seems  to  have  been 
relatively larger among women and relatively smaller among those with a low income and/or that work 
part-time.  One  complication  with  this  kind  of  study  is  that  the  labour  provided  by  many  people  is 
probably determined at household level rather than individual level. The labour force participation for 
an individual may also be affected by changes in their husband’s/wife’s/partner’s income. 
Recently, the focus has moved partly away from pure studies of the effects of the income tax system 
to  the  combined  effects  on  the  labour  supply  of  taxes  and  various  benefit  and  social  insurance 
systems. The focus has often been on people that work to a smaller extent, that are on sick leave or 
that  are  outside  the  labour  force.  We  know  from  economic  research  that  different  types  of 
compensation and benefit affect the individual’s reservation wage, that is to say, the wage level that 
primarily influences the individual’s decision to participate in the work force. 
The  reservation  wage  varies  from  person  to  person  and  if  the  wage  level  offered  on  the  market  is 
lower  than  the  reservation  wage,  the  person  chooses  not  to  work.  One  can  say  that  the  individual 
values his or her time more highly than the market does. The relationship between the wages for work 
offered on the market and the individual reservation wage is thus a decisive factor in the decision on 
whether or not to work. It is easy to understand that the reservation wage will be affected by taxes, 
compensation  levels  in  the  unemployment  and  social  insurance  systems,  rules  for  early  retirement, 
etc. Surveys of individuals’ choices with regard to labour supply, which take into account both taxes 
and various types of benefit, indicate that the forming of the benefit system may have a greater effect 
on labour supply than changes in the taxation system.4 
Is  it  possible  to  say  anything  about  the  size  of  the  present  driving  forces  for  increasing  the  labour 
supply? The most recent report of the Long-term Planning Commission and the National Institute of

leave and work, as well as the driving forces that make people work slightly longer hours. Economic 
driving forces refers in principle to the effect on disposable income entailed in the change in labour 
supply, if one takes into account the effect of different types of tax, benefit and charge, in addition to 
direct wage effects. The starting point is that the driving forces are lower the smaller the difference in 
income is from changing status, or alternatively the less income one can keep after the increase in the 
labour supply. 
The  Long-term  Planning Commission has  made calculations  that  indicate  that  the  economic  driving 
forces  for  returning  to  work  are  generally  low with regard  to unemployment and  usually  even  lower 
with  regard  to  sick  leave.  These  calculations  show  that  almost  four  out  of  ten  wage-earners  retain 
90 per cent or more of their income when they go on sick leave. Approximately one out of ten retains 
less than 70 per cent. The survey also shows that the driving forces for working slightly more have 
increased  since  the  1990s,  but  also  that  they  are  relatively  low  among  the  lower  income  groups.5 
While a high level of compensation means increased security for the individual in the case of loss of 
income,  if  the  negative  effects  on  labour  supply  are  large,  they  will  also  entail  substantial  costs  to 
society as a whole. 
It is important to remember that what I have taken up here is the effects on the labour market’s supply 
side. But the total effect on the labour market is determined by the interaction between the supply side 
and the demand side. If one wishes to affect the functioning of the labour market more radically, it is 
probably necessary to implement structural policy measures that will influence both sides. Economic 
driving  forces  are  certainly  not  the  only  method  of  influencing  the  labour  supply.  Nor  is  it  useful  to 
focus solely on the size of the compensation levels. The challenge will be to ensure that the various 
insurance  and  benefit  systems  provide  the  necessary  basic  safety  net  but  still  maintain  a  strong 
impetus for people to begin work again. It will probably be necessary to make both general changes in 
insurance  and  benefit  systems  and  selective  measures  to  raise  labour  force  participation  in  groups 
where the potential to increase the work input is considered relatively large. Examples of these groups 
are younger people, older people and people born abroad. 
Conclusion 
Let  me  finally  return  to  my  starting  point  and  the  discussion  of  long-term  growth.  I  have  mainly 
concentrated on the relationship between potential growth and monetary policy. However, we must not 
forget  that  long-term  growth  has  significance  for  all  parts  of  the  economy  and  one  of  the  most 
important goals for economic policy in general is to promote a high level of long-term growth. Growth 
is not the same thing as increased wealth, but growth creates a foundation for increased wealth. It 
creates greater scope not just for households’ private consumption, but also for financing, for instance, 
education  systems  of  high  quality  and  a  good  level  of  care  and  welfare  and  provides  better 
opportunities to achieve other political goals. 
Potential growth sets the framework for monetary policy. Simplified, one can say that the Riksbank’s 
task  is  to  keep  actual  output  as  close  to  potential  output  as  possible.  The  higher  the  long-term 
sustainable growth rate, the higher the actual growth rate can be without resource utilisation becoming 
so high that inflation takes off and the Riksbank is forced to intervene to subdue demand. However, 
the Riksbank cannot do much to affect long-term developments in growth. This is governed by other 
factors, particularly productivity development and labour supply. 
Productivity  growth  improved  substantially  from  the  mid-1990s  and  has  since  remained  at  a  much 
higher  level  than  during  the  1980s.  It  is  probable  that  several  factors  lie  behind  this  development, 
including  macroeconomic  stabilisation,  increased  openness  towards  the  outside  world  and  tougher 
competition. Up to the beginning of the 21st century, the increase in productivity growth also reflected 
the expansion of the IT sector and investments made in information technology. The question is now 
to what extent this development is permanent. Our assessment in the October Inflation Report is that 
economic activity has to some extent had a positive effect on recent developments and that the rate of 
increase in productivity will therefore fall over the coming years - although probably to an average level 
above that of the 1980s.

The number of hours worked has also developed relatively favourably since the mid-1990s. Growth 
has been good and this has contributed to maintaining demand for working hours. At the same time, 
demographic  developments  have  been  relatively  favourable  and  there  have  been  ample  unutilised 
resources  in  the  economy  following  the  crisis  of  the  1990s.  However,  when  it  comes  to  the  labour 
supply,  there  is  less  reason  to  be  optimistic  about  future  developments.  Developments  in  working 
hours have been held back during recent periods for structural reasons. The demographic situation, 
with a declining percentage of the population of working age, will deteriorate significantly in the long 
term, particularly after 2010. In addition, working hours per person may instead tend to decline in the 
long run when greater prosperity is taken advantage of to increase leisure time. 
The  assessment  in  the  October  Inflation  Report  is  that  employment,  labour  force  participation  and 
mean  working  time  will  rise  during  the  economic  upturn  forecast  for  the  coming  years  and  will 
contribute to an increase in the number of hours worked of approximately 1 per cent a year during the 
period. In a longer perspective, it is more realistic to assume that the labour supply will not make any 
contribution to growth. The simulations in, for instance, the Long-term Planning Commission’s most 
recent  report,  indicate  that  the  number  of  hours  worked  on  average  will  not  show  any  significant 
change. However, the simulations show that the situation could be improved significantly, at least in 
the short term, if measures were taken to increase the labour supply. 
The Riksbank has chosen not to specify any exact figure for potential growth, but instead has decided 
to state a range of between 2 and 2.5 per cent. We have not considered it possible to be more precise 
than this, given the difficulties in measuring growth, etc. If we look ahead, it is reasonable to believe 
that growth will in future be somewhere within this interval, although where depends on how far ahead 
one looks. Over the coming years, growth will probably be closer to 2.5 per cent than to 2 per cent. In 
the  longer  perspective,  when  the  demographic  effects  on  the  labour  supply  are  greater,  it  is 
reasonable to believe in a figure closer to 2 per cent than 2.5 per cent. How much closer depends to a 
great extent on how much the labour supply can be stimulated during the period.
