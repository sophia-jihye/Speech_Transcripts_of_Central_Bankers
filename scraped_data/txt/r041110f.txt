Villy Bergström: Is the Riksbank to blame for unemployment?  
Speech by Mr Villy Bergström, Deputy Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, at Brunnsvik adult education 
college for trade union officials, Brunnsvik, 4 November 2004. 
 Thank you for the invitation to come to Brunnsvik to speak about the Riksbank and how we work. 
Over the past ten years, Sweden’s macroeconomic performance has been relatively robust, both in 
comparison with other OECD countries and with the economic performance of the 1970s and 1980s. 
But there are problem areas, and I intend today to discuss perhaps the most serious of these - the 
employment situation. 
It’s  natural  in  the  employment  debate  that  questions  are  put  to  the  Riksbank,  since  our  conduct  of 
monetary  policy  affects  short-term  economic  developments.  This  makes  it  tempting  to  criticise  the 
Riksbank  and  to  expect  us  to  be  able  to  solve  the  employment  problems  through  a  looser,  more 
inflation-tolerant  monetary  policy.  However,  the  experiences  of  many  decades  of  research  and  of 
actual economic developments are unambiguous: inflation is no solution to unemployment problems. 
To  elucidate  this  it’s  important  to  differentiate  between  two  issues:  on  the  one  hand  the  long-term 
relationship  between  a  stable,  low  inflation  rate  -  which  is  the  Riksbank’s  statutory  objective  -  and 
employment. On the other hand the impact of monetary policy on economic activity and employment in 
the  short  term.  The  latter  issue  has  been  discussed  more  and  more  in  the  public  domain  recently, 
where  it  has  been  claimed  that  excessively  tight  monetary  policy  has  resulted  in  the  loss  of  up  to 
75,000 jobs, as if a simple relationship existed between interest rate decisions and jobs. 
Allow me to begin with a retrospective approach to address the issue of monetary policy’s effects on 
employment in the long run. 
Employment and inflation in the long term - a retrospective view 
During the first decades of the post-war era, one of the fundamental theses of Keynes’ legacy was that 
there was a direct trade-off between unemployment and inflation, implying that decision-makers could 
secure lower unemployment by allowing inflation to rise. Inflation was moderate and full employment 
was achieved. 
Owing to this line of reasoning, the fight against inflation was completely overshadowed by demand 
management.  In  addition,  the  power  of  monetary  policy  was  constrained  by  the  exchange-rate 
cooperation  at  that  time  -  Bretton  Woods  -  which  had  a  fixed  exchange  rate  as  its  target.  When  I 
started  my  economics  education  in  the  early  1960s,  monetary  policy  revolved  around  quantitative 
controls of the credit market. Interest in stabilisation policy theory was instead tied to fiscal policy. The 
economics curriculum focused on the impact of fiscal policy on demand developments. How big are 
the multiplier effects of public expenditures, tax changes and expenditures financed in different ways? 
The supply side, i.e. the issue of the long-term sustainable growth rate under full capacity utilisation, 
was almost entirely overlooked. Even growth theory was sometimes based on demand analysis rather 
than on the growth of the factors of production and on technological progress. 
During this period, full employment was the top priority of Swedish economic policy, as is evident in 
every fiscal plan from the 1950s and 1960s. The idea was that full employment involved a small rate of 
frictional unemployment of around 2.5 per cent, even though the level was never stated explicitly in 
policy  documents.  That  level  was  assumed  to  correspond  to  people  that  at  the  time  of  each 
measurement were in the process of changing jobs or in the process of leaving the education system 
to  enter  the  labour  market  or  similar.  According  to  the  prevalent  view,  higher  unemployment  could 
always be explained by insufficient demand. 
It was generally accepted among professional economists and the public that the government could 
fine-tune the economy with the aid of fiscal policy - expenditures, tax receipts and tax structures. It 
was a question of bridging the cyclical slumps. These ideas prevailed on both sides of the Atlantic, 
even though there was a school of sceptics both in Europe and the United States.

This  policy  was  highly  successful  for  a  long  time.  For  the  greater  part  of  the  post-war  period, 
unemployment in Sweden remained clearly below 4 per cent. On an annual basis it did not exceed 
4 per cent at any time between 1950 and 1990. 
Why didn’t the successes last? In order to properly understand what happened, we must consider the 
gradual  shift  that  occurred  in  expectations  and  in  economic  policy  during  the  post-war  period.  The 
thinking at the beginning of that period was still marked by the interwar period’s mass unemployment 
but also by the price stability of that time. Prices fell during some periods and rose during others. On 
the whole, the price level was stable during the 1930s, which was also the Riksbank’s explicit target at 
the  time.  Inflation  expectations  during  the  first  post-war  period  were  marked  by  these  experiences, 
even to such an extent that the government prior to the post-war period announced in advance that 
the  price  level  would  fall  as  the  productivity  gains  from  the  transition  to  peacetime  production 
materialised. 
As the general price level actually rose, but never dropped, the public’s expectations of inflation were 
influenced  accordingly.  Expectations  of  rising  prices  worked  their  way  slowly  into  people’s  minds. 
During the period 1956-64, the general level of prices increased on average by 3.4 per cent a year; 
during the period 1965-74 by 5.6 per cent and from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s by an average of 
8.1 per cent a year. Between 1973 and 1982, Sweden devalued the krona six times after the Bretton 
Woods system, with its fixed exchange rates, had been abandoned. By the end of the 1980s, following 
successive increases in the inflation rate and repeated devaluations, inflation expectations had been 
anchored  at  a  high  level.  It  became  increasingly  obvious  that  the  trade-off  between  inflation  and 
unemployment  that  had  previously  been  taken  for  granted  did  not  apply,  that  each  new  attempt  to 
raise employment by expanding demand only resulted eventually in increasingly higher inflation (see 
Chart 1). 
It is easy to understand why. When inflation rises, it affects the wage demands in the next round of 
wage  negotiations.  Wage-earners  are  interested  in  the  actual  purchasing  power  of  their  wage  and 
structure their wage demands accordingly. Inflation thus increases without any effect on employment. 
The conclusion is that in the long run there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment. 
But even though inflation does not have any long-term impact on employment, it does affect economic 
growth  and  welfare.  High  inflation  disrupts  the  mechanism  by  which  goods’  relative  values  are 
signalled via prices, and distorts the reasons to save. This problem is perhaps especially significant for 
investment when the return is expected to be yielded over a long period in the future. In such cases, 
uncertainty over price developments can have a curbing effect. Furthermore, there is an increase in 
uncertainty about future developments in wages and costs, making it more difficult for agents in an 
economy  to  make  economic  decisions.  Lenders  may  decide  to  set  a  higher  rate  of  interest  to 
compensate for any rise in inflation, and firms may decide not to invest in new machinery or to hire 
employees. 
The experiences during the 1970s and 1980s contributed to the formation of the new monetary policy 
regime, which targets low, stable inflation. The inflation target has been set at 2 per cent. That level 
allows  some  leeway  to  zero  inflation,  which,  among  other  things,  reduces  the  risk  of  deflation  and 
enables adjustments in relative wages without normally requiring nominal wage decreases for different 
groups in the labour market. 
On  the  whole,  as  I  mentioned,  it  has  also  worked  well.  Inflation  has  fallen  at  the  same  time  as 
economic  growth  has  been  relatively  high  compared  with  the  immediately  preceding  decades  (see 
Chart 2). Unemployment has gradually declined since the crisis in the early 1990s, even though it is 
considerably higher than in the 1960s.  
After the introduction of the inflation target, we thereby had maybe the clearest evidence that there is 
no trade-off between inflation and unemployment since both fell at the same time during the 1990s. 
The  absence  of  a  long-term  relationship  between  inflation  and  unemployment  has  also  been 
confirmed by extensive studies in a large number of OECD countries. 
Monetary policy and employment in the short term 
Having  now  spoken  about  the  Riksbank’s  inability  to  influence  employment  in  the  long  run,  the 
question remains of how monetary policy can affect employment in the short term. Monetary policy 
can have a short-term impact on economic activity and therefore at best reduce the fluctuations in the 
cyclically determined component of unemployment.

 BIS Review 65/2004
Monetary  policy  is  estimated  to  affect  inflation  1-2  years  ahead.  Consequently,  monetary  policy 
decisions are based on a forecast of future inflation. It is difficult, however, to keep inflation perfectly in 
check.  It  may  deviate  from  the  inflation  target,  due,  for  instance,  to  unexpected  events  or  political 
decisions.  Likewise  there  may  sometimes  be  reason,  in  the  event  of  a  sharp  deviation,  to  return 
inflation slowly to the target so as to avoid substantial real economic costs. But like other forecasters, 
the Riksbank can of course also make mistakes in its forecasting. For all these reasons inflation may 
be above target during some periods, and be below target during others. In order to take account of 
and clearly reflect this reality, the inflation target is set within a tolerance band of ± 1 percentage point. 
In exceptional cases, this tolerance band can also be exceeded during short periods. Fortunately it 
seems that the Riksbank’s forecasting ability has at least not been poorer than most other forecasters’, 
possibly even somewhat better. 
As you might guess the Riksbank doesn’t receive any congratulatory telegrams for creating thousands 
of new jobs when we overshoot the inflation target by a few tenths of a percentage point, but when we 
undershoot to the same extent some economists are quick to put a price on the miss in the shape of 
lost  jobs.  We  welcome  all  criticism  that  is  underpinned  by  solid  analysis,  since  it  enables  us  to 
enhance our forecasting ability. However, I think it’s important to clarify a number of points regarding 
the  criticism  in  which  a  number  of  commentators  have  claimed  that  the  Riksbank’s  actions  have 
caused the loss of 20,000 to 75,000 jobs. 
The first is that we have an entirely symmetric approach to deviations from the target. It is just as bad 
to undershoot the target as to overshoot it. Sometimes I get the impression that at least some of the 
criticism is based on the idea that the Riksbank has some kind of “hidden agenda” that is leading us to 
deliberately try to keep inflation below our set target, or at least that we think it’s less problematic if 
inflation is below target than above it. I can assure you that we have no such “hidden agenda”. The 
Riksbank always aims to meet the inflation target. 
The  second  is  that  there  is  no  such  simple  relationship  between  interest  rate  decisions  and 
unemployment,  as  the  criticism  suggests.  Were  the  repo  rate  able  to  steer  developments  in  the 
economy so directly, inflation targeting would be much easier, but this is not the case. The economy is 
exposed to new shocks all the time, and it is difficult to discern their significance and how they can be 
countered by monetary policy. What the Riksbank can do, in a complex world, is to influence resource 
utilisation  and  economic  activity  so  that  inflationary  tendencies  are  kept  fairly  well  in  check,  at  the 
same  time  as  a  host  of  other  factors  affect  employment  in  parallel  and  interact  with  the  monetary 
policy effects. In this work we try to avoid unnecessary fluctuations in output and employment, but we 
are not able to fine-tune the economy exactly. 
The fact that the Riksbank’s power to influence employment is both short-term and relatively limited is 
not inconsistent with our ability to keep inflation in check. The latter is normally achieved by affecting 
inflation expectations. As long as our monetary policy is credible, it is enough to make small interest 
rate adjustments to keep inflation close to target. In this way, the Riksbank sends out a signal that it is 
keeping a close eye on inflationary tendencies and everyone knows that stronger measures await if 
inflation expectations take off in either direction. 
So, there is no simple relationship between monetary policy and employment. Nevertheless, for the 
sake of argument, let’s go along with our critics and assume that such a relationship exists. In that 
case, estimates merely show that even if the repo rate had been a full percentage point too high for a 
whole year, the effect on today’s employment situation would at most have been a few thousand jobs, 
and  not  the  tens  of  thousands  claimed  by  the  Riksbank’s  critics.  In  light  of  this,  claims  that  the 
Riksbank is to blame for the loss of tens of thousands of jobs are rather questionable. Neither have 
our critics, despite requests, presented any convincing estimates to support this view. I think it’s a poor 
show on the part of government officials, trade union economists and trade union leaders to accuse 
the Riksbank of bringing unemployment upon tens of thousands of people. 
An interesting addition in this regard is that the most recent periods when inflation has been below 
target, at the end of the 1990s and the beginning of this decade, have been marked by unexpectedly 
high productivity and unexpectedly low imported inflation (which few forecasters had anticipated). So 
it’s not the case that the low inflation is a result of the Riksbank actively tightening monetary policy and 
dampening demand. On the contrary, these have been situations in which interest rates have been 
low.  In  spite  of  that,  inflation  has  been  weak  owing  to  positive  supply  shocks.  The  impact  of  these 
shocks on employment differs from the effect produced by excessively tight monetary policy. Too low 
inflation due to high productivity growth and cheap intermediate goods stimulates growth, demand and 
employment. Consequently, the price of missing the inflation target has likely been lower in terms of 
BIS Review 65/2004

growth  and  employment  than  if  the  cause  had  been  a  sharp  monetary  tightening  that  had  caused 
demand to drop and inflation to fall. 
The fact that employment depends on a number of other factors than monetary policy decisions and 
cyclical  variations  is  illustrated,  among  other  things,  by  the  miscalculations  of  the  National  Labour 
Market Board just prior to 2004. In November last year the Board estimated that Swedish economic 
growth would be 1.4 per cent in 2003 and 1.9 per cent this year, while unemployment was forecast to 
be 5.1 per cent this year. Moreover, the Board believed that the repo rate should be cut from 2.75 to 
2.25-2.5 per cent. These forecasts were roughly in line with those of the Riksbank at that time, with the 
exception that we, as usual, based our forecasts on the assumption that the repo rate would be kept 
unchanged. A year later we can say that economic growth has exceeded both the National Labour 
Market Board’s and our expectations at the same time as the monetary stance has become looser. 
Nevertheless,  labour  market  growth  has  been  weaker.  This  shows  both  that  forecasters  can  be 
surprised  by  unexpected  developments  in  the  economy  and  that  unemployment  at  present  is  not 
chiefly  due  to  insufficient  demand  for  goods  and  services  owing  to  low  growth  and  tight  monetary 
policy.

Structural policy measures needed for a better functioning labour market 
So, the weak employment growth is, in my opinion, not primarily a result of low demand for goods and 
services in the economy - the economy is growing by between 3 and 4 per cent a year - but instead 
has to do with the rapid structural change that puts increasingly high demands on the functioning of 
the labour market. I now intend to touch upon these structural problems. 
Firstly, the employment problem is even bigger than that reflected in open unemployment data. At the 
beginning  of  the  1990s  the  supply  of  labour  dropped  at  the  same  time  as  employment  fell,  which 
meant that the decline in employment was not fully mirrored in unemployment figures. It is a common 
pattern for both the size of the labour force and employment to be correlated with economic activity. 
When activity weakens, it leads not only to a fall in employment but also to a decrease in the number 
of people who say that they want to work. This is natural when people know that it’s difficult to get a 
job. But despite historically high economic growth, the employment rate has not recovered since its 
steep decline in connection with the crisis in the early 1990s. A large proportion of the working age 
population is still outside the labour force, which implies that there in practice is considerable hidden 
unemployment 
that  open 
unemployment has not fallen more during the 1990s’ economic boom indicates that the labour market 
does not function satisfactorily. 
Another sign that the unemployment problems are structural in nature is the big differences between 
regions  and  between  occupational  categories.  In  spite  of  a  single  monetary  policy  for  the  entire 
Swedish  economy,  unemployment  figures  in  some  regions  are  double  those  in  others,  while  the 
proportion  of  people  receiving  benefit  from  their  unemployment  fund  is  twice  as  high  in  some 
occupational  categories  as  in  others  (see  Charts  3  and  4).  These  differences  seem  to  remain  over 
long  periods,  indicating  low  mobility  in  the  jobs  market.  Another  possible  indication  of  such 
shortcomings  is  that  the  same  vacancy  ratio  today  is  combined  with  somewhat  higher  total 
unemployment than 15-20 years ago. 
At the same time there is a large, growing need for mobility in the labour market. A comparison of 
different sectors’ employment growth during periods of expansion and contraction shows that many 
sectors suffer from job losses in both upturns and downturns, while others see jobs created both in 
upturns and downturns. The old cyclical pattern, where jobs are shed during a slump and are then 
created  once  the  economy  turns  around,  no  longer  appears  to  hold  true.  Jobs  that  are  lost  in  a 
slowdown are being replaced, especially in manufacturing, to some degree by increased productivity 
and  information  technology.  Growth  is  leading  to  new  jobs  but  in  different  areas  than  before.  This 
means  that  more  people  have  to  change  workplace  or  sector,  which  in  turn  requires  considerable 
adaptability. More jobs have to be created in, for example, the services sector, perhaps in completely 
new firms. 
Consequently, high growth does not necessarily imply increased job security in the traditional sense. 
Instead, high growth may reflect rapid change and high productivity growth, and that more jobs are 
disappearing in some parts of the economy at the same time as new jobs need to be created in other 
areas. This pattern has been observed in the United States in the debate on jobless growth. 
fact

 BIS Review 65/2004
This trend is reinforced by firms’ increased possibilities to outsource parts of their production to other 
countries,  a  phenomenon  that  has  recently  been  getting  more  and  more  attention  in  the  economic 
debate. Several studies from the United States, where outsourcing is considered especially extensive, 
show that the direct effect on employment is fairly small. However, there is an indirect effect since the 
pressure to change increases, i.e. the need for staff decreases in some sectors but rises in others. 
In  such  a  time  of  rapid  structural  change,  the  cost  of  low  labour-market  mobility  increases,  while  it 
becomes more important that new firms and jobs are created. More people will find themselves in a 
transition between companies and between sectors, and sometimes between residential locations. If 
the incentives are low for workers to quickly change jobs and move to a new sector, at the same time 
as the incentives for firms to employ labour from a different sector are reduced by high initial wages, 
costs of sick leave and job security, there is a risk that more people will get stuck in the transition. This 
would entail a rise in frictional unemployment. In addition, the risk of long-term unemployment rises if 
more people become discouraged and stop looking actively for work. 
The Swedish labour market has previously functioned efficiently in these respects. Think of the closing 
down of almost the entire textile industry and of the shutdown of the Swedish shipyards at the same 
time  as  the  paper  and  pulp  industry  and  the  iron  and  steel  industry  were  rationalised  considerably 
during  the  1970s.  Not  least  the  trade  union  movement,  more  specifically  the  Swedish  Trade  Union 
Confederation, helped facilitate structural change. Read the official reports from 1941, 1951 and 1961 
for the Confederation’s conferences in those years. The findings of these reports are something we 
need to take in today. The trade union movement realised that structural change was the prerequisite 
for increasing real wages and for generally higher prosperity. 
Conclusions 
I  believe  that  it’s  fully  possible  with  the  right  methods  to  achieve  both  an  employment  rate  that  is 
sharply higher and an unemployment rate that is considerably lower than today’s level. It is important, 
however, that the fundamental cause of the unemployment is discussed seriously and that the calls for 
change are directed at those who actually have the power to carry out the required changes. 
All factual criticism of the Riksbank’s forecasts is good, but there’s a risk of concentrating the debate 
on our interest rate decisions and of the Riksbank’s deviations from the inflation target, the effects of 
which are transitory and even themselves out over time, overshadowing other, much more important 
factors that really can affect employment in the long run. We risk forgetting the much more powerful 
tools  that  other  decision-makers,  outside  the  Riksbank,  have  at  their  disposal  to  influence 
employment. What is relevant is not why unemployment is 5.8 per cent instead of 5.0 per cent but 
rather why it is not 4 per cent or even lower on average over an economic cycle. Equally important is 
why the employment rate has continued to drop in Sweden since the 1980s. 
In my opinion, measures must be taken to enhance the functioning of the labour market. The demands 
are increasing in line with the global trends that we’ve seen in recent years in the shape of outsourcing 
and technological progress. 
I have never believed that the shift in regime to a low-inflation policy would make it impossible to return 
to full employment according to the old norm even in the long run. I would not have taken the job I 
have now if I wasn’t convinced that it is possible to combine low unemployment with low inflation, as in 
the first decades after the Second World War. I understood and criticised the fact that the transition 
from high inflation would be costly in terms of temporary job losses and a decline in income. But that 
cost is now behind us and the conditions are in place for a lower level of unemployment in the long 
run. However, this requires a willingness to discuss the real causes of the weak employment growth in 
Sweden.
