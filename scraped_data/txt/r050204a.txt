David Dodge: Summary of the latest Monetary Policy Report 
Opening  statement  by  Mr  David  Dodge,  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Canada,  at  a  press  conference 
following the release of the Monetary Policy Report Update, Ottawa, 27 January 2005.  
 Today, we released the Update to our October Monetary Policy Report. The Update reviews economic 
and financial trends in the context of Canada’s inflation-control strategy. 
The outlook for the Canadian economy continues to be shaped by global developments, including the 
realignment of world currencies. The near-term outlook for the global economy is a touch weaker than 
projected  in  the  October  Report,  but more  solidly based because of somewhat  lower  oil prices  and 
greater confidence in the momentum of the U.S. economy.  
We expect the Canadian economy to operate a little further below its full production capacity in 2005 
than  was  anticipated  at  the  time  of  the  last  Report,  largely  reflecting  the  dampening  effects  on 
aggregate demand of the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar.  
For 2006, we project growth to pick up to slightly more than 3 per cent, consistent with returning the 
economy  to  its  production  capacity  in  the  second  half  of  the  year,  and  returning  core  inflation  to 
2 per cent around the end of 2006.  
In line with this revised outlook, the pace of reduction in monetary stimulus is likely to be slower than 
that envisioned in the October Report.  
There  are  both  upside  and  downside  risks  around  the  outlook,  which  continue  to  relate  to  the 
adjustment  to  global  developments.  As  circumstances  change,  we  always  need  to  be  ready  to 
re-assess the policy implications.
