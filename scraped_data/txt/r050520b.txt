Süreyya Serdengeçti: Basic changes in the Turkish economy - problems and 
solutions 
Opening speech by Mr Süreyya Serdengeçti, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, 
on  the  occasion  of  the  73rd  Shareholders’  Ordinary  General  Meeting  of  the  Central  Bank  of  the 
Republic of Turkey, Ankara, 12 April 2005. 
 Esteemed Shareholders, Distinguished Guests and Dear Members of the Press; Welcome to the 73rd 
Shareholders’ Ordinary General Meeting of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey. 
Before I begin my speech, I would like to share with you the happiness that we have this year been 
able to achieve the single digit inflation figures that we have wished for many years and the Turkish 
lira has once again gained credibility. The main framework of my speech will cover the process that 
has brought us up to this point and what we need to do in order to achieve and maintain price stability. 
In other words, leaving aside the shallow evaluations stuck in the triangle of FX rates-exchange rates-
interest rates-stock market rates; the core of my speech today will focus on apart the basic changes in 
the economy, deep-rooted problems and the ways out of these problems.  
The Turkish economy has faced a problem of almost 30-years of high and chronic inflation. During this 
period, many programs have been implemented to push down inflation. In the same period, inflation 
has at times relatively declined, but it was impossible to maintain a permanent recovery that could be 
identified as price stability. 
During the period between the first half of the 1970s and the early 1980s, studies and applications to 
fight  inflation  and  to  maintain  price  stability  in  developed  economies  intensified,  whereas  inflation 
accelerated due to the financing of public deficit by the Central Bank. 
In the second half of 1980s, the inertia arising the Central Bank meeting public deficits brought about 
abandoning of discipline in public expenditure changes in production-consumption behavior together 
with inflation and deterioration in the social structure. In the early 90s, apart from relatively short-term 
periods of stability, lax fiscal policies continued to be implemented along with monetary policies aimed 
at  preventing  a  possible  crisis.  Price  stability  was  not  a  priority,  moreover,  inflation  entered  a  self-
fulfilling cycle. It is a fact that during this 30-year period, price stability was not the main objective and 
the necessary structural arrangements for maintaining economic stability, including price stability and 
sustainable growth, were not taken into consideration.  
This period of long-term chronic inflation brought with it a lot of negativity. As it is known, price stability 
is  the  sine  qua  non  for  maintaining  economic  and  social  stability.  The  extent  of  the  damage  to  the 
economy  as  well  as  political  and  social  structure  of  a  country  caused  by  failing  to  achieve  price 
stability is clearly in the in the state of the country during this period and in the experiences of other 
countries. At this point, it is important to underline once more the damage caused by high inflation in 
order to remind us why should do everything in our power to stick to the price stability objective. This is 
especially  important  in  an  environment  where  the  benefits  of  overcoming  inflation  are  not  yet  fully 
understood.  
The consequences of failure to maintain price stability, in other words, the damage caused by inflation, 
can be clearly seen in our country both in society and in the economy, as is the case in all countries 
that have experienced high and chronic inflation.  
High inflation, one of the main reasons for poverty, depravation, unfair distribution of income, and the 
economic instability environment it creates has been one of the most influential impacts of inflation on 
society. The legacy of inflation on poverty, depravation and the unfair distribution of income have been 
clearly felt by society.  
Another effect of high inflation, which manifested itself in the short-term in society, is that of immoral 
behavior. High inflation led to moral corruption in our country. While Turkey ranked low in fields such 
as  infrastructure,  education,  health  and  the  fair  distribution  of  income  in  international  development 
indicators, it ranked high in indices of corruption.  
Another factor worth mentioning in this context is the relationship between high inflation and political 
instability.  Shortsighted  policies  by  political  instability  and  the  resulting  inflation  as  a  result  have 
BIS Review 36/2005

featured  several  times  in  economic  literature.  However,  the  other  side  of  causality  has  not  been 
mentioned  much.  Economic  instability  triggered  by  inflation  is  one  of  the  main  factors  that  leads  to 
political  instability.  In  other  words,  political  instability  creates  inflation  and  inflation  invokes  political 
instability. Hence, high inflation and political instability create a vicious circle. 
When we look at the effects of high inflation on the economic sphere, we see that deposit savers put 
most of their savings into unproductive areas such as foreign currency and real estate with the aim of 
protecting themselves from the impacts of an inflationary environment. However, keeping most of their 
savings as foreign currency has achieved nothing and created real revenue loss. This is due to the 
fact that for economic units, the long-term revenue of foreign currency remained below the revenues of 
Turkish lira assets, despite devaluations in the Turkish lira.  
When we look at this from the investment angle, since there is a kind of tax burden on investments, 
this creates an additional cost for investors and causes seasonal volatility in investment. This leads to 
diversifications in economic growth rates. As a result, growth rates drop in countries experiencing high 
inflation in the long-run, moreover the quality of growth deteriorates. The average growth in the last 20 
years  in  Turkey  has  lagged  behind  most  of  the  developing countries.  In  our  country, continual  high 
inflation, apart from having a negative impact on economic growth, has led to the erosion of the quality 
of products and services and has caused an unrelenting regression in our competitiveness. However, 
competition  indexes  show  that  the  devaluation  of  the  Turkish  lira  do  not  increase  Turkey’s 
competitiveness in any way. 
The unfavorable impact of high inflation has also been the felt in the labor market and prevented it 
from  functioning  effectively.  Economic  growth  within  continuous  expansion  and  contraction  cycles 
made the labor force volatile. Those, who want to work in this volatile environment, especially unskilled 
workers,  are  the  first  ones  to  lose  their  jobs  in  periods  of  contraction  and  the  last  ones  that  are 
employed in expansion periods. This means that the period of high and chronic inflation experienced 
by Turkey is one of the underlying reasons for social problems triggered by the fact that sustainable 
employment growth has yet to be achieved. 
Meanwhile, alongside the tendency of currency substitution with high and volatile risk premium created 
by high inflation, real interests, which were high due to the problematic public debts, caused a debt 
spiral  and  the  vulnerability  of  the  economy  to  exogenous  shocks  increased.  This  situation  both 
clouded expectations and hindered the effective utilization of monetary policy 
Inflation diminished the effectiveness of financial markets to intermediate. This is due to the fact that, 
in a highly inflationary environment, players in the market are unable to foresee the future as they lack 
the  appropriate  knowledge.  This  situation,  combined  with  the  problem  of  public  deficit,  led  to  a 
significant decline in the credits that the banking sector provides to the non-financial sector. Therefore, 
the banking sector failed to fulfill its core function as a provider of resources for the economy. At the 
same  time,  risk  management  principles  were  not  put  into  practice  in  the  banking  system  and  the 
consequences were apparent in the 2000-2001 crises. 
Another  unfavorable  impact  of  high  and  chronic  inflation  on  the  economy  in  our  country  is  that 
economic units became used to operating in a highly inflationary environment. To put it more clearly, 
backward  indexing  behavior  became  common  in  pricing  activities.  Thus,  wall  of  inertia  evolved  in 
inflation,  which  was  difficult  to  break.  Here  “inflation  inertia”  simply  refers  to  the  situation  of, 
yesterday’s  inflation  designating  today’s  inflation  and  today’s  inflation  designating  future  inflation. 
Hence, as inflation increased, inflation expectations increased with it and a self-nurturing inflation cycle 
began. 
In a period of high and chronic inflation, consumers were not inclined to control price and quality less 
and were also less concerned about diversity in selecting products. At the same time, producers were 
less  concerned  with  cost  and  efficiency  while  pricing  and  were  willing  to  determine  profit  margins 
freely, and invest less on increasing product diversity.  
As a result of this behavior created by the inflation process, goods and services could be sold at any 
price since consumers did not control prices, while producers did not control cost. Thus, this attitude 
provoked  a  resistance  against  anti-inflationary  policies  that  were  introduced  at  intervals  and 
significantly  slowed  down  the  decline  of  inflation.  In  other  words,  the  main  inertia,  which  needed 
breaking,  was  that  stemming  from  the  resistance  in  peoples’  minds.  This  resistance  still  exists  and 
repeatedly  stands  in  the  way  of  stability  programs  and  efforts.  However,  since  it  is  gradually  being 
understood that inflation is also a moral issue, the fight against inflation is no longer the direct target.

 BIS Review 36/2005
My ideas on the fight against inflation are presented in detail the interview given on January 16, 2005, 
which is available on our website.  
To  sum  up,  the  protracted  chronic  inflation  made  our  economy  highly  vulnerable.  It  hindered  the 
establishment of macroeconomic balances in the long run. Consequently, it induced a heavy cost on 
both our economy and social life. 
During the last three years, we have repeatedly explained the damage caused by inflation in every 
possible platform. Today we are content to see that a significant part of the society agrees with us. In 
the rest of my speech, I would like to focus on where we stand on fighting inflation, how we got here 
and what should to be done to preserve these gains and maintain price stability.  
With strict and efficient implementation of the economic program devised after the crisis, the thirty-year 
period of chronic inflation has come to an end in our country, and the focus has shifted to the declining 
inflation  environment  and  permanence  of  price  stability.  Besides,  there  is  a  persistent  and  visible 
recovery in inflation dynamics, and thus the inflation inertia has, to a great extent, been. 
When we consider where we are after four years of fighting inflation following the crisis, we see that 
CPI inflation, which was 73.2 percent by January 2002, remained below the end year targets for three 
consecutive years, declining to single digit figures; annual CPI is realized as 7.94 percent in March 
2005.  The  total  decline  in  inflation  during  this  period  was  more  than  65  percent.  This  favorable 
development  was  apparent  in  the  expectations  as  well.  While  the  reliability  difference,  which  is  the 
difference between target inflation and inflation expectations, was 13.3 point at the beginning of 2002, 
it dropped to 0.4 points at the beginning of 2005. As of today, according to the results of the survey of 
expectations of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, the year-end inflation expectation dropped 
to  7.5  percent.  This  figure  is  below  the  official  target  of  8  percent.  As  well  as  being  a  concrete 
indication of the fact that the inflation inertia has been broken to a great extent, this improvement in 
inflation expectations is clear evidence of the increased confidence in monetary policy.  
Moreover, this situation shows that the inflation target will be a nominal anchor for economic units in 
their future decisions.

In 2004, there were high increases in world commodity prices; mostly in oil and primary metal prices 
and in April and May there were fluctuations in the financial markets. Despite these developments, the 
fact that the inflation target was realized is owing to coherent implementation of disciplined monetary 
and  financial  policies.  In  addition,  there  are  four  other  main  factors  that  contributed  to  the  steady

decline of inflation; the controlled recovery of domestic demand, the continual increase of productivity 
in the economy, income policies almost coherent with inflation, and relative stability in FX rates.  
The inflation figures of the first quarter of 2005 indicate that the positive outlook in price developments 
continues. In the new index with a 2003 basis year, the tendency to decline persists in the special CPI 
aggregates  which  were  formed  by  adjusting  inflation  according  to  external  factors-  such  as  raw 
material prices around the world, prices affected by natural causes or determined by the public. In the 
first quarter of 2005 cumulative inflation figures remained historically low.  
At  this  point,  instead  of  going  into  detail  about  the  inflation  outlook,  I  suggest  that  you  refer  to  the 
press release “March Inflation and Outlook”, which is available on our website.

I would like to briefly consider the underlying reasons for the success of the fight against inflation. 
Along with the issues mentioned above, the implementation of firm and sound policies and important 
institutional reforms are crucial to the decline of years of inflation and finally getting rid of the label; “a 
country with chronic high inflation”.  
The first, and perhaps the most significant institutional development, is that the institutional structure of 
our Bank has become conducive to maintaining price stability. As you know, in 2001, in amendments 
to  its  law,  the  main  purpose  of  the  Central  Bank  of  the  Republic  of  Turkey  was  designated  as 
maintaining  price  stability  and  the  Bank  was  given  the  mandate  to  directly  determine  necessary 
monetary policy and monetary policy instruments.  
Another essential change made in Central Bank law was the prohibition of advances and credits to the 
Treasury and public institutions and establishments. As is known, public expenditures can be financed 
through collecting taxes, privatization, borrowing from domestic and foreign markets or Central Bank’s 
resources.  Financing  through  Central  Bank  resources  may  cause  inflationist  pressures  due  to 
increases in ‘fiduciary’ supply. Therefore conducting monetary policy independently and preventing the 
use of Central Bank resources in public financing are significant factors for removing this effect. It is 
not a coincidence that in our country inflation followed a declining trend after November 2001, when 
the provision of public credit was prohibited. It has since dropped to single digit figures after 30 years. 
Another contributory factor to be mentioned in the process of fighting inflation is the communication 
policy  of  the  Central  Bank.  The  significance  of  efficient  communication  is  undeniable  in  reducing 
ambiguity and increasing reliability by making Central Bank policies understandable, assessable and 
predictable. Since 2001, the Central Bank has placed communication policy at the core of its policies;

and consequently adopted an efficient policy, sharing all knowledge and forecasts with the public and 
explained its policies clearly throughout the country. I think efficient communication is highly important 
in terms of the point we have reached today. 
Besides  central  bank  independence  and  communication  strategies,  the  tight  fiscal  and  monetary 
policies implemented are two other important factors in the fight against inflation. It is very well known 
that it is really hard to implement price stability-oriented monetary policies in an environment of fiscal 
dominance environment stemming from budget deficits and excessive domestic borrowing. In order to 
solve  this  problem,  under  the  current  economic  program,  giant  leaps  have  been  taken  towards 
decreasing  interest  rates  and  achieving  sustainable  borrowing  by  employing  tight  fiscal  policies.  In 
addition,  steps  have  been  taken  towards  eliminating  the  public  debt  sustainability  problem  in  the 
medium  and  long  run  by  achieving  primary  surplus.  At  this  point,  I  would  like  to  underline  that  the 
stability, confidence and positive expectations, which have emerged in the markets as a result of the 
tight fiscal policies, have significantly contributed to the downward trend in inflation.  
Furthermore, continuous increases in productivity, the strong position of the Turkish lira and an income 
policy in line with inflation have to a large extent contributed to the favorable course of inflation in the 
recent period. Domestic demand has been kept under control as a result of the tight and prudent fiscal 
and  monetary  policies.  The  postponed  consumption  and  investments,  accompanied  by  advanced 
consumption, which was driven by worries stemming from old habits, have been instrumental in the 
rapid increase in domestic demand in the first two quarters of 2004. However, the increase in domestic 
demand slowed down evidently as of the second half of 2004, as expected. . Accordingly, the level of 
domestic  demand  did  not  exceed  the  production  capacity,  and  thus  no  demand-side  pressure  was 
created  on  inflation.  These  developments  were  foreseen  by  the  Central  Bank  and,  after  a  brief 
interlude, short-term interest rates began to be reduced again from September 2004.e. No apparent 
pressure of this kind is expected in 2005 either, provided that the tight monetary and fiscal policies 
continue to be implemented and the incomes policy follows a course in line with inflation. However, as 
I  have  just  mentioned,  the  recent  press  release  “March  Inflation  and  Outlook”  needs  to  be  read 
carefully.

Although the period of chronic inflation has been left behind, a period of lasting price stability has not 
yet  been  entered.  As  I  have  occasionally  emphasized  in  my  speeches,  we  are  still  experiencing  a 
period of “disinflation”. Having said that, the distance covered and the gains attained are significant.  
Throughout  this  whole  process,  inflation  dynamics  not  only  changed  as  a  result  of  the  policies 
implemented, but also the effect of disinflation itself. This, in turn, helped inflation to be pushed down 
in an irreversible way.  
Breaking inflation inertia is the first clearly noticeable achievement in terms of the changing dynamics 
of  inflation.  As  I  have  mentioned  before,  due  to  increased  confidence  that  the  fall  in  inflation  is

permanent and the effective communications policy implemented in the last three years, the inflation 
target has become an increasingly reliable anchor for economic units and there have been significant 
breaks in the inflation inertia.  
Another change observed in inflation dynamics is that the decline in inflation also led to reducing its 
volatility. With less volatility in inflation, it can be seen that prices have resumed their signaling role in 
the  economy.  This  development,  which  shows  ease  in  uncertainty,  has  been  instrumental  in  the 
decline of the risk premium and thus the nominal and real interest rates. It has also helped to reduce 
the borrowing cost for consumers and the opportunity cost of investment for producers. In fact, during 
this  period  not  only  real  interest  rates  eased,  but  also  the  general  level  of  interest  rates  and  the 
extension of maturities. During the last three years, ex-ante real interest rates declined more than 20 
points and nominal interest rates more than 50 points. The Turkish Treasury borrowed for the first time 
ever with a 5 year-maturity in the domestic market. Long-term housing credits, known as “mortgages” 
and widespread in developed countries for a long time, will start to be extended for the first time in the 
country’s history. This is the most striking evidence that enough confidence has been established in 
the economy. Uncertainty has eased owing to reduced volatility in inflation and economic units have 
been able to foresee longer maturities, thus that the risk premium has declined.

Another significant point I will mention in relation to the changing dynamics of inflation is the apparent 
change observed in the pricing behavior of producers and consumers. Hand-in-hand with the start of 
the  disinflation  process  and  the  acknowledgement  to  a  large extent  in  economic  units  that  this  is a 
permanent  state,  producers  and  consumers  have  adopted  a  different  approach.  Producers  have 
started to pay more attention to cost control and the increase in productivity, while setting their profit 
margins  in  pricing  policy  and  consumers  have  begun  to  be  more  actively  involved  in  the  pricing 
process by conducting price and quality controls, using the advantage of a more competitive market.

At this point, within the scope of the changing dynamics of inflation, I would like to talk about the pass-
through  effect  of  the  exchange  rates  on  inflation,  which  is  quite  significant  not  only  in  terms  of  the 
determinants of inflation, but also the current exchange rate regime. The pass-through effect has been 
gradually becoming weaker, as a consequence of the transition to the floating exchange rate regime, 
increasing competitiveness, inflation targets increasingly assuming the role of being an anchor owing 
to reliable economic policies, as well as changes in the pricing behavior of producers and consumers. 
Especially in the recent period, the effects of the changes in the exchange rate on inflation were lower 
than expected, and at the same time were weaker and more lagged compared to previous periods.  
As  a  matter  of  fact,  worldwide  examples  also  show  that  in  economies  that  have  achieved  price 
stability, the pass-through effect on prices of exchange rate movements becomes weaker owing to the

prevalence  of  pricing  in  terms  of  the  domestic  currency,  thus  perceiving  any  depreciation  of  the 
national currency as temporary, and companies resort to price adjustments much less frequently.  
In fact, it is inevitable that exchange rate developments will influence prices in Turkey due to the fact 
that the goods basket of the CPI mainly consists of imported goods and imported intermediate goods 
make up a significant portion of input costs. Another contributory factor is that Turkey is a small size-
open  economy  obtaining  goods  at  global  prices.  Yet,  studies  conducted  under  the  umbrella  of  the 
CBRT point to an evident breach regarding the reflection of exchange rate developments on prices 
following  the  2001  Crisis.  The  pass-through  effect  of  the  historically  high  exchange  rates  on  prices 
seems to have weakened especially in case of non-tradable goods.  
On the other hand, compared to the CPI index with the base year 1994, the CPI index with the base 
year 2003 includes more of the commodities groups with prices susceptible to exchange rates, and 
thus causes the effects of exchange rate movements on the general index to be somewhat higher. As 
for the PPI, the start of the release of those prices, excluding taxes, together with the index with the 
base  year  2003  heightened  the  susceptibility  of  this  index  to  exchange  rates.  Having  said  that, 
independent of the nature of the index, when compared with the pre-2001 period, the exchange rate-
inflation relationship is forecasted to have been at lower levels and is concluded to have weakened 
structurally.

Another significant development stimulated by the disinflation process and the environment of relative 
macroeconomic stability was the launch of the operation to drop zeros from the Turkish lira, i.e. the 
eventual launch of the monetary reform in 2005.  
Plans put forward from time to time from the early-1990s, which proposed dropping zeros from the lira 
continually had to be postponed as the structural economic problems could not be solved, nor could 
the rate of inflation or the inflation expectations be brought down to acceptable levels. The chronic and 
high  inflation  experienced  during  this  period  gradually  took  its  toll  on  banknote  denominations  and 
monetary values. As you all know, this process eventually not only led to the Turkish lira having the 
highest denominated banknote numerically all over the world, but also adversely affected someof its 
functions, namely as a medium of exchange and a store of value.  
Following  the  program  under  implementation,  the  distance  covered  in  terms  of  economic  stability 
prepared a suitable environment for monetary reform, and six zeros were dropped from the Turkish lira 
as of 1 January 2005 when the New Turkish Lira was put into circulation.

 BIS Review 36/2005
The  experiences  of  other  countries  that  dropped  zeros  from  their  currencies  differ  in  those  which 
suffered from hyperinflation and those , which had relatively, lower rates of inflation. In the former, it 
can be seen that monetary reforms were generally carried out as part of the stability program, without 
waiting  for  inflation  to  go  down  considerably.  Whereas,  in  the  case  of  the  latter,  reforms  were 
implemented  after  inflation  was  brought  down  sufficiently.  In  other  words,  reforms  were  carried  out 
after a certain distance had been covered in the fight against inflation. Also, in the case of Turkey, 
monetary  reform  was  launched,  not  as  part  of  the  stability  program,  but  after  having  monitored  the 
results of the program and achieved macroeconomic stability to a large extent.  
At this point, I would like to point out that the realization of monetary reform up to now has been mainly 
in tune with our forecasts and has followed a favorable course. As of 8 April 2005, the amount of YTL 
banknotes in the total amount of banknotes made up 73.5 percent.  
Within  this  framework,  it  has  come  to  our  attention  that  some  foreign  financial  enterprises  have 
recently  begun  to  issue  bonds  denominated  in  the  New  Turkish  Lira.  Another  positive  impact  of 
monetary  reform  which  also  strengthens  the  macroeconomic  stability  process  is  that  the  securities 
issued  in  international  markets  in  New  Turkish  Lira  can  now  be  cleared.  Due  to  the  inability  of  the 
technical  facilities  of  foreign  financial  enterprises  to  keep  records  of  a  currency  unit  with  all  those 
zeros,  issues  denominated  in  Turkish  lira  could  not  be  cleared  in  the  international  systems  of  safe 
custody such as Euroclear or Clearstream before the transition to the New Turkish Lira. This obstacle 
has been removed with the dropping of six zeros from the Turkish lira and the introduction of the New 
Turkish Lira.  
After  all,  monetary  reform  is  one  of  the  most  prominent  indicators  of  the  permanence  of 
macroeconomic stability and of the fact that price stability will be attained within this context.  
At this point in my speech, I would like to underline that price stability has not yet been achieved in 
Turkey. As I have just mentioned, significant distance has been covered in the fight against inflation. 
However,  it  is  a  fact  that  inflation  is  still  relatively  high  in  Turkey  compared  to  fellow  developing 
countries. The process of the fight against inflation still continues.  
Within this framework, there are certain factors that need to be paid attention to, for price stability to be 
achieved  in  the  upcoming  period.  The  first  one  of  these  is  ensuring  that  the  increase  in  domestic 
demand continues to materialize in a controlled fashion.  
The second factor I would like to emphasize is avoiding reform fatigue. Several structural reforms have 
been made in the Turkish economy up until now. Yet there are still more reforms pending. . It should 
be remembered that maintaining the reforms made up to this point is not sufficient to attain positive 
outcomes from them, but making new reforms is also equally important.  
The  third  factor  that  requires  attention  within  the  framework  of  achieving  price  stability  is  the 
susceptibility  of  established  economic  balances  to  expectations.  Therefore,  developments  that  may 
adversely affect expectations should not be allowed to occur.  
The  last  factor  that  should  be  taken  into  consideration  in  this  respect  is  the  fact  that  since  policy-
makers, both agricultural, cannot control them and energy prices may at times have adverse effects on 
the course of inflation. Yet, it should be kept in mind that these effects may be temporary and do not 
have an evident impact on the basic trend of inflation.  
After  assessments  on  inflation,  monetary  reform  and  the  risks,  I  would  now  like  to  share  with  you 
certain points I consider significant with respect to growth.  
As you all know, the Turkish economy has been enjoying high rates of growth for three consecutive 
years. The GNP growth rate was realized as 9.9 percent in 2004. Accordingly, the real growth rate 
compared to 2001 was 25.5 percent. A growth rate of 5 percent is forecasted for 2005. Thus, positive 
growth rates will be attained for a period of four years owing to a determined and sustainable stability 
program, as well as the gradual increase in the role of the private sector. Whereas in the past, in an 
environment of high inflation and uncertainty, the Turkish economy displayed a rather unstable growth 
performance.  At  this  point,  I  would  like  to  draw  your  attention  to  the  changing  dynamics  of  growth: 
High growth rates were achieved while inflation was in decline. Now, the growth process is driven by 
productivity increase, the private sector and exports.

Together  with  the  fall  in  interest  rates  in  recent  years  and  the  appreciation  of  the  Turkish  lira,  the 
production of private firms has acquired a capital-intensive nature. Besides, firms resorted to a series 
of measures in the post-crisis period, to remedy the inefficiency of the production process. All these 
developments  led  to  high-rated  increases  in  productivity  in  recent  years.  Productivity  increases  not 
only raised the return on capital, but also encouraged investments.  
The  positive  impact  of  these  favorable  developments  in  productivity  increase  as  well  as  the  high 
growth  performance  of  the  last  three  years  began  to  be  seen  in  employment.  Total  employment 
increased  by  more  than  5  percent  in  the  last  quarter  of  2004  compared  to  the  same  period  the 
previous year. The implemented stability program naturally enabled the share of the private sector to 
increase.  As  a  result  of  this,  the  increase  in  employment  is  recorded  mainly  in  this  sector.  The 
increase in productivity and investments will contribute to sustain growth in the medium term. Hence, 
the increase in employment is also expected to continue in the coming periods.

 BIS Review 36/2005
A reflection of the high rate of growth recorded in 2004 was the increase in the current account deficit, 
as  often  discussed  by  the  public.  It  is  useful  to  point  out  before  anything  else  that  it  is  a  natural 
outcome for economic growth above forecasts to widen the current account deficit. The realization of 
the rate of growth as 9.9 percent in 2004, which had been forecasted as 5 percent, led to a parallel 
increase in the current account deficit above forecasts. However, the rise in the current account deficit 
today should not be interpreted as resulting in crisis as in the past. The world trend also supports this 
assessment: Deepening of commercial and financial integration makes it possible for countries with 
macroeconomic stability to sustain higher current account deficits than before. Within this context, in 
order  to  have  a  clear  understanding of  the  situation  Turkey  is in  today,  we need  to reflect  on what 
happened  in  the  past.  At  this  point,  I  would  first  like  to  give  you  a  brief  overview  of  what  we 
experienced in the past.  
Looking  at  the  past,  we  see  lax  fiscal  policies  and  monetary  policies,  which  had  to  accommodate 
them. The latter was accompanied by pegged or foreseeable exchange rate regimes. The outcome of 
this  scenario  was  high  inflation  and  periods  of  volatile  and  unbalanced  growth.  In  such  an 
environment,  expectations  deteriorated  because  the  public  sector  led  the  excessive  increase  in 
domestic  demand,  maturities  were  shortened  and  uncertainty  increased,  the  current  account  deficit 
widened,  and  measures  continued  to  fell  behind.  With  the  addition  of  the  adverse  trigger-effect  of 
domestic  or  external  factors  to  this  environment,  an  increase  in  foreign  exchange  demand  and 
pressure  on  the  foreign  exchange  reserves  of  CBRT  was  inevitable,  resulting  in  crises  and 
devaluation. However, the present circumstances of the Turkish economy are very different from those 
of the past.  
To start with, as you all know, unlike the past, a floating exchange rate regime is being implemented. 
The most apparent feature of the floating exchange rate regime is that it is shock-absorbent. In other 
words, changes in the demand or supply of foreign exchange are reflected in the level of the exchange 
rate, and in contrast to pegged or foreseeable exchange rate regimes, the exchange rate goes up or 
down. The analysis of a total of 52 balance of payments crises experienced in the 1980-2001 period in 
19 countries including Turkey show that 51 of these crises erupted under managed floating exchange 
rate regimes.1 Thus, in almost all countries facing a balance of payments crisis it can be seen that 
pegged  or  foreseeable  exchange  rate  regimes  were  being  implemented.  In  addition,  there  were 
problems  related  to  financial  stability  or  the  implementation  of  tight  fiscal  and  incomes  policies  that 
were supposed to support the exchange rate regimes in these countries.  
A second issue I would like to touch upon is that the open positions of the banking sector are so low 
that  they  are  even  comparable  to  those  of  the  past.  Within  this  framework,  the  amount  of  open 
positions of the banking sector is closely monitored and necessary warnings are given. Meanwhile, the 
real sector should also be cautious about open positions.  
Another important issue that needs to be kept in mind in relation to the current account deficit is that 
the Central Bank does not try to artificially keep the New Turkish Lira overvalued. US dollar 21.7 billion 
worth of foreign exchange purchase since 2002 is an indicator of this. Besides, short-term capital is 
not encouraged, and market players are continually reminded that the exchange rate risk lies in the 
market. Moreover, the high level of foreign exchange reserves, the relatively low inflation environment 
achieved  through  tight  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  and  the  distance  covered  in  terms  of 
macroeconomic stability are all indications of the changing circumstances.  
Now, I would like to talk to you about a different dimension of the growth process, which I have already 
mentioned.  
Sustainable growth 
We know that the growth process of the Turkish economy was in the form of an expansion-contraction 
cycle, especially for the period until 2001. In the past, generally short periods of economic expansion 
used to be followed by drastic shrinkage. However, the fact that high rates of growth were attained 
three successive years, following the contraction in 2001, and that the rate of growth for this year is

forecasted  to  be  5  percent  show  that  this  cycle  has,  to  a  large  extent,  been  broken.  Yet,  it  is  not 
possible to conclude that the Turkish economy has entered a process of sustainable growth. 
The same as price stability; sustainable growth is a vague notion to the Turkish economy. Sustainable 
growth can be defined as achieving permanent price stability, building consistency between economic 
indicators  and  macroeconomic  balances  and  sustaining  growth  rates  closer  to  the  potential  growth 
level  for  a  period  of  five  years  or  more.  Therefore,  we  still  cannot  define  the  high  growth  rates 
observed in the last three years as sustainable growth. It should not be forgotten that strategies, which 
initiate  growth  and  those,  which  achieve  the  sustainability  of  growth  differ.  .  In  this  framework,  the 
achievement of sustainable growth in our country requires more comprehensive and radical reforms. 
Now,  I  will  explain  the  measures  to  be  taken  by  outlining  the  reasons  for  the  failure  to  achieve 
sustainable growth.  
The  main  reasons  behind  the  failure  in  achieving  sustainable  growth  include  a  large  underground 
economy, the inadequacy of domestic savings and capital accumulation of the private sector, the fact 
that  increases  in  productivity  may  not  be  permanent  due  to  deficiencies  in  institutional  governance, 
problems concerning the quality of labor supply, poor relations between the banking sector and the 
real sector and the inadequate tax system.  
According to predictions made in studies, the extent of the underground economy in Turkey ranges 
from  16  to  50  percent.  As  we  cannot  impose  taxes  on  the  underground  economy,  the  state  takes 
heavy  losses.  Moreover,  the  underground  economy  causes  inefficient  utilization  of  the  country’s 
resources and creates unfair competition. That is why it is of the utmost importance that policies aimed 
at the registration of the underground economy are carried out at once.  
The  domestic  savings  rate  of  our  country  is  very  low  compared  to  that  of  both  developing  and 
developed  countries.  Actually,  what  lies  beneath  this  fact  is  Turkey’s  low-income  level.  It  is  very 
difficult  to  increase  the  income  level  and  change  the  saving  tendency  in  the  short  term.  For  this 
reason, the domestic savings deficit should preferably be met by direct foreign capital investments.

Due  to  the  current  economic  program  and  the  structural  reforms  in  the  scope  of  the  program,  a 
transition  from  a  public  sector-supported  capital  accumulation  model  to  a  private  sector-supported 
accumulation model occurs, where market conditions are taken as indicators and criteria. The share of 
the private sector in the national income increases, whereas the share of the public sector declines. It 
is clear that the private sector-oriented growth plays a major role in achieving sustainable growth by 
boosting  both  exports  and  total  industrial  production.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  private 
sector could not meet the expectations because it could not exploit sufficient resources. This was due 
to the dominance of the public sector borrowing requirement in the finance sector. Furthermore, the 
factors  that  slow  down  the  capital  accumulation  process  include  the  incomplete  tax  reform  and  the

poor  relationship  between  banking  sector  and  real  sector.  I  will  explain  tax  and  banking  reforms  in 
more detail in the forthcoming parts of my speech. 
Improving economic productivity is fundamental for achieving price stability and concurrent sustainable 
growth  in  the  long  run,  that  is  to  say  an  increase  in  real  income  and  welfare.  A  rise  in  total  factor 
productivity is expected to be one of the core dynamics of sustainable growth to be attained in the next 
10 years in Turkey. The manufacturing industry has recently witnessed a boost in productivity. The 
critical  point  here  is  that  increases  in  productivity  should  be  reflected  on  all  sectors  and  become 
sustainable.  Therefore,  it  is  very  important  that  labor  education  and  institutional  governance  is 
improved through research and development of technology, which will provide a constant increase in 
total factor productivity.

Sustainable increase in employment  
In Turkey, sustainable growth depends on the increases in productivity and capital stock as well as on 
the  enhancement  of  labor  supply  and  labor  quality.  For  this  reason,  determination  of  the  structural 
obstacles standing in the way of employment and the establishment of policies aimed at their removal 
bear much significance.  
Employment differs according to the responses of a country’s labor market, the financial structure of its 
firms and its institutional structure in the changing economic conditions. This diversity causes different 
rates  of  natural  unemployment  in  countries  with  the  same  potential  growth  rates.  Sustainable 
employment  requires  sustainable  growth  along  with  the  adaptation  of  an  institutional  structure  and 
labor market to match international standards of competition.  
In Turkey, there has been an increase in the labor flow from the agriculture sector to the industrial and 
services  sectors.  Hence,  the  solution  to  the  employment  problem  is  becoming  more  complex 
considering  the  amount  of  growth  in  Turkey,  which  leads  to  a  failure  to  create  employment  in  the 
medium term. Migration from village to city raises the unemployed and unskilled labor supply in the 
industrial  and  services  sectors.  Meanwhile,  the  current  production  processes  in  our  country  are 
insufficient to switch to high value added products, which can compete in the international market. The 
high rate of unemployed skilled labor in Turkey underlines the need for a production process, which 
focuses on high value added products. In line with this aim, strategic plans should be made in order to 
mobilize  investor  potential,  carry  out  labor  planning  and  conduct  labor  education  in  chosen  sectors 
within the framework of an encouragement model. Feasible finance and marketing techniques should 
be  adopted  in  order  to  achieve  effectiveness  in  these  strategic  plans  and  encouragement 
mechanisms.  
BIS Review 36/2005 
 13
The  implementation  of  employment-oriented  finance  models  and  labor  education  will  contribute  to 
providing  a  solution  to  the  employment  problem  by  establishing  stronger  relations  between  the 
agriculture  sector  and  the  industrial  and  services  sector.  Other  factors  that  will  help  to  increase 
employment include establishing control of the underground economy by lowering employment taxes 
in  the  scope  of  reducing  labor  costs,  sustaining  increases  in  productivity,  devising  long-term  plans 
compatible with the labor supply aimed at increasing skilled labor and formulating policies consistent 
with the European Employment Strategy.  
Now, I would like to touch upon another topic, real interest rates and the problem of public debt.  
The  continuity  of  structural  reforms,  a  stronger  macroeconomic  balance  and  the  confidence  of 
economic agents will surely contribute to a further decline in real interest rates in Turkey. Another main 
indicator of the relation between structural reforms and the level of real interests is the credit levels in 
the country and the inverse relationship between risk premium and real interest rates. As it is known, 
the  credit  rating  of  a  country  is  assessed  according  to  its  economic  principles  and  macroeconomic 
structure. The analyses indicate that real interest rates display a downward trend in economies with 
high credit ratings, while they maintain an upward trend in economies with low credit ratings. In other 
words, real interest rates are low in structurally sound economies, whereas they are high in structurally 
deficient  economies.  Therefore,  it  is  obvious  that  structural  reforms  should  be  implemented 
immediately in order to bring real interest rates down.  
Another point I’d like to mention about achieving lower real interest rates is that this anticipated decline 
cannot  be  realized  without  considering  short-term  interest  rates and  the  inflation  outlook, which  are 
CBRT’s  policy  instruments.  For  instance,  real  interest  rates  cannot  be  artificially  reduced  without 
observing the current and future trend of the rise in domestic demand. As I have mentioned earlier, 
economic  expectations  and  the  confidence  in  the  authorities  and  policies,  which  are  implemented 
within this framework, will contribute the most to the achievements made in macroeconomic stability.  
In this framework, as the Central Bank has mentioned repeatedly, the future trend of inflation as well 
as the inflation target is considered while making decisions on short-term interest rates. The Central 
Bank also uses a wide set of information to analyze this trend. Therefore, if the Central Bank uses a 
variable other than the future trend of inflation in its decisions concerning interest rates, it may send 
the wrong signals to economic agents, reduce confidence and, contrary to a targeted decline; this may 
lead to a rise in real interest rates.  
Despite the important achievements made in the economy, the main factors that limit the decline in 
real interests are the high debt stock and unfavorable dynamics of public debt.  
According to empirical studies, there is a direct relation between the ratio of debt stock to the national 
income and the realized real interest rate. Real interests display an upward trend in countries with high 
public debt stock, whereas they are low in countries with modest public debt stock. High public debt 
stock and concerns about the sustainability of public finance cause a direct rise in risk premiums and 
this leads to high real interests rates.  
Although tough measures had been implemented several times prior to the 2001 crisis, strict discipline 
could not be established in public finance and the public deficit was mostly met by borrowing. Hence, 
along with the operations conducted in the banking sector after the 2001 crisis, the ratio of net public 
debt  stock  to  national  income  recorded  its  highest  level  of  91  percent  in  2001.  In  fact,  many 
developing  or  developed  countries  can  attain  this  ratio  in  the  long  run.  However,  until  recently, 
sustainability  of  public  debt  had  been  a  considerable  problem  on  Turkey’s  agenda.  This  problem 
derived from the size of short-term debts, high real interest rates and doubts about policies that were 
being implemented at the time.  
We targeted a high primary surplus comprising the 6.5 percent of the national income and reached our 
goals in the framework of the stability program, which has been implemented for the last three years. 
The  same  target  has  been  set  for  the  year  2005,  as  well.  Thus,  the  commitment  to  continue  the 
programme of tight fiscal policy has been strengthened. As a result of these achievements, significant 
developments were made in public debt dynamics in the last three years. The ratio of net public debt 
stock to national income declined to 64.5 percent end-2004 and the Treasury borrowed with a five-
year maturity for the first time in the domestic market. Sustainability of debt will soon be taken off the 
agenda soon. 
In this framework, it will be possible for the risk premium and consequently real interest rates to go 
further down in the upcoming period, as public finance has been equipped with a sustainable structure

Now,  I  would  like  to  underline  a  specific  point  related  to  the  current  tight  fiscal  policy.  As  I  have 
mentioned  earlier,  tight  fiscal  policy  played  an  important  role  not  only  in  alleviating  the  public  debt 
problem, but also in the improvement of expectations. The key factor regarding the tight fiscal policy in 
the said period was the target of a high primary surplus.  
Until recently, heated discussions have been held about this matter and various views have been put 
forward both on the implementation of a tight fiscal policy and setting the primary surplus as the target, 
as well as its level. Some people even suggested that a tight fiscal policy could hamper growth. For 
this reason, let me briefly remind you of the effects of tight fiscal policy and, within this context, of the 
primary surplus target of the economy.  
As  it  is  known,  in  countries  like  Turkey  with  a  high  ratio  of  public  debt  to  national  income,  which 
possessed  lax  fiscal  discipline  in  the  past,  expectations  towards  the  ability  of  debt  roll-over  are  the 
main determinants of economic developments, especially the dynamics of inflation and growth.  
For this reason, the main target of our fiscal policies has been to reduce the ratio of public debt stock 
to  national  income  gradually  and  to  equip  public  finance  with  a  sustainable  structure.  Lowering  the 
ratio of public debt stock to national income depends on mathematically higher growth rates, lower real 
interest rates, the stable course of the national currency and the primary budget surplus due to the 
effect  of  foreign  currency  borrowing  on  the  debt  stock.  Primary  surplus  is  the  only  one  of  these 
variables, which can be controlled by authorities under the current economic conditions. That is why, 
the  primary  surplus  is  the  targeted  variable  and  we  set  our  goals  high  in  order  to  increase  the 
credibility of the policies, which aim to reduce the ratio of public debt to national income.  
The high primary surplus target convinces economic units of the possibility of debt rollover as well as 
reducing public debt, improving expectations and generating confidence. Positive expectations lead to 
a decline in the risk premium and, as a result, real interest rates and contribute to the stability of the 
New Turkish Lira. This process is likely to directly affect growth. The most convincing proof of this is 
the implementation of tight fiscal policy in Turkey for the last three years and the realization of record 
high growth rates.  
Now  let  me  touch  upon  a  subject  that  I  frequently  come  across  in  the  print  media  and  peoples’ 
comments,  which  shows  there  are  mixed  opinions  on  macroeconomic  policies.  In  the  scope  of  the 
entire Turkish economy and the definition of various economic variables such as growth, employment, 
inflation, debt stock, foreign trade statistics and current account balance, a fact determined not only 
technically,  but  also  in  practice,  is  that  macroeconomic  policies  cannot  affect  all  these  variables 
BIS Review 36/2005 
 15
directly  and  at  the  same  time.  Therefore,  setting  a  figure  for  each  economic  variable  and  defining 
these  as  targets  is  not  correct  practice  within  the  framework  of  the  market  economy.  In  market 
economies, the aggregates that can be controlled by authorities are set as targets while designing the 
policies. In our country, under the current economic conditions, these aggregates include consumer 
price inflation and the ratio of primary surplus to national income. Other variables, such as the growth 
rate, real interest rates, and producer price inflation are the outcomes in this sense and can only be 
forecasted. That is why I believe that the difference between the concepts of macroeconomic targets 
and forecasts should be taken into account in the opinions expressed.  
Direct foreign capital investments and competition  
As I have mentioned earlier, in order to achieve high rates of sustainable growth, the domestic savings 
gap  should  be  offset  by  external  resource  inflow,  namely,  direct  foreign  capital  investments. 
Historically  speaking,  it  is  clear  that  Turkey  has  displayed  poor  performance  in  attracting  direct 
investments despite its large domestic market, proximity to developing-strategic markets owing to its 
geographical position, developed infrastructure and young population. As a matter of fact, net direct 
foreign  capital  investments  to  Turkey  in  the  1995-2000  period  amounted  to  US  dollar  1  billion  on 
average. This corresponds to only 4 per thousand / 4 %0 of Turkey’s GDP. The developments of the 
following years do not point to a lasting improvement in Turkey’s performance in this sense either. In 
Turkey, the ratio of direct foreign capital stocks to the GDP had not changed since 1990 and still stood 
at 9 percent as of end-2003, while this ratio rose as high as 50 percent for the Czech Republic and 
Hungary and 30 percent for Argentina and Brazil during the same period.

When the conditions for foreign direct investment are analyzed from the perspective of international 
investors,  two  factors  come  to  the  forefront  as  prerequisites:  The  first  one  is  related  an  investment 
environment  with  a  healthy  functioning  legal  system  with  legal  security.  The  latter  includes  the 
attainment  of  sustainable  macroeconomic  balances  and  administrative  stability  in  basic  policies  on 
international  investments  achieved  irrespectively  of  changing  governments.  In  other  words,  what  is 
essential is the stability of the policies that are being implemented. Turkey’s experiences show that 
partial improvements that are achieved without meeting these two prerequisites will not help to attract 
direct foreign investments to the country. Furthermore, other problems that should be noted include 
the unpredictability of legal arrangements, the amount of time wasted on administrative regulations, as 
well as the lack of transparency and consistency.  
Studies aimed at removing these unfavorable conditions and attracting more direct investment have 
gained  momentum  in  Turkey  since  2000,  followed  by  the  enactment  of  a  new  Direct  Foreign 
Investment  Law.  In  this  framework,  the  conditions  for  establishing  companies  were  eased  and  the

establishment  process  was  shortened  to  24  hours,  while  the  number  of  official  authorities  to  be 
referred  to  for  the  establishment  procedures  was  reduced  to  2  from  19  and  the  number  of  official 
documents to 8 from 56. Another positive development regarding foreign investments was the meeting 
of the Investment Advisory Council for Turkey in March 2004. This meeting gave foreign directors the 
chance to directly convey their evaluations about Turkey to top-level authorities. Meanwhile, Turkey 
had  the  opportunity  to  show  her  enthusiasm  for  foreign  investments.  However,  despite  all  these 
favorable  developments,  no  improvement  was  noted  pertaining  to  problems  regarding  sectoral 
licenses,  land  acquisition  and  site  development,  taxes  and  incentives  regulation,  customs  and 
standards, and intellectual property rights.  
At  this  point,  I  should  underline  the  fact  that  investment  problems  encountered  by  Turkish 
entrepreneurs  and  foreign  entrepreneurs  in  Turkey  do  not  differ  that  much.  “Complexity  of  the 
administrative  and  bureaucratic  process”  stands  as  one  of  the  most  important  barriers  to  both 
domestic and foreign capital investments. To ensure long-term development in Turkey, the investment 
environment  needs  to  be  improved.  This,  in  turn,  depends  on  an  efficient  legal  system  as  well  as 
sustainable  macroeconomic  balances  and  administrative  stability  in  terms  of  basic  policies.  In  this 
framework,  policies  regarding  foreign  trade,  competitiveness  and  education-technology  should  be 
implemented in coordination and conformity.  
the 
immediate  sound  policies  and 
Conditions for continued success 
So far, I have tried to explain the relative macroeconomic stability and the structural transformation 
process observed in the Turkish economy in the last three years. I wanted to draw your attention to the 
radical  changes  experienced  throughout  this  process.  These  radical  changes  have  created  an 
environment in which uncertainties and resulting volatilities have been eased. In this environment, it is 
now possible to make forward-looking policy suggestions that will enable the improvement of social 
welfare  and  necessary  measures  to  be  taken.  However,  despite  the  significant  distance  covered  in 
terms of achieving lasting macroeconomic stability, we have not yet reached desired level. In order to 
make  current  achievements  permanent, 
the  structural 
transformation process should continue in an uninterrupted manner.  
As also stated in the 2004 European Union Progress Report on Turkey, structural reforms needed for 
establishing a healthy macroeconomic environment in the coming period can be categorized under a 
number of headings.  
The  first  one  is  the  necessity  of  assuring  ongoing  support  to  the  achieved  stability  in  the  banking 
sector with the help of reforms that will strengthen the sector. Despite the important steps taken on the 
way to remove problems in the banking systems following the 2001 crisis, there are still shortcomings 
in this area. In line with the achievements observed in the banking sector, studies for an effective risk 
management scheme have started. However, banks have not yet been able to fulfill their intermediary 
functions  as  effectively  as  expected.  This  results  mainly  from  the  fact  that  the  banks  are  still  the 
principal fund-raisers to finance public deficits. Reducing the ratio of public deficits and debt stock to 
national  income  will  increase  disposable  resources  and  this  will  remove  the  obstacles  to  credits 
extended to the real sector by the banking sector. The implementation of modern risk management in 
credit facilities will equip banks and companies with a more robust financial structure. Needless to say, 
all these developments mean that the banking sector supports the capital accumulation process in the 
private sector by providing the real sector with resources. This, in turn, shows that the current program 
is providing critical support for the real sector through banking reform.  
The  second  issue  is  tax  reform.  Although  important  steps  have  been  taken  regarding  tax  reform  in 
Turkey in the last few years, our tax system still has some flaws in matters of equality, effectiveness 
and management. In order to remove the unfavorable effects of the tax system on the economy and to 
assure permanent increases in income, the tax system should be simplified and the effectiveness of 
tax  administration  should  be  increased.  The  tax  system  should  be  equipped  with  a  simple, 
comprehensible and fair structure that will avoid discrimination between different sectors.  
Studies  to  broaden  the  tax  base,  formalize  the  informal  economy  and  restructure  income 
management,  which  are  among  the  reforms  envisioned  in  the  current  program,  have  not  been 
completed yet. The finalization and immediate implementation of these reforms will make an important 
contribution  to  the  sustainability  of  fiscal  adjustment.  In  this  context,  tax  reform  will  also  provide 
extensive  support  for  the  stabilization  program  by  allowing  the  fair  allocation  of  costs  in  society. 
BIS Review 36/2005 
 17
Amendments  to  the  tax  system  will  play  a  critical  role  in  reducing  high  labor  costs,  controlling  the 
informal economy and also increasing direct foreign investments.  
In addition, the outcome of reducing the deficiencies in the social security system through reforms will 
be felt in the long-term. In addition, studies for reducing the role of the public sector in the economy, 
putting good governance principles into effect and further improving the investment environment are 
on the agenda for the upcoming period.  
It is clear that the establishment of a permanently stable environment and sustainable growth mainly 
depends  on  the  continuation  of  fiscal  discipline.  The  primary  surplus  recorded  under  the  current 
program has greatly served to this end. The success in attaining the primary surplus target in recent 
years  has  played  an  important  role  in  pushing  down  inflation  expectations  and  interest  rates  by 
establishing confidence in the markets. Maintaining the primary surplus target in the upcoming period 
also will only be possible if the quality of fiscal adjustment is increased. Quality of fiscal adjustment 
refers to the question regarding whether fiscal policies are implemented in the framework of a set of 
options that boost growth and wealth. Sustainable fiscal adjustment in the medium and long-term will 
depend  on  the  enactment  of  structural  reforms  in  the  public  sector  rather  than  on  provisional 
measures.  Besides  jeopardizing  the  attainability  of  budget  targets,  a  delay  in  structural  reforms  will 
also cause the supposedly provisional measures to become permanent. Such implementation might 
affect  the  quality  of  expenditures  and  revenues  unfavorably  and  cause  inflationary  impacts  due  to 
revenue-boosting methods. Therefore, increased control and effectiveness in public expenditures are 
critical  factors  for  the  quality  of  fiscal  adjustment.  A  study  comparing  the  fiscal  adjustment  policies 
implemented at different times in OECD countries2 revealed that a long-term improvement in public 
balance can be achieved through expenditure-curbing policies rather than revenue-boosting policies.  
Besides controlling public expenditures, incomes policy also plays an important role in increasing the 
quality of fiscal adjustment. For this reason, the implementation of incomes policy must be coherent 
with the inflation target.  
As I have mentioned before, important policies are pending in the upcoming period in the framework of 
the  European  Employment  Strategy.  These  policies  are  aimed  at  ensuring  that  high  growth 
performance affects employment in such a way to assure a sustainable increase in employment, to 
increase  the  additions  to  the  labor  force  and  to  establish  a  more  flexible  labor  market.  Developing 
coordination  in  economic  policies  and  a  harmonization  of  the  decision-making  process  is  another 
outstanding factor. All these factors will not only establish macroeconomic stability and increase social 
welfare in Turkey, but also play a key role in the European Union integration process.  
Exchange rate regime 
Now I would like to focus on the floating exchange rate regime. As you know, Turkey made the sudden 
decision to adopt the floating exchange rate regime following the crisis in February 2001. This regime 
was  adopted  because  the  predictable  exchange  rate  regime  collapsed  due  to  exogenous  factors 
resulting  from  a  loss  of confidence  in  the  economic  policies  of that  period and  it was  impossible  to 
establish  the  same  confidence  immediately  after.  In  fact,  the  adoption  of  a  floating  exchange  rate 
regime was already included in the economic program of the pre-crisis period.  
The current regime has been implemented successfully for four years. In the early stages, economic 
agents  experienced  adaptation  problems  arising  from  the  unprecedented  nature  of  this  regime; 
however,  these  problems  have  been  overcome  to  a  great  extent.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  floating 
exchange rate regime is successfully implemented in over 80 countries today.  
As we have always emphasized, under the current floating exchange rate regime, the Central Bank 
does not set a specific exchange rate target. Indeed, the exchange rate is determined by supply and 
demand  conditions  in  the  market.  These  conditions  are  shaped  by  developments  in  the  economic 
program as well as the public debt stock, risk premium, expectations, foreign developments and the 
behavior  of  market  players  in  the  short-term;  while  the  determining  factors  in  the  long-term  can  be 
listed as structural reforms and their effects on productivity, net external debt position of the country,

cyclical  movements  in  the  economy  and  economic  fundamentals  such  as  inflation  and  growth.  To 
recap, the exchange rate level is not a cause, but an outcome in the floating exchange rate regime.  
In this framework, the Central Bank operates in the foreign exchange market in two ways. Firstly, it 
holds foreign exchange buying auctions in order to carry out reserve accumulation. The external debt 
payment  schedule  of  the  public  sector  and  plans  for  the  liquidation  of  Foreign  Exchange  Deposit 
Accounts with Credit Letters in the long-term also increase the importance of the level of the Bank’s 
foreign exchange reserves under the floating exchange rate regime. Therefore, the Bank holds foreign 
exchange buying auctions in order to increase the reserves at their disposal at times when the foreign 
exchange  supply  gradually  increases  above  foreign  exchange  demand  due  to  the  rise  in  reverse 
currency  substitution  tendency  and  capital  inflow.  In  the  following  periods,  a  reverse  dollarization 
process will take shape and capital inflow will increase due to the favorable developments regarding 
European  Union  membership  negotiations  in  addition  to  the  completion  of  studies  about  the  new 
three-year  program  concerning  the  continuance  of  fiscal  and  monetary  discipline  and  structural 
reforms. Taking into account these predictions and the fact that a strong reserve position will boost 
confidence  in  the  current  program,  the  Central  Bank  has  resumed  the  foreign  exchange  buying 
auctions  that  were  suspended  on  April  27,  2004  starting  from  December  22,  2004.  Unlike previous 
periods, a yearly program of auctions has been announced in order to minimize the effects of foreign 
exchange buying auctions on the foreign exchange market and exchange rates. In this way, it will be 
possible to minimize the effects on foreign exchange supply and demand conditions and stick to the 
main principles of the floating exchange rate regime. 
Secondly,  the  Central  Bank  may  intervene  in  the  foreign  exchange  market  directly  in  the  event  of 
excessive volatility in exchange rates in either direction that could threaten the price stability target. 
The Bank analyzes the reasons of the volatility in the foreign exchange market thoroughly in daily and 
periodical  terms  and  takes  the  intervention  decision  by  taking  into  account  the  likelihood  of  future 
volatility by considering past data. In the upcoming period, economic agents will probably continue to 
hold domestic currency as a result of further achievements in economic stability, and capital inflow will 
increase. Foreign exchange buying auctions to control volatility might continue in the event of actual or 
likely excessive volatility in the foreign exchange market induced by the above-mentioned conditions.  
I  would  like  to  draw  your  attention  to  another  point  about  the  floating  exchange  rate  regime.  The 
exchange rate is determined in the market under supply and demand conditions, which may turn the 
exchange rate into a risk factor. Undoubtedly, the exchange rate should be accepted as a cost factor 
and closely monitored by decision-making bodies in open economies. In this framework, foreign trade 
firms and other agents, which hold short foreign exchange positions, may face significant risks as a 
result of exchange rate movements.  
However, it should be noted that the volatility in exchange rate is a risk, not an uncertainty. So, it can 
be managed and avoided. 
There  are  two  points  which  should  be  clearly  understood  by  those  who  advocate  the  view  that  a 
floating exchange rate regime harbors high exchange rate risk and can lead to excessive volatility in 
foreign exchange markets, bringing about negative outcomes in the economy – particularly in foreign 
trade. First of all, insofar as capital movements are free, exchange rate risk may also emerge under 
fixed  and  predictable  exchange  rate  regimes.  However,  either  public  banks  or,  as  the  authority  in 
currency matters, central banks, take on the exchange rate risk in these regimes, whereas in a floating 
exchange rate regime, it is taken on by individual economic agents. Secondly, due to the development 
of the derivatives markets, the foreign trade level in a floating exchange rate regime will be the same 
as  the  level  in  a  fixed  exchange  rate  regime.  Hence,  exchange  rate  risk  will  not  affect  the  level  of 
foreign trade3. 
Turkish derivatives exchange (Turkdex)  
In  this  framework,  the effective  operation  of  derivatives  markets is  for enabling  economic agents  to 
hedge  their  balance  sheets  from  exchange  rate  risks  under  the  floating  exchange  rate  regime. 
Macroeconomic stability and the structural transformation process have provided our economy with a

sound environment for risk management. And, the establishment of the Turkish Derivatives Exchange 
has been an important step taken on the way.  
It would be useful to reiterate the potential favorable effects of derivatives markets on our economy.  
First of all, derivatives markets offer economic agents the facility of risk management and make their 
future  revenue  flows  predictable.  Moreover,  expectations  can  be  measured  and  reflected  on  prices 
through these markets. This, in turn, increases the predictability and efficiency of spot markets. In this 
way,  market  prices  provide  economic  agents  with  accurate  information  and  excessive  volatility 
decreases. 
Analyzed  in  terms  of  their  impact  on  the  real  economy,  the  use  of  derivatives  markets  increases 
resistance  to  shocks  in  the  economy  as  a  whole  as  it  reduces  weaknesses  resulting  from  the 
imbalance on firms’ balance sheets. These are created by the fact that the assets and liabilities sides 
denote different currency units or consist of securities with different interest rates. As a matter of fact, 
firms with reduced financial risks on their balance sheets can allocate more resources to production.  
Moreover,  derivatives  markets  introduce  new  investment  instruments  and  encourage  growth  in  the 
financial system. In this way, they increase the number of instruments investors can use to diversify 
their portfolios, and widen the financial markets.  
As  a  result,  derivatives  markets  contribute  to  the  increase  in  national  income  and  employment  by 
ensuring more effective allocation of resources and they provide added value as a separate sector. At 
the same time, these markets enable the real and financial sector investors to manage diverse risks 
parallel to those in world markets as well as allowing integration with those markets.  
Analyzed  in  terms  of  monetary  policy,  derivatives  markets,  whose  development  has  always  been 
backed  by  the  Central  Bank,  support  the  continuity  of  financial  stability  by  reducing  volatility  in  the 
markets and help central banks to maintain financial stability. In addition, they enhance the information 
set used in monetary policy by providing information about the future, and increase the effectiveness 
of the transmission mechanism used to steer the economy. As a consequence, an improved flow of 
information  about  the  future  course  of  monetary  policy  makes  the  economy  more  predictable  for 
economic agents.  
In this framework, the Turkish Derivatives Exchange will make important and diverse contributions to 
the  economy,  especially  in  terms  of  monetary  policy.  Transactions  on  the  Turkish  Derivatives 
Exchange  are  expected  provide  more  forward-looking  and  quantitative  information  for  Central  Bank 
reports, especially with the transition to explicit inflation targeting after 2006. 
Hence,  if  we  bear  in  mind  that  derivatives  markets  act  as  a  “catalyst”  in  the  economy,  all  kinds  of 
arrangements concerning the operation of these markets should be handled carefully. In this context, 
orientation programs and training should be conducted in order to encourage banks and companies to 
operate in this market. 
Central bank independence  
In conclusion, I would like to say a few words about the maintenance and reinforcement of Central 
Bank independence. In addition to the points I will deal with here, you can also refer to the speech 
“Central  Bank  Independence”  on  our  website,  in  which  this  issue  is  covered  in  detail  from  both 
economic and legal perspectives. 
In  democratic  societies,  the  term  ‘independence’  is  used  to  define  the  institutions  establishing  that 
society, for instance, the independent central bank. This issue occasionally raises questions such as 
‘Independence from what or whom?’ However, when looking at the historical background, it can be 
seen that “independence” was granted to institutions by the societies themselves as the consequence 
of  a  democratic  process  and  their  ultimate  goal  is  to  maximize  social  welfare.  Central  Bank 
independence  becomes  even  more  significant,  not  only  as  a  concept,  but  in  terms  of  its 
consequences.  Therefore,  in  order  to  make  sure  that  central  bank  independence  is  understood, 
internalized and safeguarded by the public, it is necessary for them to fully comprehend the rationale 
of  independence,  understand  why  it  is  important  and  become  convinced  that  central  bank 
independence does not imply independence from society. For this reason, I firmly believe that it is vital 
to talk about independence frequently.

As I have reiterated before, it is a globally accepted phenomenon that achieving price stability is the 
prerequisite  of  establishing  a  sound  market  economy  and  attaining  sustainable  growth  and 
employment rates in the long run. 
Another  globally  accepted  phenomenon  is  that  price  stability  can  only  be  achieved  by  employing 
lasting, sound and stable policies. 
For  this reason,  the public  provides  central  banks with  freedom  from political  authorities  in  order  to 
enable them to implement the necessary long-term targets to control inflation and attain price stability, 
to achieve full employment and to sustain growth. This structure gives central banks the opportunity to 
reject  the  implementation  of  policies  that  pose  risks  to  attaining  price  stability  and  creates  an 
environment in which they can give warnings when required. These are the reasons why central bank 
independence is essential.  
Monetary policy implemented by a central bank that is able to effectively exercise its independence, is 
accepted  by  all  sections  of  the  public  and  the  political  authority.  The  implementation  of  policies  by 
institutions  with  clearly  defined  goals  protected  from  short-term  effects  and  able  to  communicate 
regularly,  is  crucial  to  creating  the  required  confidence  for  economic  units  in  their  decision-making 
process. 
Central  bank  independence  is  a  concept  that  can  be  defined  in  various  ways.  The  main  pillar  of 
independence is not to allow a borrowing-lending relationship with the public sector. There are three 
more pillars of independence. The first is goal independence that means the ability to freely determine 
monetary policy targets. Second is target independence, which means the ability to determine targets 
at its own discretion when price stability is set as the goal. Finally, the third pillar is the power to freely 
choose and use monetary policy instruments with the aim of achieving the targets. 
It is again a widely accepted fact that the ability of the central bank to announce its opinion about the 
general  course  of  economy  and  the  risks  using  communication technologies is  part  of  central  bank 
independence. This means warning politicians, non-governmental organizations, financial circles, the 
real sector, in short all sections of the public.  
After  thirty  years  of  chronic  inflation  and  successive  economic  crises,  the  Central  Bank  of  Turkey 
finally obtained independence in 2001, which was quite close to world standards. 
As I have mentioned before, with an amendment made to the Central Bank Law in 2001, the primary 
objective of the Bank was set as achieving price stability and the Bank was granted the direct authority 
to draw up monetary policy and choose monetary policy instruments at its own discretion in order to 
achieve price stability. 
Achieving central bank independence is in fact a very important structural reform in the economy, but 
unfortunately  merely  passing  the  law  is  not  enough  in  itself  for  its  success.  Therefore,  the  real 
challenge  is  to  make  sure  that  every  section  of  the  public  is  aware  of  the  rationale  behind 
independence and to create a common understanding of these reforms before their success can be 
realized.  
Although we have observed significant progress pertaining to independence, we are aware of the fact 
that there is still a long way to go and we know that there will always be room for improvement. . 
The criteria set by the European Central Banking System regarding central bank independence will be 
provide significant guidelines in this field. 
Another important point I would like to mention is that the more independent central banks are, the 
more transparent they become. Central banks share more information with the public about the design 
and implementation of policies and they attach great importance to having an efficient communication 
policy. 
Now let me draw your attention to central bank accountability and further consider the transparency 
issue.  The  provision  of  independence  obliges  central  banks  to  explain  themselves  to  the  public.  In 
other words, for a central bank, being independent means being more transparent in the eyes of the 
public. This is the other side of the coin and is called “accountability”. 
Accountability is an asset that makes the central bank answerable to all sections of the public for the 
policies it implements and their consequences.

This responsibility can only be fulfilled  by central banks when transparency is completely achieved. 
Therefore, in time, central bank independence brought with it increased accountability, transparency 
and the employment of more efficient communication policies. 
Generally,  central  banks  exercise  transparency  by  sharing  their  knowledge  and  opinions  with  the 
public about their final goals, current and future policies and the general outlook of the economy using 
various communication tools. 
Within  this  framework,  the  most  significant  contribution  increased  transparency  and  effective 
communication  could  make  to  the  economy  and  monetary  policy  is  the  reduction  of  uncertainty. 
Furthermore,  a  more  transparent  central  bank  that  attaches  more  importance  to  communication 
policies  helps  economic  units  shape  their  expectations  in  line  with  central  bank  targets  as  the 
predictability of monetary policy is increased. 
As  is  very  well  known,  the  Central  Bank  has  been  pursuing  an  “implicit  inflation  targeting  strategy” 
since 2002. In our announcement regarding the monetary and exchange rate policy for 2002, it was 
announced that explicit inflation targeting strategy would be adopted when the necessary conditions 
were in place. Today, we see that much has been achieved in creating the necessary conditions for 
the transition to explicit inflation targeting. Therefore, in our press release of “Monetary and Exchange 
Rate Policy for 2005” dated December 20, 2004, it was announced that 2005 would be a transition 
period and an explicit inflation targeting strategy would be adopted in 2006. Before concluding, I would 
like to remind you that detailed information about our policies to be implemented in 2005 is available 
on  our  website  in  our  press  release  “Monetary  and  Exchange  Rate  Policy  in  2005”.  You  can  also 
obtain a hardcopy of this announcement as an annex to my speech.  
Thank you for your patience and attention.
