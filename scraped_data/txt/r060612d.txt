 Introduction 
I.  
Since the initiation of reforms in the early 1990s, the Indian economy has achieved high growth in an 
environment of macroeconomic and financial stability. The period has been marked by broad based 
economic  reform  that  has  touched  every  segment  of  the  economy.  These  reforms  were  designed 
essentially to promote greater efficiency in the economy through promotion of greater competition. The 
story of Indian reforms is by now well-documented (e.g., Ahluwalia, 2002); nevertheless, what is less 
appreciated  is  that  India  achieved  this  acceleration  in  growth  while  maintaining  price  and  financial 
stability. As a result of the growing openness, India was not insulated from exogenous shocks since 
the second half of the 1990s. These shocks, global as well as domestic, included a series of financial 
crises in Asia, Brazil and Russia, 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, border tensions, sanctions imposed 
in the aftermath of nuclear tests, political uncertainties, changes in the Government, and the current oil 
shock.  Nonetheless,  stability  could  be  maintained  in  financial  markets.  Indeed,  inflation  has  been 
contained  since  the  mid-1990s  to  an  average  of  around  five  per  cent,  distinctly  lower  than  that  of 
around eight per cent per annum over the previous four decades. Simultaneously, the health of the 
financial sector has recorded very significant improvement.  
India's path of reforms has been different from most other emerging market economies: it has been a 
measured, gradual, cautious, and steady process, devoid of many flourishes that could be observed in 
other  countries.  I  shall  argue  in  this  paper  that  reforms  in  the  financial  sector  and  monetary  policy 
framework  have  been  a  key  component  of  the  overall  reforms  that  provided  the  foundation  of  an 
increased price and financial stability. Reforms in these sectors have been well-sequenced, taking into 
account the state of the markets in the various segments.  
The main objective of the financial sector reforms in India initiated in the early 1990s was to create an 
efficient,  competitive  and  stable  financial  sector  that  could  then  contribute  in  greater  measure  to 
stimulate  growth.  Concomitantly,  the  monetary  policy  framework  made  a  phased  shift  from  direct 
instruments of monetary management to an increasing reliance on indirect instruments. However, as 
appropriate monetary transmission cannot take place without efficient price discovery of interest rates 
and exchange rates in the overall functioning of financial markets, the corresponding development of 
the  money  market,  Government  securities  market  and  the  foreign  exchange  market  became 
necessary.  Reforms  in  the  various  segments,  therefore,  had  to  be  coordinated.  In  this  process, 
growing integration of the Indian economy with the rest of the world also had to be recognised and 
provided for.  
Against this backdrop, the coverage of this paper is threefold. First, I will give a synoptic account of the 
reforms in financial sector and monetary policy. Second, this is followed by an assessment of these 
reforms in terms of outcomes and the health of the financial sector. Finally, lessons emerging from the 
Indian experience for issues of topical relevance for monetary authorities are considered in the final 
Section.

Financial sector and monetary policy: objectives and reforms 
II.  
Till the early 1990s the Indian financial sector could be described as a classic example of “financial 
repression”  a  la  McKinnon  and  Shaw.  Monetary  policy  was  subservient  to  the  fisc.  The  financial 
system was characterised by extensive regulations such as administered interest rates, directed credit 
programmes, weak banking structure, lack of proper accounting and risk management systems and 
lack  of  transparency  in  operations  of  major  financial  market  participants  (Mohan,  2004b).  Such  a 
system hindered efficient allocation of resources. Financial sector reforms initiated in the early 1990s 
have attempted to overcome these weaknesses in order to enhance efficiency of resource allocation in 
the economy.  
Simultaneously,  the  Reserve  Bank  took  a  keen  interest  in  the  development  of  financial  markets, 
especially  the  money,  government  securities  and  forex  markets  in  view  of  their  critical  role  in  the 
transmission mechanism of monetary policy. As for other central banks, the money market is the focal 
point  for  intervention  by  the  Reserve  Bank  to  equilibrate  short-term  liquidity  flows  on  account  of  its 
linkages with the foreign exchange market. Similarly, the Government securities market is important 
for  the  entire  debt  market  as  it  serves  as  a  benchmark  for  pricing  other  debt  market  instruments, 
thereby aiding the monetary transmission process across the yield curve. The Reserve Bank had, in 
fact,  been  making  efforts  since  1986  to  develop  institutions  and  infrastructure  for  these  markets  to 
facilitate price discovery. These efforts by the Reserve Bank to develop efficient, stable and healthy 
financial  markets  accelerated  after  1991.  There  has  been  close  co-ordination  between  the  Central 
Government and the Reserve Bank, as also between different regulators, which helped in orderly and 
smooth development of the financial markets in India.  
What  have  been  the  major  contours  of  the  financial  sector  reforms  in  India?  For  the  sake  of 
completeness, it is useful to have a quick run-down of these: 
• 
• 
• 
Removal of the erstwhile existing financial repression 
Creation of an efficient, productive and profitable financial sector 
Enabling  the  process  of  price  discovery  by  the  market  determination  of  interest  rates  that 
improves allocative efficiency of resources 
Providing operational and functional autonomy to institutions 
Preparing the financial system for increasing international competition 
Opening the external sector in a calibrated manner; and  
Promoting financial stability in the wake of domestic and external shocks.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
The financial sector reforms since the early 1990s could be analytically classified into two phases.1 
The first phase - or the first generation of reforms - was aimed at creating an efficient, productive and 
profitable  financial  sector  which  would  function  in  an  environment  of  operational  flexibility  and 
functional autonomy. In the second phase, or the second generation reforms, which started in the mid-
1990s,  the  emphasis  of  reforms  has  been  on  strengthening  the  financial  system  and  introducing 
structural improvements. Against this brief overview of the philosophy of financial sector reforms, let 
me briefly touch upon reforms in various sectors and segments of the financial sector.  
Banking sector 
The main objective of banking sector reforms was to promote a diversified, efficient and competitive 
financial  system  with  the  ultimate  goal  of  improving  the  allocative  efficiency  of  resources  through 
operational  flexibility,  improved  financial  viability  and  institutional  strengthening.  The  reforms  have 
focussed  on  removing  financial  repression  through  reductions  in  statutory  pre-emptions,  while 
stepping up prudential regulations at the same time. Furthermore, interest rates on both deposits and 
lending of banks have been progressively deregulated (Box I).  
 
                                                      
1   Reddy  (2002)  noted  that  the  approach  towards  financial  sector  reforms  in  India  has  been  based  on  five  principles:  (i) 
cautious and appropriate sequencing of reform measures; (ii) introduction of mutually reinforcing norms; (iii) introduction of 
complementary  reforms  across  monetary,  fiscal  and  external  sectors;  (iv)  development  of  financial  institutions;  and  (v) 
development of financial markets.

As  the  Indian  banking  system  had  become  predominantly  government  owned  by  the  early  1990s, 
banking sector reforms essentially took a two pronged approach. First, the level of competition was 
gradually  increased  within  the  banking  system  while  simultaneously  introducing  international  best 
practices in prudential regulation and supervision tailored to Indian requirements. In particular, special 
emphasis was placed on building up the risk management capabilities of Indian banks while measures 
were  initiated  to  ensure  flexibility,  operational  autonomy  and  competition  in  the  banking  sector. 
Second,  active  steps  were  taken  to  improve  the  institutional  arrangements  including  the  legal 
framework and technological system. The supervisory system was revamped in view of the crucial role 
of supervision in the creation of an efficient banking system.  
Measures to improve the health of the banking system have included (i) restoration of public sector 
banks'  net  worth  through recapitalisation  where  needed;  (ii) streamlining  of  the  supervision  process 
with combination of on-site and off-site surveillance along with external auditing; (iii) introduction of risk 
based  supervision;  (iv)  introduction  of  the  process  of  structured  and  discretionary  intervention  for 
problem  banks  through  a  prompt  corrective  action  (PCA)  mechanism;  (v)  institutionalisation  of  a 
mechanism facilitating greater coordination for regulation and supervision of financial conglomerates; 
(vi)  strengthening  creditor  rights  (still  in  process);  and  (vii)  increased  emphasis  on  corporate 
governance. 
Consistent  with  the  policy  approach  to  benchmark  the  banking  system  to  the  best  international 
standards with emphasis on gradual harmonisation, all commercial banks in India are expected to start 
implementing Basel II with effect from March 31, 2007 – though a marginal stretching beyond this date 
should not be ruled out in view of the latest indications on the state of preparedness (Reddy, 2006a). 
Recognising the differences in degrees of sophistication and development of the banking system, it 
has been decided that the banks will initially adopt the Standardised Approach for credit risk and the 
Basic Indicator Approach for operational risk. After adequate skills are developed, both by the banks 
and  also  by  the  supervisors,  some  of  the  banks  may  be  allowed  to  migrate  to  the  Internal  Rating 
Based (IRB) Approach. Although implementation of Basel II will require more capital for banks in India, 
the cushion available in the system - at present, the Capital to Risk Assets Ratio (CRAR) is over 12 
per cent - provides some comfort. In order to provide banks greater flexibility and avenues for meeting 
the capital requirements, the Reserve Bank has issued policy guidelines enabling issuance of several 
instruments  by  the  banks  viz.,  innovative  perpetual  debt  instruments,  perpetual  non-cumulative 
preference shares, redeemable cumulative preference shares and hybrid debt instruments. 
Reforms in the monetary policy framework 
The  basic  emphasis  of  monetary  policy  since  the  initiation  of  reforms  has  been  to  reduce  market 
segmentation in the financial sector through increased interlinkages between various segments of the 
financial market including money, government security and forex market. The key policy development 
that  has  enabled  a  more  independent  monetary  policy  environment  as  well  as  the  development  of 
Government securities market was the discontinuation of automatic monetisation of the government's 
fiscal deficit since April 1997 through an agreement between the Government and the Reserve Bank 
of India in September 1994. In order to meet the challenges thrown by financial liberalisation and the 
growing complexities of monetary management, the Reserve Bank switched from a monetary targeting 
framework to a multiple indicator approach from 1998-99. Short-term interest rates have emerged as 
the key indicators of the monetary policy stance. A significant shift is the move towards market-based 
instruments away from direct instruments of monetary management. In line with international trends, 
the  Reserve  Bank  has  put  in  place  a  liquidity  management  framework  in  which  market  liquidity  is 
managed  through  a  mix  of  open  market  (including  repo)  operations  (OMOs),  changes  in  reserve 
requirements and standing facilities, reinforced by changes in the policy rates, including the Bank Rate 
and the short term (overnight) policy rate. In order to carry out these market operations effectively, the 
Reserve Bank has initiated several measures to strengthen the health of its balance sheet.  
Over  the  past  few  years,  the  process  of  monetary  policy  formulation  has  become  relatively  more 
articulate,  consultative  and  participative  with  external  orientation,  while  the  internal  work  processes 
have also been re-engineered. A recent notable step in this direction is the constitution of a Technical 
Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy comprising external experts to advise the Reserve Bank on 
the stance of monetary policy (Box II).

BOX II 
Reforms in the Monetary Policy Framework 
Objectives 
•  Twin objectives of “maintaining price stability” and “ensuring availability of adequate 
credit to productive sectors of the economy to support growth” continue to govern 
the stance of monetary policy, though the relative emphasis on these objectives has 
varied depending on the importance of maintaining an appropriate balance. 
•  Reflecting the increasing development of financial market and greater liberalisation, 
use  of  broad  money  as  an  intermediate  target  has  been  de-emphasised  and  a 
multiple indicator approach has been adopted. 
•  Emphasis has been put on development of multiple instruments to transmit liquidity 
and interest rate signals in the short-term in a flexible and bi-directional manner. 
Increase  of  the  interlinkage  between  various  segments  of  the  financial  market 
including money, government security and forex markets. 
   Instruments 
 •  Move  from  direct  instruments  (such  as,  administered  interest  rates,  reserve 
requirements, selective credit control) to indirect instruments (such as, open market 
operations, purchase and repurchase of government securities) for the conduct of 
monetary policy. 
Introduction of Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), which operates through repo and 
reverse repo auctions, effectively provide a corridor for short-term interest rate. LAF 
has  emerged  as  the  tool  for  both  liquidity  management  and  also  as  a  signalling 
devise for interest rate in the overnight market. 
•  Use  of  open  market  operations  to  deal  with  overall  market  liquidity  situation 
especially those emanating from capital flows. 
Introduction  of  Market  Stabilisation  Scheme  (MSS)  as  an  additional  instrument  to 
deal with enduring capital inflows without affecting short-term liquidity management 
role of LAF. 
 Developmental Measures 
•  Discontinuation  of  automatic  monetisation  through  an  agreement  between  the 
Government  and  the  Reserve  Bank.  Rationalisation  of  Treasury  Bill  market. 
Introduction of  delivery  versus payment  system  and  deepening  of  inter-bank repo 
market. 
Introduction of Primary Dealers in the government securities market to play the role 
of market maker. 
•  Amendment of Securities Contracts Regulation Act (SCRA), to create the regulatory 
 framework. 
•  Deepening  of  government  securities  market  by  making  the  interest  rates  on  such 
securities  market  related. 
Introduction  of  auction  of  government  securities. 
Development of a risk-free credible yield curve in the government securities market 
as a benchmark for related markets. 
•  Development  of  pure  inter-bank  call  money  market.  Non-bank  participants  to 
participate in other money market instruments.  
Introduction  of  automated  screen-based  trading  in  government  securities  through 
Negotiated Dealing System (NDS). Setting up of risk-free payments and system in 
government securities through Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL). Phased 
introduction of Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System. 
 •  Deepening of forex market and increased autonomy of Authorised Dealers. 
 
•  Setting  up  of  Technical  Advisory  Committee  on  Monetary  Policy  with  outside 
experts  to  review  macroeconomic  and  monetary  developments  and  advise  the 
Reserve Bank on the stance of monetary policy. 
•  Creation of a separate Financial Market Department within the RBI.

  Following the reforms, the financial markets have now grown in size, depth and activity paving the way 
for flexible use of indirect instruments by the Reserve Bank to pursue its objectives. It is recognised 
that stability in financial markets is critical for efficient price discovery. Excessive volatility in exchange 
rates  and  interest  rates  masks  the  underlying  value  of  these  variables  and  gives  rise  to  confusing 
signals. Since both the exchange rate and interest rate are the key prices reflecting the cost of money, 
it is particularly important for the efficient functioning of the economy that they be market determined 
and  be  easily  observed.  The  Reserve  Bank  has,  therefore,  put  in  place  a  liquidity  management 
framework  in  the  form  of  a  liquidity  adjustment  facility  (LAF)  for  the  facilitation  of  forex  and  money 
market  transactions  that  result  in  price  discovery  sans  excessive  volatility.  The  LAF  coupled  with 
OMOs and the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) has provided the Reserve Bank greater flexibility 
to manage market liquidity in consonance with its policy stance. The introduction of LAF had several 
advantages (Mohan, 2006b).  
• 
First  and  foremost,  it  helped  the  transition  from  direct  instruments  of  monetary  control  to 
indirect and, in the process, certain dead weight loss for the system was saved.  
Second, it has provided monetary authorities with greater flexibility in determining both the 
quantum of adjustment as well as the rates by responding to the needs of the system on a 
daily basis.  
Third, it enabled the Reserve Bank to modulate the supply of funds on a daily basis to meet 
day-to-day liquidity mismatches.  
Fourth, it enabled the Reserve Bank to affect demand for funds through policy rate changes.  
Fifth and most important, it helped stabilise short-term money market rates. 
• 
• 
LAF has now emerged as the principal operating instrument of monetary policy. Although there is no 
formal  targeting  of  a  point  overnight  interest  rate,  the  LAF  is  designed  to  nudge  overnight  interest 
rates  within  a  specified  corridor,  the  difference  between  the  fixed  repo  and  reverse  repo  rates 
currently being 100 basis points. The evidence suggests that this effort has been largely successful 
with the overnight interest rate moving out of this corridor for only a few brief periods. The LAF has 
enabled  the  Reserve  Bank  to  de-emphasise  targeting  of  bank  reserves  and  focus  increasingly  on 
interest  rates.  This  has  helped  in  reducing  the  cash  reserve  ratio  (CRR)  without  loss  of  monetary 
control.  
Given  the  growing  role  played  by  expectations,  the  stance  of  monetary  policy  and  its  rationale  are 
communicated  to  the  public  in  a  variety  of  ways.  The  enactment  of  the  Fiscal  Responsibility  and 
Budget Management Act, 2003 has strengthened the institutional mechanism further: from April 2006 
onwards, the Reserve Bank is no longer permitted to subscribe to government securities in the primary 
market.  The  development  of  the  monetary  policy  framework  has  also  involved  a  great  deal  of 
institutional initiatives to enable efficient functioning of the money market: development of appropriate 
trading, payments and settlement systems along with technological infrastructure.  
Financial markets 
The  success  of  a  framework  that  relies  on  indirect  instruments  of  monetary  management  such  as 
interest rates, is contingent upon the extent and speed with which changes in the central bank's policy 
rate are transmitted to the spectrum of market interest rates and exchange rate in the economy and 
onward  to  the  real  sector.  Given  the  critical  role  played  by  financial  markets  in  this  transmission 
mechanism, the Reserve Bank has taken a number of initiatives to develop a pure inter-bank money 
market. A noteworthy and desirable development has been the substantial migration of money market 
activity  from  the  uncollateralised  call  money  segment  to  the  collateralised  market  repo  and 
collateralised  borrowing  and  lending  obligations  (CBLO)  markets.  The  shift  of  activity  from 
uncollateralised to collateralised segments of the market has largely resulted from measures relating 
to limiting the call market transactions to banks and primary dealers only. This policy-induced shift is in 
the interest of financial stability and is yielding results. 
Concomitantly, efforts have been made to broaden and deepen the Government securities market and 
foreign exchange market so as to enable the process of efficient price discovery in respect of interest 
rates and the exchange rate (Boxes III and IV).  
It is pertinent to note that the phased approach to development of financial markets has enabled RBI's 
withdrawal from the primary market since April 1, 2006. This step completes the transition to a fully 
6 
 BIS Review 50/2006
market based system in the G-sec market. Looking ahead, as per the recommendations of the Twelfth 
Finance  Commission,  the  Central  Government  would  cease  to  raise  resources  on  behalf  of  State 
Governments,  who,  henceforth,  have  to  access  the  market  directly.  Thus,  State  Governments' 
capability in raising resources will be market determined and based on their own financial health. In 
order to ensure a smooth transition to the new regime, restructuring of current institutional processes 
has already been initiated (Mohan, 2006c). These steps are helping to achieve the desired integration 
in the conduct of monetary operations. 
 
Reforms in the Government Securities Market 
Box III 
Institutional Measures  
          Administered interest rates on government securities were replaced by an auction system for 
price discovery.  
Automatic  monetisation  of  fiscal  deficit  through  the  issue  of  ad  hoc  Treasury  Bills  was 
phased out.  
Primary  Dealers  (PD)  were  introduced  as  market  makers  in  the  government  securities 
market.  
For ensuring transparency in the trading of government securities, Delivery versus Payment 
(DvP) settlement system was introduced.  
Repurchase  agreement  (repo)  was  introduced  as  a  tool  of  short-term  liquidity  adjustment. 
Subsequently, the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) was introduced. 
LAF operates through repo and reverse repo auctions and provide a corridor for short-term 
interest rate. LAF has emerged as the tool for both liquidity management and also signalling 
device for interest rates in the overnight market. The Second LAF (SLAF) was introduced in 
November 2005.  
Market  Stabilisation  Scheme  (MSS)  has  been  introduced,  which  has  expanded  the 
instruments available to the Reserve Bank for managing the enduring surplus liquidity in the 
system. 
Effective April 1, 2006, RBI has withdrawn from participating in primary market auctions of 
Government paper. 
Banks have been permitted to undertake primary dealer business while primary dealers are 
being allowed to diversify their business.  
Short  sales  in  Government  securities  is  being  permitted  in  a  calibrated  manner  while 
guidelines for ‘when issued’ market have been issued recently.  
 
Increase in Instruments in the Government Securities Market  
•  91-day Treasury bill was introduced for managing liquidity and benchmarking. Zero Coupon 
Bonds,  Floating  Rate  Bonds,  Capital  Indexed  Bonds  were  issued  and  exchange  traded 
interest  rate  futures  were  introduced.  OTC  interest  rate  derivatives  like  IRS/  FRAs  were 
introduced. 
•  Outright sale of Central Government dated security that are not owned have been permitted, 
subject to the same being covered by outright purchase from the secondary market within the 
same trading day subject to certain conditions. 
•  Repo status has been granted to State Government securities in order to improve secondary 
market liquidity. 
 
Enabling Measures  
•  Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were allowed to invest in government securities subject to 
certain limits.  
Introduction of automated screen-based trading in government securities through Negotiated 
Dealing System (NDS).  
•  Setting  up  of  risk-free  payments  and  settlement  system  in  government  securities  through 
 Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL).  
•  Phased introduction of Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS).  
• 
Introduction of trading in government securities on stock exchanges for promoting retailing in 
such securities, permitting non-banks to participate in repo market. 
•  Recent measures include introduction of NDS-OM and T+1 settlement norms.

As  regards  the  foreign  exchange  market,  reforms  focused  on  market  development  with  inbuilt 
prudential safeguards so that the market would not be destabilised in the process (Reddy, 2002). The 
move towards a market-based exchange rate regime in 1993 and the subsequent adoption of current 
account convertibility were the key measures in reforming the Indian foreign exchange market. Banks 
are increasingly being given greater autonomy to undertake foreign exchange operations. In order to 
deepen the foreign exchange market, a large number of products have been introduced and entry of 
new players has been allowed in the market (Box IV). 
Summing  up,  reforms  were  designed  to  enable  the  process  of  efficient  price  discovery  and  induce 
greater internal efficiency in resource allocation within the banking system. While the policy measures 
in the pre-1990s period were essentially devoted to financial deepening, the focus of reforms in the 
last  decade  and  a  half  has  been  engendering  greater  efficiency  and  productivity  in  the  banking 
system. Reforms in the monetary policy framework were aimed at providing operational flexibility to 
the  Reserve  Bank  in  its  conduct  of  monetary  policy  by  relaxing  the  constraint  imposed  by  passive 
monetisation of the fisc.

Financial sector and monetary policy reforms: an assessment 
Banking sector 
An  assessment  of  the  banking  sector  shows  that  banks  have  experienced  strong  balance  sheet 
growth  in  the  post-reform  period  in  an  environment  of  operational  flexibility.  Improvement  in  the 
financial health of banks, reflected in significant improvement in capital adequacy and improved asset 
quality, is distinctly visible. It is noteworthy that this progress has been achieved despite the adoption 
of international best practices in prudential norms. Competitiveness and productivity gains have also 
been enabled by proactive technological deepening and flexible human resource management. These 
significant gains have been achieved even while renewing our goals of social banking viz., maintaining 
the  wide  reach  of  the  banking  system  and  directing  credit  towards  important  but  disadvantaged 
sectors  of  society.  A  brief  discussion  on  the  performance  of  the  banking  sector  under  the  reform 
process is given below. 
Spread of banking 
The banking system's wide reach, judged in terms of expansion of branches and the growth of credit 
and deposits indicates continued financial deepening (Table 1). The population per bank branch has 
not changed much since the 1980s, and has remained at around 16,000.

In the post-reform period, banks have consistently maintained high rates of growth in their assets and 
liabilities. On the liability side, deposits continue to account for about 80 per cent of the total liabilities. 
On the asset side, the shares of loans and advances on the one hand and investments on the other 
hand have seen marked cycles, reflecting banks' portfolio preferences as well as growth cycles in the 
economy.  The  share  of  loans  and  advances  declined  in  the  second  half  of  1990s  responding  to 
slowdown in investment demand as well as tightening of prudential norms. With investment demand 
again  picking  up  in  the  past  3-4  years,  banks'  credit  portfolio  has  witnessed  sharp  growth.  Banks' 
investment  in  gilts  have  accordingly  seen  a  significant  decline  in the  past  one  year,  although  it  still 
remains above the minimum statutory requirement. Thus, while in the 1990s, greater investments and 
aversion  to  credit  risk  exposure  may  have  deterred  banks  from  undertaking  their  ‘core  function’  of 
financial  intermediation  viz.,  accepting  deposits  and  extending  credit,  they  seem  to  have  struck  a 
greater  balance  in  recent  years  between  investments  and  loans  and  advances.  The  improved 
atmosphere  for  recovery  created  in  the  recent  years  seems  to  have  induced  banks  to  put  greater 
efforts in extending loans.

Capital position and asset quality 
Since  the  beginning  of  reforms,  a  set  of  micro-prudential  measures  have  been  stipulated  aimed  at 
imparting  strength  to  the  banking  system  as  well  as  ensuring  safety.  With  regard  to  prudential 
requirements, income recognition and asset classification (IRAC) norms have been strengthened to 
approach international best practice. Initially, while it was deemed to attain a CRAR of 8 per cent in a 
phased manner, it was subsequently raised to 9 per cent with effect from 1999-2000. 
The  overall  capital  position  of  commercial  banks  has  witnessed  a  marked  improvement  during  the 
reform  period  (Table  2).  Illustratively,  as  at  end-March  2005,  86  out  of  the  88  commercial  banks 
operating in India maintained CRAR at or above 9 per cent. The corresponding figure for 1995-96 was 
54  out  of  92  banks.  Improved  capitalisation  of  public  sector  banks  was  initially  brought  through 
substantial  infusion  of  funds  by  government  to  recapitalise  these  banks.  Subsequently,  in  order  to 
mitigate the budgetary impact and to introduce market discipline, public sector banks were allowed to 
raise funds from the market through equity issuance subject to the maintenance of 51 per cent public 
ownership.  Ownership  in  public  sector  banks  is  now  well  diversified.  As  at  end-March  2005,  the 
holding  by  the  general  public  in  six  banks  ranged  between  40  and  49  per  cent  and  in  12  banks 
between 30 and 49 per cent. It was only in four banks that the Government holding was more than 90 
per cent.

 BIS Review 50/2006
Despite  tightening  norms,  there  has  been  considerable  improvement  in  the  asset  quality  of  banks. 
India  transited  to  a  90-day  NPL  recognition  norm  (from  180-day  norm)  in  2004.  Nonetheless,  non-
performing loans (NPLs), as ratios of both total advances and assets, have declined substantially and 
consistently since the mid-1990s (Table 3). Improvement in the credit appraisal process, upturn of the 
business cycle, new initiatives for resolution of NPLs (including promulgation of the Securitisation and 
Reconstruction  of  Financial  Assets  and  Enforcement  of  Security  Interest  (SARFAESI)  Act),  and 
greater provisioning and write-off of NPLs enabled by greater profitability, have kept incremental NPLs 
low. 
Competition and efficiency 
In  consonance  with  the  objective  of  enhancing  efficiency  and  productivity  of  banks  through  greater 
competition - from new private sector banks and entry and expansion of several foreign banks - there 
has been a consistent decline in the share of public sector banks in total assets of commercial banks. 
Notwithstanding such transformation, the public sector banks still account for nearly three-fourths of 
assets and income. Public sector banks have also responded to the new challenges of competition, as 
reflected in their increased share in the overall profit of the banking sector. This suggests that, with 
operational flexibility, public sector banks are competing relatively effectively with private sector and 
foreign  banks.  Public  sector  bank  managements  are  now  probably  more  attuned  to  the  market 
consequences of their activities (Mohan, 2006a). Shares of Indian private sector banks, especially new 
private sector banks established in the 1990s, in the total income and assets of the banking system 
have improved considerably since the mid-1990s (Table 4). The reduction in the asset share of foreign 
banks,  however,  is  partially  due  to  their  increased  focus  on  off-balance  sheet  non-fund  based 
business.

Efficiency gains are also reflected in containment of the operating expenditure as a proportion of total 
assets (Table 5). This has been achieved in spite of large expenditures incurred by Indian banks in 
installation and upgradation of information technology and, in the case of public sector banks, large 
expenditures under voluntary pre-mature retirement of nearly 12 per cent of their total staff strength.

Improvements  in  efficiency  of  the  banking  system  are  also  reflected,  inter  alia,  in  costs  of 
intermediation. which, defined as the ratio of operating expense to total assets, witnessed a gradual 
reduction  in  the  post  reform  period  across  various  bank  groups  barring  foreign  banks  (Table  6). 
However,  intermediation  costs  of  banks  in  India  still  tend  to  be  higher  than  those  in  developed 
countries. Similarly, the cost income-ratio (defined as the ratio of operating expenses to total income 
less interest expense) of Indian banks has shown a declining trend during the post reform period. For 
example,  Indian  banks  paid  roughly  45  per  cent  of  their  net  income  towards  managing  labour  and 
12 
 BIS Review 50/2006
physical  capital  in  2004  as  against  nearly  72  per  cent  in  1993  (Mohan,  2006a).  Indian  banks  thus 
recorded a net cost saving of nearly 27 per cent of their net income during the post reform period.  
Productivity 
What is most encouraging is the very significant improvement in the productivity of the Indian banking 
system,  in  terms  of  various  productivity  indicators.  The  business  per  employee  of  Indian  banks 
increased over three-fold in real terms from Rs.5.4 million in 1992 to Rs.17.3 million in 2005, exhibiting 
an annual compound growth rate of more than 9 per cent (Table 7). The profit per employee increased 
from Rs.20,000 to Rs. 130,000 over the same period, implying a compound growth of around 15.5 per 
cent.  Branch  productivity  also  recorded  concomitant  improvements.  These  improvements  could  be 
driven by two factors: technological improvement, which expands the range of production possibilities 
and a catching up effect, as peer pressure amongst banks compels them to raise productivity levels. 
Here, the role of new business practices, new approaches and expansion of the business that was 
introduced by the new private banks has been of the utmost importance.

 Monetary policy 
 
of monetary policy, let me focus on some select elements.  
What has been the impact of the monetary policy? From the innumerable dimensions of impact 
Inflation 
Turning to an assessment of monetary policy, it would be reasonable to assert that monetary policy 
has been largely successful in meeting its key objectives in the post-reforms period. Just as the late 
1990s witnessed a fall in inflation worldwide, so too has India. Inflation has averaged close to five per 
cent per annum in the decade gone by, notably lower than that of eight per cent in the previous four 
decades  (Chart  1).  Structural  reforms  since  the  early  1990s  coupled  with  improved  monetary-fiscal 
interface and reforms in the Government securities market enabled better monetary management from 
the second half of the 1990s onwards. More importantly, the regime of low and stable inflation has, in 
turn,  stabilised  inflation  expectations  and  inflation  tolerance  in  the  economy  has  come  down.  It  is 
encouraging to note that despite record high international crude oil prices, inflation remains low and 
inflation  expectations  also  remain  stable.  Since  inflation  expectations  are  a  key  determinant  of  the 
actual  inflation  outcome,  and  given  the  lags  in  monetary  transmission,  we  have  been  taking  pre-
emptive  measures  to  keep  inflation  expectations  stable.2  As  discussed  further  below,  a  number  of 
instruments, both existing as well as new, were employed to modulate liquidity conditions to achieve 
the  desired  objectives.  A  number  of  other  factors  such  as  increased  competition,  productivity  gains

2004.

and  strong  corporate  balance  sheets  have  also  contributed  to  this  low  and  stable  inflation 
environment, but it appears that calibrated monetary measures had a substantial role to play as well.

 Challenges posed by large capital inflows 
It is pertinent to note that inflation could be contained since the mid-1990s, despite challenges posed 
by large capital flows. Following the reforms in the external sector, foreign investment flows have been 
encouraged. Reflecting the strong growth prospects of the Indian economy, the country has received 
large investment inflows, both direct and portfolio, since 1993-94 as compared with negligible levels till 
the early 1990s. Total foreign investment flows (direct and portfolio) increased from US$ 111 million in 
1990-91  to  US$  17,496  million  in  2005-06  (April-February).  Over  the  same  period,  current  account 
deficits remained modest – averaging one per cent of GDP since 1991-92 and in fact recorded small 
surpluses  during  2001-04.  With  capital  flows  remaining  in  excess  of  the  current  financing 
requirements, the overall balance of payments recorded persistent surpluses leading to an increase in 
reserves. Despite such large accretion to reserves, inflation could be contained reflecting appropriate 
policy responses by the Reserve Bank and the Government.  
The  emergence  of  foreign  exchange  surplus  lending  to  continuing  and  large  accretion  to  reserves 
since  the  mid  1990s  has  been  a  novel  experience  for  India  after  experiencing  chronic  balance  of 
payment problems for almost four decades. These surpluses began to arise after the opening of the 
current account, reduction in trade protection, and partial opening of the capital account from the early 
to mid 1990s. The exchange rate flexibility practiced since 1992-93 has been an important part of the 
policy response needed to manage capital flows. 
The  composition  of  India's  balance  of  payments  has  undergone  significant  change  since  the  mid 
1990s. In the current account, the growth of software exports and, more recently, of business process 
outsourcing, has increased the share of service exports on a continuing basis. Even more significant is 
the  growth  in  remittances  from  non-resident  Indians  (NRIs),  now  amounting  to  about  3  per  cent  of 
GDP.  The  latter  exhibit  a  great  deal  of  stability.  The  remittances  appear  to  consist  mainly  of 
maintenance  flows  that  do  not  seem  to  be  affected  by  exchange  rate,  inflation,  or  growth  rate 
changes.  Thus,  the  Indian  current  account  exhibits  only  a  small  deficit,  or  a  surplus,  despite  the 
existence of merchandise trade deficit that has grown from 3.2 per cent of GDP in the mid 1990s to 
5.3 per cent in 2004-05. On the capital account, unlike other emerging markets, portfolio flows have far 
exceeded foreign direct investment in India in recent years. Coupled with other capital flows consisting 
of official and commercial debt, NRI deposits, and other banking capital, net capital flows now amount 
to about 4.4 per cent of GDP.

 BIS Review 50/2006
The downturn in the Indian business cycle during the early part of this decade led to the emergence of 
a current account surplus, particularly because the existence of the relative exchange rate insensitive 
remittance  flows.  Consequently,  foreign  exchange  reserves  grew  by  more  than  US  $  120  billion 
between April 2000 and April 2006. 
The management of these flows involved a mix of policy responses that had to keep an eye on the 
level  of  reserves,  monetary  policy  objectives  related  to  the  interest  rate,  liquidity  management,  and 
maintenance  of  healthy  financial  market  conditions  with  financial  stability.  Decisions  to  do  with 
sterilisation  involve  judgements  on  the  character  of  the  excess  forex  flows:  are  they  durable,  semi-
durable or transitory. This judgement itself depends on assessments about both the real economy and 
of financial sector developments. Moreover, at any given time, some flows could be of an enduring 
nature whereas others could be of short term, and hence reversible. 
On an operational basis, sterilisation operations through open market operations (OMOs) should take 
care of durable flows, whereas transitory flows can be managed through the normal daily operations of 
the LAF. 
By 2003-04, sterilisation operations, however, started appearing to be constrained by the finite stock of 
Government  securities  held  by  the  Reserve  Bank.  The  legal  restrictions  on  the  Reserve  Bank  on 
issuing  its  own  paper  also  placed  constraints  on  future  sterilisation  operations.  Accordingly,  an 
innovative  scheme  in  the  form  of  Market  Stabilisation  Scheme  (MSS)  was  introduced  in  April  2004 
wherein  Government  of  India  dated  securities/Treasury  Bills  are  being  issued  to  absorb  enduring 
surplus liquidity. These dated securities/Treasury Bills are the same as those issued for normal market 
borrowings  and  this  avoids  segmentation  of  the  market.  Moreover,  the  MSS  scheme  brings 
transparency  in  regard  to  costs  associated  with  sterilisation  operations.  Hitherto,  the  costs  of 
sterilisation were fully borne by the Reserve Bank in the first instance and its impact was transmitted to 
the  Government  in  the  form  of  lower  profit  transfers.  With  the  introduction  of  the  MSS,  the  cost  in 
terms of interest payments would be borne by the Government itself in a transparent manner.  
It is relevant to note that the MSS has provided the Reserve Bank the flexibility to not only absorb 
liquidity but also to inject liquidity in case of need. This was evident during the second half of 2005-06 
when  liquidity  conditions  became  tight  in  view  of  strong  credit  demand,  increase  in  Government’s 
surplus  with  the  Reserve  Bank  and  outflows  on  account  of  bullet  redemption  of  India  Millennium 
Deposits (about US $ 7 billion). In view of these circumstances, fresh issuances under the MSS were 
suspended between November 2005 and April 2006. Redemptions of securities/Treasury Bills issued 
earlier  –  along  with  active  management  of  liquidity  through  repo/reverse  repo  operations  under 
Liquidity  Adjustment  Facility  -  provided  liquidity  to  the  market  and  imparted  stability  to  financial 
markets (Chart 2). With liquidity conditions improving, it was decided to again start issuing securities 
under the MSS from May 2006 onwards. The issuance of securities under the MSS has thus enabled 
the Reserve Bank to improve liquidity management in the system, to maintain stability in the foreign 
exchange market and to conduct monetary policy in accordance with the stated objectives.

The Indian experience highlights the need for emerging market economies to allow greater flexibility in 
exchange  rates but  the  authorities can  also benefit from  having  the capacity  to  intervene  in  foreign 
exchange markets in view of the volatility observed in international capital flows. A key lesson is that 
flexibility and pragmatism are required in the management of the exchange rate and monetary policy 
in developing countries, rather than adherence to strict theoretical rules. 
Three overarching features marked the transition of India to an open economy. First, the administered 
exchange  rate  became  market  determined  and  ensuring  orderly  conditions  in  the  foreign  exchange 
market  became  an  objective  of  exchange  rate  management.  Second,  as  already  indicated, 
vicissitudes in capital flows came to influence the conduct of monetary policy. Third, lessons of the 
balance of  payments crisis  highlighted  the  need  to maintain an adequate  level  of  foreign exchange 
reserves  and  this  in  turn  both  enabled  and  constrained  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy.  From 
hindsight, it appears that the strategy paid off with the exchange rate exhibiting reasonable two-way 
movement (Chart 3).

  Credit delivery 
Given that the Indian financial system is still predominantly bank based, bank credit continues to be 
of  great  importance  for  funding  different  sectors  of  the  economy.  Consequent  to  deregulation  of 
interest rates and substantial reduction in statutory pre-emptions, there was an expectation that credit 
flow  would  be  correspondingly  enhanced.  In  the  event,  banks  continued  to  show  a  marked 
preference for investments in government securities with no reduction in the proportion of their assets 
being held in investments in government securities, until recently, when credit growth picked up in 
2003-04.  With  the  shift  in  approach  from  micro  management  of  credit  through  various  regulations, 
credit  allocation  targets,  and  administered  interest  rates,  to  a  risk  based  system  of  lending  and 
market  determined  interest  rates,  banks  have  to  develop  appropriate  credit  risk  assessment 
techniques.  Apart  from  promoting  healthy  credit  growth,  this  is  also  critical  for  the  efficiency  of 
monetary management in view of the move to use of indirect instruments in monetary management. 
The  stagnation  in  credit  flow  observed  during  the  late  1990s,  in  retrospect,  was  partly  caused  by 
reduction in demand on account of increase in real interest rates, turn down in the business cycle, 
and the significant business restructuring that occurred during that period. A sharp recovery has now 
taken place. 
The stagnation during the 1990s has seen a sharp recovery in the past few years. The credit-GDP 
ratio, after moving in a narrow range of around 30 per cent between the mid-1980s and late 1990s, 
started increasing from 2000-01 onwards (Chart 4). It increased from 30 per cent during 1999-00 to 41 
per cent during 2004-05 and further to 48 per cent during 2005-06. However, sharp growth of credit in 
16 
 BIS Review 50/2006
the past couple of years has also led to some areas of policy concern and dilemmas, as discussed 
later.

How did the monetary policy support the growth momentum in the economy? As inflation, along with 
inflation  expectations,  fell  during  the  earlier  period  of  this  decade,  policy  interest  rates  were  also 
brought  down.  Consequently,  both  nominal  and  real  interest  rates  fell.  The  growth  rate  in  interest 
expenses of the corporates declined consistently since 1995-96, from 25.0 per cent to a negative of 
11.5 per cent in 2003-04 (Table 8). Such decline in interest costs has significant implications for the 
improvement in bottom lines of the corporates. Various indicators pertaining to interest costs, which 
can throw light on the impact of interest costs on corporate sector profits have turned positive in recent 
years.

Some emerging issues 
IV.  
This  review  of  financial  sector  reforms  and  monetary  policy  has  documented  the  calibrated  and 
coordinated reforms that have been undertaken in India since the 1990s. In terms of outcomes, this 
strategy has achieved the broad objectives of price stability along with reduced medium and long term 
inflation  expectations;  the  installation  of  an  institutional  framework  and  policy  reform  promoting 
relatively  efficient  price  discovery  of  interest  rates  and  the  exchange  rate;  phased  introduction  of 
competition  in  banking  along  with  corresponding  improvements  in  regulation  and  supervision 
approaching international best practice, which has led to notable improvement in banking performance 
and financials. The implementation of these reforms has also involved the setting up or improvement 
of key financial infrastructure such as payment and settlement systems, and clearing and settlement 
systems  for debt  and  forex  market  functioning.  All  of  this  financial  development  has  been  achieved 
with  the  maintenance  of  a  great  degree  of  financial  stability,  along  with  overall  movement  of  the 
economy towards a higher growth path. 
With increased deregulation of financial markets and increased integration of the global economy, the 
1990s were turbulent for global financial markets: 63 countries suffered from systemic banking crises 
in that decade, much higher than 45 in the 1980s. Among countries that experienced such crises, the 
direct cost of reconstructing the financial system was typically very high: for example, recapitalisation 
of banks had cost 55 per cent of GDP in Argentina, 42 per cent in Thailand, 35 per cent in Korea and 
10 per cent in Turkey. There were high indirect costs of lost opportunities and slow economic growth in 
addition  (McKinsey  &  Co.,  2005).  It  is  therefore  particularly  noteworthy  that  India  could  pursue  its 
process of financial deregulation and opening of the economy without suffering financial crises during 
this turbulent period in world financial markets. The cost of recapitalisation of public sector banks at 
less than 1 per cent of GDP is therefore low in comparison. Whereas we can be legitimately gratified 
with this performance record, we now need to focus on the new issues that need to be addressed for 
the next phase of financial development. 
That current annual GDP growth of around 8 per cent can be achieved in India at an about 30 per cent 
rate of gross domestic investment suggests that the economy is functioning quite efficiently. We need 
to ensure that we maintain this level of efficiency and attempt to improve on it further. As the Indian 
economy  continues  on  such  a  growth  path  and  attempts  to  accelerate  it,  new  demands  are  being 
placed on the financial system. 
Growth challenges for the financial sector 
Higher  sustained  growth  is  contributing  to  the  movement  of  large  numbers  of  households  into  ever 
higher income categories, and hence higher consumption categories, along with enhanced demand 
for  financial  savings  opportunities.  In  rural  areas  in  particular,  there  also  appears  to  be  increasing 
diversification of productive opportunities. Thus, the banking system has to extend itself and innovate 
to respond to these new demands for both consumption and production purposes. This is particularly 
important since banking penetration is still low in India: there are only about 10-12 ATMs in India per 
million population, as compared with over 50 in China, 170 in Thailand, and 500 in Korea. Moreover, 
the  deposit  to  GDP  ratio  or  the  loans/GDP  ratio  is  also  low  compared  to  other  Asian  countries 
(McKinsey & Co., 2005).  
On the production side, industrial expansion has accelerated; merchandise trade growth is high; and 
there  are  vast  demands  for  infrastructure  investment,  from  the  public  sector,  private  sector  and 
through public private partnerships. Furthermore, it is the service sector that has exhibited consistently 
high growth rates: the hospitality industry, shopping malls, entertainment industry, medical facilities, 
and  the  like,  are  all  expanding  fast.  Thus  a  great  degree  of  diversification  is  taking  place  in  the 
economy and the banking system has to respond adequately to these new challenges, opportunities 
and risks.  
In  dealing  with  these  new  consumer  demands  and  production  demands  of  rural  enterprises  and  of 
SME's in urban areas, banks have to innovate and look for new delivery mechanisms that economise 
on transaction costs and provide better access to the currently under-served. Innovative channels for 
credit  delivery  for  serving  these  new  rural  credit  needs,  encompassing  full  supply  chain  financing, 
covering  storage,  warehousing,  processing,  and  transportation  from  farm  to  market  will  have  to  be 
found.  The  budding  expansion  of  non-agriculture  service  enterprises  in  rural  areas  will  have  to  be 
financed to generate new income and employment opportunities. Greater efforts will need to be made 
on  information  technology  for  record  keeping,  service  delivery,  reduction  in  transactions  costs,  risk 
18 
 BIS Review 50/2006
assessment and risk management. Banks will have to invest in new skills through new recruitment and 
through intensive training of existing personnel. 
It is the public sector banks that have the large and widespread reach, and hence have the potential 
for contributing effectively to achieve financial inclusion. But it is also they who face the most difficult 
challenges in human resource development. They will have to invest very heavily in skill enhancement 
at all levels: at the top level for new strategic goal setting; at the middle level for implementing these 
goals; and at the cutting edge lower levels for delivering the new service modes. Given the current age 
composition of employees in these banks, they will also face new recruitment challenges in the face of 
adverse  compensation  structures  in  comparison  with  the  freer  private  sector.  Meanwhile,  the  new 
private sector banks will themselves have to innovate and accelerate their reach into the emerging low 
income  and  rural  market  segments.  They  have  the  independence  and  flexibility  to  find  the  new 
business models necessary for serving these segments. 
A  number  of  policy  initiatives  are  underway  to  aid  this  overall  process  of  financial  inclusion  and 
increase in banking penetration. The Parliament has passed the Credit Information Bureau Act that will 
enable the setting up of credit information bureaus through the mandatory sharing of information by 
banks. The Reserve Bank is in the process of issuing guidelines for the formation of these bureaus. As 
this  process  gathers  force,  it  should  contribute  greatly  in  reducing  the  costs  of  credit  quality 
assessment.  Second,  considerable  work  is  in  process  for  promoting  micro-finance  in  the  country, 
including the consideration of possible legislation for regulation of micro-finance institutions. Third, the 
Reserve Bank has issued guidelines to banks enabling the outsourcing of certain functions including 
the use of agencies such as post offices for achieving better outreach. These are all efforts in the right 
direction, but much more needs to be done to really achieve financial inclusion in India. 
The challenges that are emerging are right across the size spectrum of business activities. On the one 
hand,  the  largest  firms  are  attaining  economic  sizes  such  that  they  are  reaching  the  prudential 
exposure limits of banks, even though they are still small relative to the large global MNCs. On the 
other  hand,  with  changes  in  technology,  there  is  new  activity  at  the  small  and  medium  level  in  all 
spheres  of  activity.  To  cope  with  the  former,  the  largest  Indian  banks  have  to  be  encouraged  to 
expand fast, both through organic growth and through consolidation; and the corporate debt market 
has to be developed to enable further direct recourse to financial markets for the largest firms. For 
serving and contributing to the growth of firms at the lower end, banks have to strengthen their risk 
assessment systems, along with better risk management. Funding new entrepreneurs and activities is 
a fundamentally risky business because of the lack of a previous record and inadequate availability of 
collateral, but it is the job of banks to take such risk, but in a measured fashion. Given the history of 
public sector banks outlined earlier, such a change in approach requires a change in mind set, but 
also focused training in risk assessment, risk management, and marketing. 
Various policy measures are in process to help this transition along. The Reserve Bank issued new 
guidelines in 2004 on "Ownership and Governance in Private Sector Banks". These guidelines have 
increased the minimum capital for private sector banks to Rs.3 billion; provided enhanced guidance on 
the fit and proper nature of owners, board members and top management of these banks; and placed 
limitations  on  the  extent  of  dominant  shareholdings.  These  measures  are  designed  to  promote  the 
healthy growth of private sector banks and along with better corporate governance as they assume 
greater weight in the economy. An issue of relevance here is that of financial stability. To a certain 
extent,  the  predominance  of  government  owned  banks  has  contributed  to  financial  stability  in  the 
country. Experience has shown that even the deterioration in bank financials does not lead to erosion 
of consumer confidence in such banks. This kind of consumer confidence does not extend to private 
sector  banks.  Hence,  as  they  gain  in  size  and  share,  capital  enhancement  and  sound  corporate 
governance  become  essential  for  financial  stability.  Second,  the  lending  ability  of  banks  has  been 
potentially constrained by the existing provisions for statutory pre-emption of funds for investment in 
government  securities.  A  bill  has  been  introduced  in  Parliament  to  amend  the  existing  Banking 
Regulation Act to eliminate the minimum 25 per cent limit of investment in government securities. As 
the  fiscal  situation  improves  consistent  with  the  FRBM  Act,  it  will  then  be  possible  to  reduce  the 
statutory pre-emption, enabling greater fund flow to the private sector for growth. Third, the bill also 
provides for raising of capital through BASEL II consistent innovative instruments, enabling the capital 
expansion of banks needed for their growth. 
BIS Review 50/2006

Greater capital market openness: some issues 
An  important  feature  of  the  Indian  financial  reform  process  has  been  the  calibrated  opening  of  the 
capital account along with current account convertibility. The Government and the Reserve Bank have 
already  appointed  a  Committee  to  advise  on  a  roadmap  for  fuller  capital  account  convertibility. 
Decisions on further steps will be taken after that committee submits its report in a couple of months. 
Meanwhile,  we  can  note  some  of  the  issues  that  will  need  attention  as  we  achieve  fuller  capital 
account openness. 
A key component of Indian capital account management has been the management of volatility in the 
forex market, and of its consequential impact on the money market and hence on monetary operations 
guided  by  the  extant  monetary  policy  objectives.  This  has  been  done,  as  outlined,  through  a 
combination  of  forex  market  intervention,  domestic  liquidity  management,  and  administrative 
instructions on regulating external debt in different forms. Correspondingly, progress has been made 
on  the  functioning  of  the  government  securities  market,  forex  market  and  money  market  and  their 
progressive integration. Particular attention has been given to the exposure of financial intermediaries 
to  foreign  exchange  liabilities,  and  of  the  government  in  their  borrowing  programme.  So  far,  some 
degree  of  success  has  been  achieved  in  that  the  exchange  rate  responds  to  the  supply  demand 
conditions in the market and exhibits two way flexibility; the interest rate is similarly flexible and market 
determined; healthy growth has taken place in trade in both goods and services; and inward capital 
flows have been healthy. 
We  have  to  recognise  that  fuller  capital  account  openness  will  lead  to  a  confrontation  with  the 
impossible  trinity  of  simultaneous  attainment  of  independent  monetary  policy,  open  capital  account, 
and managed exchange rate. At best, only two out of the three would be feasible. With a more open 
capital account as a `given' and if a choice is made of an `anchor' role for monetary policy, exchange 
rate  management  will  be  affected.  A  freely  floating  exchange  rate  should,  in  fact,  engender  the 
independence of monetary policy. It needs to be recognised, however, that the impact of exchange 
rate  changes  on  the  real  sector  is  significantly  different  for  reserve  currency  countries  and  for 
developing countries like India. For the former which specialise in technology intensive products the 
degree of exchange rate pass through is low, enabling exporters and importers to ignore temporary 
shocks  and  set  stable  product  prices  to  maintain  monopolistic  positions,  despite  large  currency 
fluctuations.  Moreover,  mature  and  well  developed  financial  markets  in  these  countries,  have 
absorbed  the  risk  associated  with  exchange  rate  fluctuations  with  negligible  spillover  on  the  real 
activity. On the other hand, for the majority of developing countries which specialise in labour-intensive 
and low and intermediate technology products, profit margins in the intensely competitive markets for 
these  products  are  very  thin  and  vulnerable  to  pricing  power  by  large  retail  chains.  Consequently, 
exchange rate volatility has significant employment, output and distributional consequences (Mohan, 
2004a;  2005).  In  this  context,  managing  exchange  rate  volatility  would  continue  to  be  an  issue 
requiring attention.  
A further challenge for policy in the context of fuller capital account opennes will be to preserve the 
financial stability of different markets as greater deregulation is done on capital outflows and on debt 
inflows.  The  vulnerability  of  financial  intermediaries  can  perhaps  be  addressed  through  prudential 
regulations  and  their  supervision;  risk  management  of  non-financial  entities  will  have  to  be  through 
further developments in both the corporate debt market and the forex market, which enable them to 
manage  their  risks  through  the  use  of  newer  market  instruments.  This  will  require  market 
development,  enhancement  of  regulatory  capacity  in  these  areas,  as  well  as  human  resource 
development in both financial intermediaries and non-financial entities. Given the volatility of capital 
flows, it remains to be seen whether financial market development in a country like India can be such 
that  this  volatility  does  not  result  in  unacceptable  disruption  in  exchange  rate  determination  with 
inevitable real sector consequences, and in domestic monetary conditions. If not, what will be the kind 
of market interventions that will continue to be needed and how effective will they be? 
Another aspect of greater capital market openness concerns the presence of foreign banks in India. 
The  Government  and  Reserve  Bank  outlined  a  roadmap  on  foreign  investment  in  banks  in  India  in 
February 2005, which provides guidelines on the extent of their presence until 2009. This roadmap is 
consistent with the overall guidelines issued simultaneously on ownership and governance in private 
sector banks in India. The presence of foreign banks in the country has been very useful in bringing 
greater competition in certain segments in the market. They are significant participants in investment 
banking and in development of the forex market. With the changes that have taken place in the United 
States and other countries, where the traditional barriers between banking, insurance and securities 
companies have been removed, the size of the largest financial conglomerates has become extremely

large. Between 1995 and 2004, the size of the largest bank in the world has grown three-fold by asset 
size, from about US $ 0.5 trillion to US $ 1.5 trillion, almost double the size of Indian GDP. This has 
happened through a great degree of merger activity: for example, J.P.Morgan Chase is the result of 
mergers among 550 banks and financial institutions. The ten biggest commercial banks in the US now 
control almost half of that country's banking assets, up from 29 per cent just 10 years ago (Economist, 
2006). Hence, with fuller capital account convertibility and greater presence of foreign banks over time, 
a  number  of  issues  will  arise.  First,  if  these  large  global  banks  have  emerged  as  a  result  of  real 
economies of scale and scope, how will smaller national banks compete in countries like India, and will 
they  themselves  need  to  generate  a  larger  international  presence?  Second,  there  is  considerable 
discussion today on overlaps and potential conflicts between home country regulators of foreign banks 
and host country regulators: how will these be addressed and resolved in the years to come? Third, 
given that operations in one country such as India are typically small relative to the global operations 
of these large banks, the attention of top management devoted to any particular country is typically 
low. Consequently, any market or regulatory transgressions committed in one country by such a bank, 
which may have a significant impact on banking or financial market of that country, is likely to have 
negligible impact on the bank's global operations. It has been seen in recent years that even relatively 
strong regulatory action taken by regulators against such global banks has had negligible market or 
reputational  impact  on  them  in  terms  of  their  stock  price  or  similar  metrics.  Thus,  there  is  loss  of 
regulatory effectiveness as a result of the presence of such financial conglomerates. Hence there is 
inevitable tension between the benefits that such global conglomerates bring and some regulatory and 
market structure and competition issues that may arise.  
Along  with  the  emergence  of  international  financial  conglomerates  we  are  also  witnessing  similar 
growth  of  Indian  conglomerates.  As  in  most  countries,  the  banking,  insurance  and  securities 
companies  each  come  under  the  jurisdiction  of  their  respective  regulators.  A  beginning  has  been 
made in organized cooperation between the regulators on the regulation of such conglomerates, with 
agreement  on  who  would  be  the  lead  regulator  in  each  case.  In  the  United  States,  it  is  a  financial 
holding company that is at the core of each conglomerate, with each company being its subsidiary. 
There is, as yet, no commonality in the financial structure of each conglomerate in India: in some the 
parent  company  is  the  banking  company;  whereas  in  others  there  is  a  mix  of  structure.  For  Indian 
conglomerates to be competitive, and for them to grow to a semblance of international size, they will 
need continued improvement in clarity in regulatory approach. 
As  the  country's  financial  system  faces  each  of  these  challenges  in  the  coming  years,  we  will  also 
need to adapt monetary policy to the imperatives brought by higher growth and greater openness of 
the economy.  
High credit growth and monetary policy 
High and sustained growth of the economy in conjunction with low inflation is the central concern of 
monetary  policy  in  India.  As  noted  above,  we  have  been  reasonably  successful  in  meeting  these 
objectives.  In  this  context,  one  issue  still  remains:  whether  monetary  policy  should  have  only  price 
stability as its sole objective, as suggested by proponents of inflation targeting. Several central banks, 
such as, Bank of Canada, Bank of England, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, have adopted 
explicit inflation targets. Others, whose credibility in fighting inflation is long established (notably, the 
US Federal Reserve), do not set explicit annual inflation targets. Central banks are thus clearly divided 
on  the  advisability  of  setting  explicit  inflation  targets.  In  view  of  the  difficulties  encountered  with 
monetary targeting and exchange rate pegged regimes, a number of central banks including some in 
emerging economies have adopted inflation targeting frameworks.3  
The simple principle of inflation targeting thus is also not so simple and poses problems for monetary 
policy making in developing countries. Moreover, concentrating only on numerical inflation objectives 
may reduce the flexibility of monetary policy, especially with respect to other policy goals, particularly 
that of growth. 
In India, we have not favoured the adoption of inflation targeting, while keeping the attainment of low 
inflation as a central objective of monetary policy, along with that of high and sustained growth that is 
so important for a developing economy. Apart from the legitimate concern regarding growth as a key 
                                                      
3   Although these inflation targeting countries were able to reduce inflation or maintain low inflation during the 1990s, stylised 
evidence shows that even non-IT countries were successful in this endeavour.

objective, there are other factors that suggest that inflation targeting may not be appropriate for India. 
First, unlike many other developing countries we have had a record of moderate inflation, with double 
digit  inflation  being  the  exception,  and  which  is  largely  socially  unacceptable.  Second,  adoption  of 
inflation targeting requires the existence of an efficient monetary transmission mechanism through the 
operation of efficient financial markets and absence of interest rate distortions. In India, although the 
money market, government debt and forex market have indeed developed in recent years, they still 
have  some  way  to  go,  whereas  the  corporate  debt  market  is  still  to  develop.  Though  interest  rate 
deregulation  has  largely  been  accomplished,  some  administered  interest  rates  still  persist.  Third, 
inflationary  pressures  still  often  emanate  from  significant  supply  shocks  related  to  the  effect  of  the 
monsoon on agriculture, where monetary policy action may have little role. Finally, in an economy as 
large  as  that  of  India,  with  various  regional  differences,  and  continued  existence  of  market 
imperfections in factor and product markets between regions, the choice of a universally acceptable 
measure of inflation is also difficult.  
A contemporary issue in central banking is the appropriate response of monetary policy to sharp asset 
price  movements,  that  may  accompany  high  corporate  growth.  In  an  era  of  price  stability  and  well-
anchored inflation expectations, imbalances in the economy need not show up immediately in overt 
inflation.  Increased  central  bank  credibility  is  a  double-edged  sword  as  it  makes  it  more  likely  that 
unsustainable booms could take longer to show up in overt inflation. For instance, unsustainable asset 
prices  artificially  boost  accounting  profits  of  corporates  and  thereby  mitigate  the  need  for  price 
increases; similarly, large financial gains by employees can partly substitute for higher wage claims. In 
an  upturn  of  the  business  cycle,  self-reinforcing  processes  develop,  characterised  by  rising  asset 
prices  and  loosening  external  financial  constraints.  'Irrational  exuberance'  can  drive  asset  prices  to 
unrealistic  levels,  even  as  the  prices  of  currently  traded  goods  and  services  exhibit  few  signs  of 
inflation (Crockett, 2001). These forces operate in reverse in the contraction phase. In the upswing of 
the business cycle, financial imbalances, therefore, get built-up. There is, thus, a 'paradox of credibility' 
(Borio and White, 2003). In view of these developments, it is felt that credit and monetary aggregates 
– which are being ignored by many central banks in view of the perceived instability of money demand 
- need to be monitored closely since sharp growth in these aggregates is a useful indicator of future 
instability.  
In India, like other countries, we have also seen large rallies in asset prices. Concomitantly, credit to 
the private sector has exhibited sharp growth in the past two years – averaging almost 30 per cent per 
annum. While the credit growth has been broad-based, credit to the retail sector is emerging as a new 
avenue of deployment for the banking sector led by individual housing loans. To illustrate, the share of 
housing  in  incremental  bank  credit  has  increased  from  2.9  per  cent  in  1995-96  to  11.1  per  cent  in 
2004-05,  while  the  share  of  industry  went  down  from  64.9  per  cent  in  1995-96  to  25.6  per  cent  in 
2004-05.4 Data for retail credit is not available prior to 1998-99; its share too has increased from 19.4 
per cent in 1998-99 to 24.3 per cent in 2004-05. 
Nonetheless,  in  the  light  of  high  credit  growth,  there  is  a  need  to  ensure  that  asset  quality  is 
maintained. Since growth in credit was relatively higher in a few sectors such as retail credit and real 
commercial estate, monetary policy faces a dilemma in terms of instruments. An increase in policy rate 
across the board could adversely affect even the productive sectors of the economy such as industry 
and agriculture. While policy rates have indeed been raised, they have been mainly aimed at reining in 
inflation expectations in view of continuing pressures from high and volatile crude oil prices. Therefore, 
while ensuring that credit demand for the productive sectors of the economy is met, the Reserve Bank 
has  resorted  to  prudential  measures  in  order  to  engineer  a  ‘calibrated’  deceleration  in  the  overall 
growth of credit to the commercial sector. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has raised risk weights on 
loans to these sectors. It also more than doubled provisioning requirements on standard loans for the 
specific sectors from 0.4 per cent to 1.0 per cent. Thus, the basic objective has been to ensure that the 
growth process is facilitated while ensuring price and financial stability in the economy.  
It is in this context, and consistent with the multiple indicator approach adopted by the Reserve Bank, 
that monetary policy in India has consistently emphasised the need to be watchful about indications of 
rising  aggregate  demand  embedded  in  consumer  and  business  confidence,  asset  prices,  corporate 
performance, the sizeable growth of reserve money and money supply, the rising trade and current 
account  deficits  and,  in  particular,  the  quality  of  credit  growth.  In  retrospect,  this  risk  sensitive

approach has served us well in containing aggregate demand pressures and second round effects to 
an extent. It has also ensured that constant vigil is maintained on threats to financial stability through a 
period when inflation was on the upturn and asset prices, especially in housing and real estate, are 
emerging  as  a  challenge  to  monetary  authorities  worldwide.  Significantly,  it  has  also  reinforced  the 
growth  momentum  in  the  economy.  It  is  noteworthy  that  the  cyclical  expansion  in  bank  credit  has 
extended over an unprecedented 30 months without encountering any destabilising volatility but this 
situation warrants enhanced vigilance. 
Concluding observations 
V.  
To  conclude,  the  financial  system  in  India,  through  a  measured,  gradual,  cautious,  and  steady 
process,  has  undergone  substantial  transformation.  It  has  been  transformed  into  a  reasonably 
sophisticated, diverse and resilient system through well-sequenced and coordinated policy measures 
aimed  at  making  the  Indian  financial  sector  more  competitive,  efficient,  and  stable.  Concomitantly, 
effective  monetary  management  has  enabled  price  stability  while  ensuring  availability  of  credit  to 
support investment demand and growth in the economy. Finally, the multi-pronged approach towards 
managing  capital  account  in  conjunction  with  prudential  and  cautious  approach  to  financial 
liberalisation  has  ensured  financial  stability  in  contrast  to  the  experience  of  many  developing  and 
emerging economies. This is despite the fact that we faced a large number of shocks, both global and 
domestic.  Monetary  policy  and  financial  sector  reforms  in  India  had  to  be  fine  tuned  to  meet  the 
challenges emanating from all these shocks. Viewed in this light, the success in maintaining price and 
financial stability is all the more creditworthy. 
As the economy ascends a higher growth path, and as it is subjected to greater opening and financial 
integration with the rest of the world, the financial sector in all its aspects will need further considerable 
development,  along  with  corresponding  measures  to  continue  regulatory  modernization  and 
strengthening.  The  overall  objective  of  maintaining  price  stability  in  the  context  of  economic  growth 
and financial stability will remain.
