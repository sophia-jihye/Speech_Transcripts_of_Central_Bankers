Peter Tari: Overview of the Vanuatu economic performance 
Presentation by Mr Peter Tari, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu, at the Reserve Bank 
of Vanuatu, Port Vila, 7 June 2006. 
 Overview and performance 
• 
Vanuatu’s economic performance has been affected by a number of factors, including the 
smallness  and  isolations  of  the  islands,  globalizations  and  gradual  loss  of  preferential 
markets, natural calamities, lack of capacity and political instability. 
Vanuatu is made up of some 80 mostly volcanic islands that extend approximately 1,176km 
in  a  north-south  direction.  The  total  land  area  is  12,281.25  Km²  and  the  current  crude 
population density is estimated at 17 persons per Km². The country’s population growth rate 
is  2.6  percent  per  annum  and  a  real  GDP  per  capita  estimated  at  USD718  in  2004.  The 
current population is estimated to be around 240,000, of which 80% are said to be living in 
rural areas and are engaging agriculture. 
Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, and it makes up approximately 70 percent of the 
country’s exports. Despite the fact that agriculture supports the bulk of the population, it is 
not the leading contributor to GDP. In the last six years agriculture make up on average 18.3 
percent of GDP. The services sector dominates the economy, accounting for around 73% of 
total  GDP  followed  by  the  agriculture.  Within  the  services  sector,  the  wholesale  and  retail 
sector  dominates  with  around  40%.  Tourism,  which  makes  up  around  16%  of  GDP,  is 
becoming  an  important  sector  of  the  economy  generating  around  75%  of  the  total  foreign 
exchange earned by the country. 
Economic  growth  since  independence  in  1980  has  been  erratic.  The  fluctuating  trend  in 
Vanuatu’s economic growth was caused by a number of factors including political instability, 
the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters and changing international prices for Vanuatu’s 
exports, and a whole of other factors. 
The  last  five  years  also  saw  marked  variations  in  growth.  After  two  successive  years  of 
contraction in 2001 and 2002, real GDP rebounded in 2003 and has since been recording 
positive  growth.  Growth  in  2003  and  2004  ranged  from  4-5%  and  has  been  driven  by 
Agriculture and Services sectors. Positive real GDP growth continued in 2005 but at lower 
magnitude  compared  the  preceding  two  years.  In  2005,  the  services  and  industry  sectors 
continue  to  grow  therefore  more  than  offset  a  negative  contribution  from  the  Agriculture 
sector.  The  services  sector  grew  by  4.7  percent  in  2005,  with  much  of  the  growth  being 
attributed  to  growth  in  transport  and  communication  by  12.1  percent  and  in  Finance  and 
Insurance by 16.3 percent. 
The Agriculture sector declined in 2005 after experiencing growth for 2003 and 2004. The 
downturn in Agriculture is driven by copra which in turn was caused by a drop in copra prices 
which had an effect on production. Cocoa also indicated a decline in 2005, mainly due to a 
drop in export prices. Kava also experienced a decline in 2005, following a temporary ban in 
Fiji for Vanuatu kava. This lower decline in agriculture output continues towards the first half 
of 2006 but is expected to improve towards the end of the year. 
On the fiscal front, the Government has for the past few years achieved fiscal consolidation. 
Much of the improvement has been attributed to improving economic conditions and inflows 
of  donor  funds  but  also  to  good  control  measures  over  expenditures.  Reflecting  the  good 
outturn in fiscal operations the Government managed to retire some of its domestic debts in 
2005.  Also  the  Government  is  no  longer  heavily  dependent  on  the  overdraft  facility  at  the 
Reserve Bank of Vanuatu given its improve fiscal management. 
The  Reserve  Bank  makes  regular  assessment  of  the  economy  and  adjusts  its  monetary 
policy stance accordingly. Last year in June 2005, the Bank, following its regular assessment 
of the economy was satisfied that macroeconomic stability has been achieved and that the 
macroeconomic variables that it monitors against its policy settings have improved. Based 
on this assessment it relaxed its monetary policy stance by reducing its rediscount rate from

6.5 to 6.25 percent. On 15th March 2006 the Bank further relaxed its monetary policy stance 
by reducing its official interest rate from 6.25 percent to 6.00 percent. 
Challenges for Vanuatu

4. 
5. 
Continue to maintaining macroeconomic stability in order to promote growth; 
Promoting private sector development as an engine of growth; 
Political Stability has to be maintained for a conducive investment climate; 
Raising investments by removing impediments 
Promoting  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  so  that  economic  growth  is  more  balanced  and 
broad based; 
The  private  sector  development  is  more  challenged  because  of  good  governance  issues, 
unpredictable policy environment, poor infrastructure and the need for improvement of law and order. 
Outlook 
• 
 The current favorable performance of the economy is expected to continue in 2006 and for 
the next two years. In 2006, the economy has been forecasted to grow by 3.9 percent and by 
4.3 percent during 2007. The services sector is expected to continue to drive the economy 
forward  but  also  the  industry  sector  is  expected  to  contribute  favorably  if  the  Millennium 
Challenge  Account  projects  are  implemented.  The  agriculture  sector  is  also  anticipated  to 
improve in 2006. 
The  Balance  of  Payment  of  the  country  outlook  appears  favorable.  Official  international 
reserves have increased to a comfortable level of 6 months of import cover in May 2006, and 
are expected to continue to increase in 2006.
