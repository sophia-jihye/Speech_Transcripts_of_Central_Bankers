José De Gregorio: The tensions of the world economy 
Speech  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  at  the  Seminar 
organized  by  students  of  the  School  of  Business  Administration  of  Pontificia  Universidad 
Católica de Chile, and in the Manufacturers Association SOFOFA, Santiago, 24 September 
2008. 
I am thankful to Kevin Cowan, Pablo García and Andrea Tokman for valuable comments.

A natural thing to do is to program these presentations some time in advance, not being fully 
aware of the conditions we will be facing when the time comes. Needless to say, over the 
past few days I have had to edit many developments into my lecture, as the world economy 
is making history. 
Thinking of the global economy’s present situation leads us to focus almost exclusively on 
the financial crisis, but this is one aspect of more generalized problems and imbalances that 
have build up over the years. The global economy is going through a severe financial crisis, 
high inflation and unusual dispersion of growth around the world. Furthermore, this scenario 
is very uncertain, as we have stated in our last Monetary Policy Report. 
Today  I  would  like  to  address  the  current  situation  from  a  broader  perspective,  not  only 
analyzing  the  financial  crisis  but  digging  more  deeply  into  how  we  got  to  the  present 
scenario,  exploring  its  economic  policy  implications  and  finding  the  lessons  to  be  learned 
from it. For a short presentation this could be too ambitious, so I will have to leave out some 
parts  of  the  story.  I  will  concentrate  in  some  issues  that  I  believe  are  essential  for 
understanding the present state of affairs: global imbalances, the financial crisis, emerging 
economies’  growth  and  globalization,  with 
inflationary  effects  and  “decoupling” 
phenomenon.  I  will  continue  with  some  policy  lessons  and  implications  on  the  Chilean 
economy. 
But first allow me to make some reflections on economic policy.  
Entrepreneurial  success  and  failure  are  inherent  to  market  economies.  This  is also  true  in 
financial entities. We know that in the corporate world rotation is high, with firms coming in 
and  going  out,  and  jobs  being  created  and  destroyed.  This  is  at  the  cornerstone  of 
Schumpeter’s  destructive  creation,  and  explains  a  substantial  part  of  progress  and 
productivity growth. However, there are negative externalities. Miscoordination and contagion 
problems,  especially  in  the  financial  system,  have  the  potential  to  amplify  the  cycles  and 
transform destructive creation into destructive destruction.  
A  financial  institution  in  distress  does  not  make  the  headlines,  but  when  complications 
become  systemic,  the  consequences  can  be  very  disturbing.  It  is  thus  crucial  to  prevent 
problems  in  one  specific  sector  from  spreading  across  the  whole  economy,  with  costly 
consequences. Hence the importance of safeguarding the economy’s financial stability.  
Until a while ago, when I was asked to speak about financial stability I normally discussed 
evidence from developing economies. We have learned than exchange-rate crises are costly 
per  se,  but  if  accompanied  by  a  financial  breakdown  the  cost  duplicates.  Similarly,  an 
economic slowdown cum banking crisis has severe effects on output and employment. But 
today we need not resort to those stories. The US has been accumulating a current-account 
deficit for quite some time that sooner or later would have to be corrected via deceleration 
and depreciation. But the financial crises that got in the picture will make adjustments much 
more expensive.

Global imbalances  
By the late 1990s, the US current account deficit began to soar: From 140 billion dollars in 
1997 – equivalent to 1.7% of GDP –  it climbed to 739 billion dollars in 2007, that is, 5.3% of 
GDP (figure 1).  
A first glance at the data requires screening the regional savings and investment balances to 
see how current-account deficits are distributed around the world. What we see is a dramatic 
fall in savings – both private and public – in the United States, but also a major increase in 
surpluses in Asia. This reflects increased savings in China, but also a post-crisis dramatic 
reduction in investment in the rest of Asia.1 The recession of 2001 brought a slight relapse, 
but  growth  resumed  briefly.  Fiscal  policy  was  of  little  help,  although  the  fact  that  the 
international interest rate was so low – as opposed to the mid-1980s' twin deficits experience 
–  is  an  indication  that  the  cause  of  the  deficit  was  not  the  drop  in  US  saving  ,  but  rather 
Asia’s surplus. Later on, this increase in Asia’s net saving combined with significant terms of 
trade gains (figure 2). Thus, there was a large amount of funds looking for a place to invest. 
The United States had the capacity to produce profitable securities to absorb said savings 
(Caballero et al., 2008).  
A different version of this story was that the deficit was simply mis-measured, owing to its 
many non-observable components, which led analysts to mistake foreign funding for foreign 
income (Hausmann & Sturzenegger, 2006). This is the case, for example, of seniorage.  
Both stories help explain why the current-account deficit can persist in high levels for longer 
than usual. But domestic factors also played a part in the US. expansionary monetary and 
fiscal policies while a real-estate bubble was building up, put additional weight on the fall in 
savings.  
The  main  question  was  if  this  process  could  be  sustained,  and  the  more  benign  visions 
thought  it  could  last  a  long  time.  But  the  accumulation  of  imbalances  at  least  had  to 
moderate,  which  indicated  that  the  dollar  would  weaken  and  output  would  slow  down.  
Calculations performed a few years back indicate that a dollar depreciation of around 40% 
was  necessary  to  reduce  the  current-account  deficit  by  3  percentage  points  of  GDP.2 
According to estimates by Freund and Warnock (2007), such an adjustment would cause a 
GDP slowdown of around half a percentage point, much less than a financial crisis. 
On the other hand, and as has been made apparent by the financial crisis, the world lent to 
the US, to a large extent to finance overvalued houses that were sold to families that could 
not afford them. Now we see confirmation that such an expansion was not a healthy one.   
Real-estate boom and financial crisis 
For several years, housing prices spiraled up in a number of developed economies (figure 3). 
There  were  lengthy  debates  whether  a  bubble  was  forming,  that  is,  if  prices  were  beyond 
what  could  be  warranted  by  fundamentals  (housing  services  provided  by  homes).  For 
example, the World Economic Outlook of September 2004 (Terrones, 2004), analyzed what 
could  happen  if  interest  rates  increased.  This  was  three  years  before  the  collapse,  which 
occurred  within  the  context  of  a  mild  increase  in  US  interest  rates.  First  were  subprime 
mortgages  and  banking  losses,  then  the  monoliners  and  Bear  Sterns  followed  suit,  as  did 
mortgage  credit  providers  (Freddie  Mac  and  Fannie  Mae),  insurance  companies,  other 
                                                           
1   This is Bernanke (2005)’s well-known saving glut, although it seems to apply mainly to China, because the fall 
in investment dominated in the rest of Asia (Laxton and Milesi-Ferretti, 2005).  
2   See De Gregorio (2007). The depreciation would be larger if it did not consider that, as the US liabilities are in 
dollars,  the  depreciation  reduces  its  debt  (valuation  effect;  see,  for  example,  Gorurinchas  and  Rey,  2007). 
Calculations are similar to those in Obstfeld and Rogoff (2007).

investment  banks,  and  so  on.  A  problem  that  began  with  subprime  mortgage  loan 
delinquency has spread to the whole real-estate market (figure 4). 
In analyzing the problem of housing prices, the first thing we should recognize is that in a first 
approach,  housing  price  fluctuations  should  not  result  in  significant  fluctuations  in 
consumption. A rise in the price of the home increases the household’s asset value, but also 
increases  the  cost  of  living  in  it,  so  the  net  result  should  not  be  any  material  change  in 
consumptions of goods different from housing.3 Therefore, a first effect of a real-estate crisis 
should be a drop in the construction sector, not a drastic fall in consumption. Nevertheless, 
there are a number of factors that help explain the increased sensitivity of consumption and 
output to housing prices, and top of the list is transmission via the financial system. When the 
higher value of the homes is not capitalized by the owners but is mortgaged in a fast, fragile 
credit expansion, the ensuing contraction can be extremely severe, as we can see now.    
Despite  the  severity  of  the  present  crisis,  so  far  its  effects  have  been  reined  in  by  strong 
policy decisions oriented at warding off a financial implosion.  
The immediate policy reaction when the crisis was unleashed was the provision of liquidity 
and an aggressive cut to the fed funds interest rate in the US (figure 5). New credit facilities 
were  designed  and  huge  amounts  of  liquidity  were  injected,  but  tensions  in  monetary 
markets persist. (figure 6). Even if liquidity abounds, it does not move from those who have it 
in excess to those in demand, because of the great uncertainty that exists and the decision 
of  financial  entities  to  hold  on  to  their  liquidity  surpluses  to  cushion  themselves  against 
balance-sheet  shocks  (Allen  and  Carletti,  2008)  or  simply  to  benefit  from  buying  assets  at 
discount prices.  
The financial crisis is the outcome of two key phenomena. On one side is a period of stability, 
low interest rates, abundant liquidity, fast economic growth and an asset price bubble (figure 
7). This combination of aggregate factors gives way, as often occurs, to a phase of fast credit 
expansion. Actually, a financial crisis is much more likely to owe to a credit expansion, but 
not every credit boom ends up in a crisis4. At the same time, many countries have recorded 
a  real-estate  boom,  but  not  all  of  them  have  found  themselves  in  the  extreme  financial 
system breakdown as the United States. The problem is that this has occurred within a spiral 
of financial innovation in very poorly regulated market segments. One important task will be 
to figure out why the financial systems of different economies with similar credit growth rates 
and housing price behaviors have had so different outcomes. 
The low interest rates prompted a search for better returns. Individuals with zero repayment 
capacity were provided loans, and to reduce the risk, said loans were securitized and often 
taken out of the banks' balance sheets (i.e. structured investment vehicles and conduits), so 
no  further  capital  requirements  were  necessary  for  the  banks.  Credits  were  issued  on  the 
basis of ever-increasing housing prices, so the mortgage was backing enough to relax the 
lending standards. As often occurs when the storm hits, the situation reversed and a credit 
contraction followed (figure 8). Also, the real-estate bubble created a demand for homes as 
financial assets. 
These  loans  were  sold  to  agents  that  neglected  the  risk  evaluation  process,  hence  the 
contamination to the whole financial system.  The "originate and distribute" model crashed, 
risk-rating  institutions  were  unable  to  properly  rate  complex  securities,  while  the  executive 
compensation structure also encouraged the search for returns. 
Lending to risky borrowers that fail to repay is certainly costly, but it can hardly unleash a 
crisis  of  the  magnitude  we  are  seeing  today.  The  problem  is  aggravated  by  the  way  the 
                                                           
3   This  point  has  been  made  more  intensively  in  Buiter  (2008).  For  a  vision  involving  other  mechanisms,  see 
Muellbauer (2007).

banks  got  rid  of  these  loans,  how  they  were  rated,  the  derivatives  that  were  created  to 
reduce the risk and pretend they had been transferred away. There are also doubts whether 
the  derivatives  markets'  operation  was  as  transparent  as  it  should  have  been  or  if  it  was 
manipulated.  The  paradox  of  the  present  scenario  is  that  the  banking  system,  whose 
objectives should be to intermediate credits and hedge against risks, seemingly concealed 
the  risks  in  a  complex  web  of  derivatives  (and  notes)  thanks  to  regulations  that  didn't 
measure up to the challenge. 
Another aggravating circumstance is the transition of the bank-based financial system to a 
system based on tradable, short-run-debt certificates. This scheme opens the door to a bank 
run that differs from the old ones where customers stood in line to withdraw their deposits. 
The  recent  incorporation  of  safety-net  policies  for  institutions  (Primary  Dealer  Lending  and 
bankarization  of  investment  banks)  and  securities  (guarantees  to  Money  Market  Mutual 
Funds), are the offspring of this change in the financial system. The lessons learned in the 
1920s, which led to the creation of the Fed is being "relearned" now. It is worth recalling that 
before the Fed came to life, the United States endured a major banking system crisis every 
three years (Gorton, 1988). 
World inflation and growth 
China’s  sustained  growth  for  many  years  already  has  been  at  the  core  of  the  world 
economy’s  evolution.  The  Chinese  incorporation  to  the  global  world  was  great  news, 
because  it  brought  with  it  economic  growth  and  low  prices.  The  continuous  migration  of 
millions of people from the countryside to the city boosted world output. They not only could 
produce  at  lower  prices  but  they  also  were  the  cause  of  the  increase  in  savings  in  that 
country. 
China is maybe the most emblematic example, but growth has been present in the majority 
of emerging economies, in particular in Asia and Latin America.  
One  of  the  reasons  why  in  the  ten  years  before  2006  inflation  was  low,  especially  in 
developed  economies,  was  the  supply  of  goods  from  emerging  markets.5  Inflation  is 
dependent on the monetary policy decisions and in the extreme, under total inflation control, 
it could be pegged to the target regardless of the import prices of imports or other factors. 
However, what globalization permitted was a period of low inflation and high growth (table 1). 
There  was  a  change  in  relative  prices,  with  a  significant  drop  in  prices  of  goods  from 
emerging  economies  going  global  and,  as  we  see  today,  with  an  increase  in  the  relative 
prices of foodstuff and energy. 
It  can  be  said,  then,  that  globalization  was  a  productivity  shock  that  allowed  for  transitory 
reductions  in  inflation.  However,  the  phenomenon  could  not  last  forever,  and  is  now 
reversing. 
The  accelerated  growth  of  the  past  several  years  finally  showed  on  prices.  This  can  be 
interpreted as we would analyze inflation in just any country. When potential GDP grows fast, 
inflation remains constant or may even fall. However, if actual GDP growth runs above its 
potential or trend, price pressures result. The world economy grew fast, and although China 
contributed  to  world  potential  output  growth,  inflationary  pressures  have  emerged  in  those 
sectors  where  the  demand  grew  faster  than  supply,  namely  oil  and  foods  (figure  9). 
Inexpensive  goods  can  still  be  produced,  if  capacity  expands  without  generating  price 
pressures.  But  the  demand  for  oil,  steel,  minerals,  etc.,  recorded  strong  increases,  which 
pushed prices up. The supply has not responded to demand with the same vigor. 
                                                           
5   The empirical literature has been critical in this point, but a recent work by Auer and Fischer (2008) shows that 
the  producer  price  index  of  the  United  States  was  two  percentage  points  less  due  to  cheap  imports  from 
developing economies.

A  case  worth  highlighting  is  foods.  Some  of  them  absorbed  the  demand  increase  due  to 
economic  growth  with  supply  increases,  but  then  a  new  source  of  demand  appeared:  bio 
fuels, which have further strained the prices of grains. 
Another factor that, according to some analysts, has been important in price hikes has been 
investor  involvement,  demanding  commodities  as  another  asset  in  their  portfolios.  But  if 
investors  were  buying  to  resell  with  a  margin,  this  would  translate  into  an  increase  in 
inventories, which it has not. 
Accordingly,  the  purchases  of  futures  by  some  agents  go  hand  in  hand  with  the  sale  of 
futures  by  others,  and  are  normally  the  counterpart  of  hedging  operations.  On  the  other 
hand, while investors’ positions have risen substantially in the commodities markets, they still 
share but a small fraction of the market. Overall, one cannot rule out that investors’ buy and 
sell strategies will have an effect on the high short-run volatility of prices, but it is difficult to 
blame on them the high and persistent levels we see today. 
The worst nightmare in terms of high inflation and  low output has been the price of oil, which 
has broken all the records. After standing at US$12 per barrel in 1999 as a consequence of 
the  Asian  crisis,  it  started  climbing  throughout  the  2000s  in  tandem  with  world  growth.  By 
mid-2006, when the oil price was approaching US$70 per barrel, the question was why the 
world economy was so insensitive to it. Researchers tried to explain why such a heavy price 
increase had been so mild on inflation and output (De Gregorio et al., 2007; Blanchard and 
Galí, 2007). Fingers pointed at the usual suspects: good monetary policies and less intensive 
use of oil around the world. 
In  sum,  the  world  economy  was  more  insensitive  to  the  oil  price.  However,  if  oil  demand 
continued to rise without a corresponding increase in supply, a large enough price rise was 
necessary to begin having an effect on the demand. The levels of a couple of years ago were 
not enough to restrain the demand, and precisely because of that, researchers found little 
effects from the shock on output and inflation. Only when the price went beyond US$100 per 
barrel did it truly begin to affect the demand, and from then on the reduced output prospects 
have continued to determine its price.  
Inflation-wise,  the  international  scenario  is  still  delicate.  After  a  shock  of  oil  and  foodstuff 
prices  that  had  no  parallel  since  the  Great  Inflation  of  the  1970s,  inflation  has  risen 
everywhere  (figure  10).  Also,  inflation  expectations  have  increased  accordingly  (figures  11 
and 12). In general terms, it has not yet become a generalized inflationary phenomenon but, 
inasmuch as it is transmitted to expectations and wages, it can be very persistent.  
Monetary policy reactions to this phenomenon have been varied. In developed economies, 
where growth prospects are frail, interest rates have been lowered (figure 13). In general, the 
slowdown  is  expected  to  be  sufficient  to  bring  down  high  inflation.  On  the  contrary,  in 
developing economies monetary policy has been on average restrictive. Growth rates are still 
reasonable, so one cannot rely on a drop in inflation without having to raise the interest rate. 
World  growth  is  still  strong.  (figure  14).  What  is  new  is  the  decoupling  of  developed 
economies with the rest of the world. Not surprisingly, the entire world is decelerating, but the 
degree of expansion of output varies significantly. Never in the last half century did we see a 
period of such decoupling. The phenomenon is not exclusive to China, and has been present 
for several years already. The main doubts are how long will it last – which depends on the 
true decoupling capacity that emerging economies will display – and how long will developed 
economies’  growth  hold.  Here,  accumulating  a  current  account  surplus  can  help.  For 
example,  the  high  levels  of  reserves  in  China  allow  financing  deficit  for  several  years  and 
thus  weather  the  turbulences  with  domestic  growth.  Still,  one  cannot  rule  out  a  prolonged 
period of weak activity in developed countries that ends up seriously deteriorating growth in 
emerging economies, particularly those specializing in goods demanded in the former. 
Globalization,  where  countries  sell  their  products  in  global  markets  rather  than  in  specific 
economies, certainly supports the aforementioned decoupling, but it also spreads the effects 
BIS Review 124/2008

of  financial  shocks  around  the  world.  We  have  seen  international  stock  exchanges 
plummeting, and risk premiums of emerging economies rising (figures 15 and 16). Also, large 
foreign exchange fluctuations have occurred, but this is good news, because the exchange 
rates are helping the adjustment (figure 17). Asset prices show no decoupling but, as we well 
know,  price  corrections  may  limit  the  adjustments  in  quantities.  The key  to  this  is  whether 
price  corrections  are  helping  to  avoid  fluctuations  in  output  or  are  being  conveyors  of  the 
problems.  
The  good  performance  of  emerging  economies  should  not  lead  to  unfounded  optimism  or 
vanity, because this is largely the result of sound macroeconomic policies, and in such we 
must persevere.  
Final remarks 
I will finish with four points. First I will review the harmful effects that the ongoing crisis will 
have on the future development of financial markets. Next I will discuss financial bubbles and 
booms  in  monetary  policymaking,  and  the  nature  of  the  present  crisis  and  possible 
consequences, to wrap up with the implications of the world growth scenario on the Chilean 
monetary policy. 
In the present turmoil, authorities have acted as lenders of last resort providing liquidity to 
ensure proper market functioning. Nonetheless, regarding financial bailouts two costs have 
to  be  balanced:  averting  a  financial  collapse  with  catastrophic  consequences  on  the  one 
hand, and the negative signals that come from said bailouts, on the other. Not only have the 
too-big-to-fail institutions been rescued, but also entities whose connections with the system 
are such that if they fail the whole financial system may be shaken.  
Troubled companies’ shareholders should not be bailed out, because it is important that risk 
evaluation is done more diligently in the future. Care must be taken in rescuing debtors of 
defaulted firms, because it may relax borrowing and repayment discipline, and punish good 
creditors by comparison. The tradeoff between these two objectives is clearly illustrated with 
the developments of the past week. Allowing the demise of Lehman Brothers was a sign that 
bailouts would not be up for grabs and even the downfall of a large investment bank would 
be accepted, but this may have accelerated the devastating chain of events that followed.  
Indeed, what is worrisome is that the dimensions of the crisis that follow the Lehman collapse 
were  no  anticipated  by  the  authorities.    With  the  benefits  of  hindsight,  it  would  have  been 
better to avoid the collapse, and its effects should have been foreseen by policymakers.  
The consequences of the financial crisis will spread past the financial system, as is already 
perceived  in  recent  discussions  on  privatization  of  earnings  and  socialization  of  losses. 
Hopefully this debate will soon focus on the important issues, but we must recognize that the 
excessive  aggressiveness  and  ambition  of  some  players  in  the  international  financial 
markets, the irresponsible behavior of operators unaware of what they were trading, and lax 
risk assessment and regulation, will penalize the innocent and the guilty alike.  
A sound, competitive financial system is essential for economic development. The incentive 
structure is key for its smooth operation. If no credit exists, only those owning the resources 
could invest or buy durables. The financial markets allow the anticipation of consumption and 
invest. But its stability must be safeguarded to ensure efficient credit allocation and proper 
risk management.  
One issue that has been discussed in monetary policy theory and practice is how to handle 
bubbles. The conventional view is that nothing can be done to prevent them; that they cannot 
be  detected,  that  they  must  be  a  cause  for  concern  only  to  the  extent  that  they  affect 
inflation, and that the only thing to do is to clean the mess after they burst.  
This crisis, however, shows that this view is painfully wrong. In fact, a financial bubble and 
even  a  credit  boom,  can  have  little  or  no  effect  on  inflation,  but  that  is  not  the  point.

 BIS Review 124/2008
Furthermore,  an  interest  rate  increase  is  probably  unable  to  burst  the  bubble.  But  an 
excessive  expansion  of  credit  in  the  context  of  financial  euphoria  jeopardizes  the  other 
objective of central banks: financial stability.  
One important lesson from the present crisis is that we cannot wait for the bubble to burst to 
correct its effects. This may have worked with the technological bubble of the early 2000s, 
but  the  real-estate  boom  is  proof  that  the  problem  can  be  worse.  The  way  to  deal  with 
financial  and  price  instability  is  different.  For  the  first,  the  focus  is  on  risk  regulation  and 
evaluation by the authorities. Detected vulnerabilities must be flagged and, if necessary, new 
regulations must be adopted. For price stability, there is monetary policy.  
It may well be the case that price stability and financial stability have different implications on 
interest rate management. The best example of this is the aggressive reduction of interest 
rates  adopted  by  the  Fed  this  year.  Interest  rate  cuts  were  necessary  to  alleviate  liquidity 
tensions  in  monetary  markets  and  ensure  the  sound  operation  of  the  payments  system. 
Failing to take these actions might have further exacerbated the financial crisis.  
However, conflicts of this kind are faced in extreme situations and this must be clear when 
making monetary policy decisions. Three decisions of the Central Bank of Chile to intervene 
the  foreign  exchange  market  during  this  decade  can  be  interpreted  as  decisions  under 
extreme circumstances. They were associated to severe stress in foreign exchange markets 
or to the need to strengthen the international liquidity position. To avoid conflicts with price 
stability,  the  intervention  that  was  begun  in  April  has  been  implemented  mechanically  and 
transparently in order to orient monetary policy in consistency with the required convergence 
of inflation to the target.  
It is hard to find a financial crisis as severe as this one since the Great Depression. Still, its 
real consequences are still much milder than those of other episodes, including of course the 
Great Depression and even the Great Inflation of the 1970s. We have learned two lessons 
from  these  occurrences  and  which  are  clearly  present  in  the  acts  and  statements  from 
central bankers around the world. One is that central banks are the lenders of last resort and 
must  supply  the  necessary  liquidity  so  that  financial  markets  can  operate,  even  in  critical 
times. The other is that inflation must be fought with determination and letting it settle down 
and stay in the economy is very costly. Different perceptions and assessments can alter the 
short-term  course  of  monetary  policy,  so  flexibility  and  realism  are  necessary  to  timely 
correct the route, and this has been happening around the world and in Chile in particular. 
But not only have we learned from past errors, like the need to have good economic policies; 
the  world  is  also  better.  The  progress  of  the  past  few  decades  in  technology,  flexibility, 
international  integration,  transparency  and  accountability,  among  other  factors,  make  this 
world a safer place. In Chile we have a policy framework that grants us a good position like 
no other before, to sail through troubled waters.  
Regarding the world economy, there are big risks. The Chilean inflationary problem stems 
from  international  price  rises,  although  recently  we  have  seen  the  harmful  effects  of 
propagation.  In  the  baseline  scenario,  the  world  will  post  strong  growth  in  coming  years, 
driven  to  a  large  extent  by  emerging  economies,  particularly  China  and  India.  One  cannot 
rule out a deeper and longer lasting slowdown of industrialized countries than assumed in 
the baseline projection. In a weaker economic scenario, commodity prices should decline. A 
drop  in  the  oil  price  would  come  as  a  relief  for  the  world  economy.  Also,  a  weaker  world 
economy could affect Chile’s GDP  growth directly. These forces would pull down inflation. 
However, the inflationary dynamics and the convergence of inflation to the target cannot be 
based on a weak world scenario. This is a possibility and, as we always do, we will act with 
sufficient  flexibility  and  realism  to  incorporate  international  developments  and  prospects  in 
the analysis that underlies our monetary policy decisions. In these moments, inflation risks 
and dynamics do not allow for excessive optimism.
