Svante Öberg: Sweden and the financial crisis   
Speech  by  Mr  Svante  Öberg,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  Carlson 
Investment Management, Stockholm, 20 January 2009. 
 Introduction 
When I began working at the Riksbank three years ago, I had not during the preceding eight 
years followed the development of the economy as closely as when I worked at the Ministry 
of Finance and the National Institute of Economic Research. I was advised by Staffan Viotti, 
who is a professor of financial economics and adviser to the Executive Board, to familiarise 
myself with the new financial instruments that had been developed in recent years. These 
were instruments that the banks used to convert loans into securities that could be sold on 
the financial markets. I attended a couple of conferences which clarified the advantages of 
the new instruments; for example that they spread the risks taken by the banks to a larger 
group of investors. There was really only one problem. Liquidity on the new markets could 
"dry up", that is, a situation could arise in which there were only sellers but no buyers, but this 
was  considered  to  be  a  hypothetical  problem.  I  also  asked  experts  at  these  conferences 
about the possible nature of the next financial crisis. A typical answer was that it would be 
triggered by an event outside the United States and that the hedge funds would be involved. 
Now  we  know  better.  The  crisis  was  triggered  in  the  United  States  on  the  market  for 
mortgages  to  households  with  a  poor  ability  to  pay,  what  are  known  as  subprime  loans. 
Hedge funds have played a limited role in the development of the crisis. Instead it is highly 
leveraged institutions that have been central to the sequence of events, where some of the 
lending has been outside of the banks’ balance sheets.  
My main messages today are that so far Sweden has been able to handle the problems that 
the  global  financial  crisis  has  caused  for  the  financial  system,  although  the  negative 
consequences for the Swedish economy will be considerable over the next two years. And 
that there is a need to reform the global financial system in order to reduce the likelihood of 
new financial crises.  
I  have  divided  my  speech  into  three  sections.  I  shall  begin  with  the  financial  crisis  in  an 
international perspective: the course of events, the causes of the crisis and the handling of 
the  crisis.  Then  I  shall  discuss  how  Sweden  has  been  affected  by  the  crisis:  Sweden's 
dependence  on  the  outside  world,  measures  to  counter  the  crisis  and  our  experience  of 
previous  financial  crises.  I  shall  conclude  with  a  section  on  the  current  economic  situation 
and  monetary  policy,  where  I  shall  comment  on  new  statistics  without  making  any  new 
assessment of monetary policy.  
The financial crisis in an international perspective 
Course of events – from increased spreads to bank failures 
Developments during the financial crisis can be illustrated in several ways, for example by 
using  the  so-called  TED-spreads1,  that  is,  the  difference  between  three-month  interbank 
rates and government security rates.  
                                                 
1   The TED spread is the difference between an interbank rate and a government bond rate. As the banks lend 
to  one  another  without  collateral  (that  is,  with  a  credit  risk)  in  the  interbank  market,  while  government

The first signs of problems emerged already at the beginning of 2007 when the interest rates 
of  certain  so-called  structured  products  with  links  to  the  US  housing  market  began  to 
increase.  They  fell  during  the  spring  but  rose  again  in  mid-June  2007  when  the  US 
investment  bank  Bear  Sterns  was  forced  to  liquidate  one  of  its  hedge  funds  due  to  major 
losses.  
But  it  was in  August  that  the  indications  of  an  approaching  financial crisis  became  clearer 
and the TED spreads increased significantly. One reason for this was that the French bank 
BNP Paribas announced that it had stopped withdrawals from three of its mutual funds. The 
lack  of  liquidity  in  certain  market  segments  with  financial  instruments  linked  to  the  US 
housing market had made it impossible to value the underlying assets. The banks began to 
protect  their  own  liquidity  and  were  unwilling  to  lend  to  each  other.  The  gap  between  the 
"uncertain" interbank rate and the safe government security rate increased. 
The degree of financial unease then varied during the course of the following year. The TED 
spreads peaked when the banks wanted to secure their liquidity ahead of the turn of the year 
2007-2008.  A  further  peak  was  reached  in  March  2008  when  Bear  Sterns  suspended 
payments, but things calmed down again after the Federal Reserve mediated the takeover of 
the bank by JP Morgan. 
In mid-September 2008, when Lehman Brothers was forced to file for bankruptcy protection, 
the financial unease became an acute financial crisis. The TED spreads were driven up to 
very  high  levels.  Many  banks,  institutions  and  funds  were  highly  exposed  to  Lehman 
Brothers.  Few  had  expected  that  such  an  important  bank  could  fail.  Previously  the  US 
authorities had let the shareholders take the consequences. Now the borrowers also had to 
take some of the losses. There was a great deal of concern that more players would end up 
in  a  similar  situation.  The  remaining  large  investment  banks  in  the  United  States  also 
disappeared as independent investment banks.  
The TED spreads have risen and varied during different periods of time in Sweden, too, but 
they have been lower than in the United States and the euro area.  
Causes of the crisis – mortgages, imbalances and inadequate supervision 
The factor that triggered the financial crisis was thus the problems on the US housing market 
and mortgage market. An important element behind the prolonged rise in US housing prices 
was the rapid growth of lending for house purchases to low-income households. Since the 
mid-1990s, politicians had been encouraging these households to own their own homes by 
setting  quantifiable  targets  for  how  much  lending  from  the  mortgage  institutions  should 
increase.2 Subprime loans had become increasingly common and many households bought 
houses in the belief that house prices would continue to rise. When prices on the saturated 
housing market then began to fall in 2007, many US households with subprime loans found 
themselves in a situation where they were too highly mortgaged in relation to their incomes, 
and the credit losses of the mortgage institutions consequently increased.  
The subprime loans are, however, not the only underlying cause of the crisis. One important 
cause is the imbalances in the global financial system that have built up over a long period of 
time.  The  years  2002  to  2006  were  marked  by  strong  growth  in  the  global  economy,  the 
expansion of credit, historically low interest rates and a dramatic rise in housing prices and 
other asset prices. The United States built up large deficits in its current account, which it 
could fund because other parts of the world, mainly China and the oil-producing countries, 
built up large surpluses in their current accounts.  
                                                                                                                                                      
securities  are  considered  to  have  no  credit  risk,  the  TED  spread  can  be  interpreted  as  a  measure  of  the 
uncertainty in the financial markets.

 BIS Review 7/2009
Another  cause  behind  the  crisis  is  the  structured  credit  products  which  form  part  of  the 
financial  innovation.  Subprime  loans  were  often  packaged  together  with  other  loans.  This 
resulted  in  complicated  financial  products  that  were  sold  on  by  the  banks  that  were 
responsible  for  granting  the  loans  to  other  banks  and  financial  agents.  The  products  were 
difficult to gain insight into and therefore often came to buyers who found it difficult to assess 
the risks they had purchased. When the credit losses increased there was uncertainty over 
where the losses would finally appear. This is in turn led to reluctance on the part of banks 
and other players to lend money to one another. The structured credit products were created 
to  make  the  management  of  credit  risks  more  efficient.  At  the  same  time,  they  in  practice 
contributed to building up the risks that have made the financial crisis so severe.  
There  have  also  been  problems  with  credit  rating  agencies  (such  as  Standard  &  Poor’s, 
Moody’s  and  Fitch).  These  agencies  used  similar  methods  for  evaluating  the  structured 
products as those used for ordinary bonds. Many investors assumed that the credit ratings 
covered all of the risks, despite the fact that they really only focussed on the credit risk and 
ignored the liquidity risk, which can often be substantial for structured products. This meant 
that the credit ratings often underestimated the risks to which investors were exposed. This 
has greatly undermined the credibility of the credit rating agencies and they have a tough job 
ahead of them to build up this confidence once again. 
The supervision of the financial markets has not been effective enough either. In the United 
States, responsibility for supervision is divided between a large number of authorities and in 
Europe  between  a  large  number  of  countries,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  take  the  overall 
approach required. Another problem has been that the causes of the crisis largely relate to 
macroeconomic  phenomena  such  as  the  development  of  housing  price  bubbles,  while 
supervision traditionally focuses on microeconomic issues such as how individual institutions 
manage their lending. Nor have the supervisors reacted to the fact that the banks have built 
up considerable risks alongside their balance sheets. These risks have then returned to the 
banks  via  lines  of  credit,  that  is,  earlier  loan  agreements  entered  into,  and  in  other  ways 
when the funding problems have increased. 
There  are  further  reasons  behind  the  crisis.  For  example,  the  regulations  for  the  financial 
markets  have  been  procyclical,  that  is  they  have  tended  to  reinforce  cyclical  fluctuations. 
There has also been a rewards structure among the private players on the financial markets 
that has encouraged a short-term approach and a high level of risk taking.  
Handling of the crisis 
The authorities in Europe and the United States have tried to counter the effects of the crisis 
in a variety of ways and to restore confidence on the financial markets.  
The central banks have primarily contributed by adding large amounts of liquidity via loans 
against collateral to the banks. This has been necessary as the banks have found it difficult 
to  borrow  in  the  short  and  medium  terms.  In  order  to  solve  this  problem,  central  banks  in 
many countries have provided the funding that the banks have not been able to acquire on 
the  market.  Several  central  banks  have  also  actively  handled  problems  in  individual 
institutions. One example is the Bank of England, which in September 2007 provided liquidity 
assistance to the British bank Northern Rock. Another example is the Federal Reserve which 
granted an emergency loan to the US investment bank Bear Sterns in March 2008 when the 
bank experienced an acute shortage of short-term funding. It was, however, not possible to 
rescue Bear Sterns and the Federal Reserve helped to mediate the takeover of the bank by 
JP Morgan. During the autumn of 2008, the central banks also rapidly and significantly cut 
their policy rates, sometimes in coordinated actions, to dampen the effects of the crisis on 
macroeconomic development.  
Governments have offered guarantees and capital injections to minimise the risk of further 
bankruptcies  in  the  banking  sector.  Concern  over  banks  and  other  financial  players  going 
bankrupt  has  namely  been  a  central  component  of  the  financial  turbulence.  Given  the 
BIS Review 7/2009

vulnerable  situation  that  the  global  financial  system  is  now  in,  it  may  be  unwise  to  let 
systemically-important financial institutions go bankrupt. Several countries have also decided 
on a more expansionary fiscal policy to counteract the downturn in economic activity. During 
the spring and summer of last year, the US government began to issue tax rebate cheques. 
Since then, several decisions on measures to stimulate the economy have been taken in the 
United States and in European countries, but also, for example, in China. 
Despite these measures, the financial markets are still functioning much less efficiently than 
normal. Ongoing measures are therefore required to improve the functioning of the financial 
system.  
There is a need to reform the global financial system in order to reduce the likelihood of new 
financial  crises.  It  is  probable  that  the  problems  on  the  financial  markets  have  been 
aggravated  by  weaknesses  in  regulation  and  supervision.  There  is  therefore  room  for 
improvement. However, the changes that are  made should be carefully prepared  and fully 
justified  so  that  regulations  are  not  introduced  that  will  have  more  negative  than  positive 
consequences. Allow me to mention a few examples of possible improvements.  
In  the  first  place,  we  need  to  develop  the  supervision  of  the  financial  system.  The  basic 
problem is that the financial markets are international while supervision largely takes place at 
the  national  level.  In  Europe,  there  is  therefore  a  need  to  strengthen  the  coordination 
between  supervisory  authorities  in  different  countries.  Work  on  this  is  already  underway 
within the European Commission and in various committees. Supervision must also focus to 
a greater degree on macroeconomic problems. I personally believe that in the long run we 
should  set  up  a  European  supervisory  authority  with  responsibility  for  supervision  of  the 
financial  institutions  and  markets  across  Europe.  This  must  then  cooperate  with  financial 
supervisory authorities in Europe and other parts of the world. 
Secondly,  there  is  a  need  to  improve  the  handling  of  cross-border  crises.  Financial  crises 
tend  to  spread  from  one  country  to  another.  For  example,  many  financial  institutions  have 
operations in more than one country. When such an institution experiences difficulties this 
therefore has an impact in several countries. An example of this is the Belgian bank Fortis 
and  the  events  relating  to  the  rescue  of  the  bank  by  the  authorities  in  Belgium,  the 
Netherlands and Luxembourg. Crisis management becomes more effective if contacts and 
concrete arrangements between the countries are already in place. It also becomes simpler 
to  decide  how  the  costs  of  crisis  management  should  be  divided  between  the  countries 
concerned. Joint crisis management exercises and a better flow of information between the 
relevant  authorities  in  the  countries  concerned  also  facilitate  cooperation  in  the  event  of  a 
real crisis.  
Thirdly, the credibility of the credit rating agencies needs to be restored. They have played a 
central role in the events of the current financial crisis and their credibility has been seriously 
undermined. This is, however, an area where it is easy for regulation to go too far. I believe 
that to a large extent we can and should trust in the ability of the credit rating agencies to 
develop their evaluation methods and to restore confidence. Some form of registration and 
supervision may also be needed, but this should not involve intervention in the independent 
evaluations of the agencies. 
Fourthly, the deposit guarantee schemes need to be harmonised. During a financial crisis, it 
is important that there is a system of deposit guarantees to reduce the likelihood of a bank 
run. There have been such schemes in all of the EU countries for several years now with a 
minimum level of EUR 20,000. However, they are designed differently in different countries. 
The  Riksbank  has  therefore  argued  in  the  context  of  European  cooperation  that  these 
schemes should be harmonised. Under the pressure of the financial crisis last autumn it was 
decided that the guarantee level should be at least EUR 50,000 in all countries and in the 
longer term EUR 100,000. However, there are still differences regarding the funding of the 
guarantees and other regulations. These differences distort competition between the banks 
in different countries. They also make it more difficult to achieve effective crisis management.

How Sweden is affected by the financial crisis 
Sweden's dependence on the outside world 
Sweden is highly dependent on events in the world around us. Sweden is a small and open 
economy with extensive foreign trade and a financial market that is well integrated with the 
international markets. Sweden's dependence on the outside world has increased over time. 
This  means  that  a  global  financial  crisis  combined  with  a  severe  international  economic 
downturn has a substantial impact on the Swedish economy.  
One way of illustrating a country's dependence on developments internationally is to consider 
exports  and  imports  as  a  proportion  of  the  total  balance  of  resources.  The  proportion  of 
Swedish exports has, for example, increased from just over 20 per cent in 1990 to around 40 
per cent in 2007. This means that an international economic downturn and a decline in the 
demand  for  Swedish  export  goods  have  serious  consequences  for  production  and 
employment in Sweden.  
The  financial  links  between  countries  have  also  become  stronger  and  make  the  Swedish 
banks dependent on the outside world. Market funding, that is, funding that is not in the form 
of deposits, accounts for around 60 per cent of their total balance sheets and is acquired on 
international markets. Both market funding and the banks’ operations abroad have increased 
substantially  over  the  past  ten  years.  This  means  that  events  abroad  have  an  increasing 
impact in Sweden.  
The long-term interest rates for government bonds in different countries usually follow one 
another  quite  closely.  There  is  also  a  close  correlation  between  the  stock  markets  and 
expectations  regarding  the  future.  These  links  may  be  one  explanation  as  to  why  the 
development  of  GDP  in  different  countries  is  currently  very  consistent.  Traditionally,  there 
has  been  a  time  lag  between  developments  in  economic  activity  in  the  United  States  and 
Europe, such that an economic downturn in the United States has also been followed by a 
downturn in Europe, but at a somewhat later date. An issue that has been widely discussed 
in the last two years is whether other parts of the world would be able to avoid a recession 
despite the weak development of the US economy, that is if so-called decoupling could arise. 
We can now note that the rest of the world is following in the wake of the United States into 
an economic downturn and the debate on decoupling has faded.  
Measures to counter the crisis 
Sweden has so far been able to manage the problems caused in the financial system by the 
global  financial  crisis.  The  Swedish  banks  are  profitable  and  have  substantial  buffers 
following a number of good years. They have not granted loans as hastily as the banks in the 
United States and they have not been exposed to any great extent to the type of financial 
products that have been part of the problem. The TED spreads have not been as large as in 
the United States and the euro area. The interbank market for overnight loans has functioned 
well in Sweden throughout the crisis, unlike in many other countries. But the Swedish banks 
have nevertheless experienced problems with funding and this has required that a number of 
measures be taken by Swedish authorities. 
The Riksbank has implemented a large number of measures to safeguard financial stability 
and mitigate the negative effects of the financial crisis. These measures have largely related 
to the provision of liquidity. Liquidity can be supplied generally to the market or in the form of 
specific assistance for individual financial institutions. The Riksbank has used both of these 
alternatives. 
The general liquidity assistance has been designed so that the Riksbank has supplied the 
banks with loans in kronor and dollars at longer maturities than the market has been able to 
offer.  In  total  this  lending  has  amounted  to  over  SEK  450  billion.  Lending  in  kronor  has 
increased  by  more  than  SEK  250  billion  and  lending  in  dollars  by  almost  SEK  200  billion. 
BIS Review 7/2009

This  means  that  the  Riksbank's  balance  sheet  for  the  second  half  of  2008  has  increased 
from SEK 200 billion at the end of June to SEK 700 billion at the turn of the year. 
The loans from the Riksbank together with Swedbank's borrowing under the government's 
guarantee  programme  mean  that  the  State  provided  or  guaranteed more  or  less  all  of  the 
banking sector's borrowing in the last few months of 2008. 
The  Riksbank  has  also  set  up  a  temporary  credit  facility  based  on  commercial  papers  in 
order to improve the supply of credit for non-financial companies. These companies can fund 
their  operations  by  issuing  commercial  papers  and  selling  them  to  the  banks.  The 
commercial papers can then be used by the banks as security for loans from the Riksbank. 
However, the scope of these activities has been fairly limited. 
The Icelandic bank Kaupthing experienced problems in Iceland and the Riksbank granted the 
Swedish  subsidiary  Kaupthing  Bank  Sverige  AB  liquidity  assistance  in  October  2008. 
Carnegie  Investment  Bank  AB  also  received  liquidity  assistance  in  October  when  it  had 
problems finding funding. Given the financial market turbulence, the Riksbank’s assessment 
was  that  a  suspension  of  payments  by  one  of  the  banks  could  entail  a  risk  of  a  serious 
disruption in the financial system and could undermine confidence in the payment system. 
Finansinspektionen  (the  Swedish  financial  supervisory  authority)  later  revoked  Carnegie’s 
licence  to  conduct  banking  activities.  The  Swedish  National  Debt  Office  took  control  over 
Carnegie and Finansinspektionen therefore changed its decision regarding the revocation of 
the  licence  to  instead  giving  the  bank  a  warning.  The  Riksbank’s  liquidity  assistance  has 
been repaid.  
The  Riksbank  has  also  participated  in  the  international  cooperation  to  strengthen  financial 
stability  in  Sweden's  neighbouring  countries.  In  May  2008,  the  Riksbank  and  the  central 
banks in Denmark and Norway entered into a euro/Icelandic kronor swap agreement with the 
central bank of Iceland. The aim of this swap agreement is to support the Icelandic central 
bank in its efforts to safeguard macroeconomic and financial stability. Sweden's part of the 
swap agreement amounts to EUR 500 million. The agreement was extended in December 
after the IMF had drawn up a programme for financial assistance for Iceland.  
Latvia has negotiated a support package with the IMF and the EU which will make it possible 
for the country to retain its fixed exchange rate against the euro. In December, the Riksbank 
and the Danish central bank entered into a swap agreement with the Latvian central bank. 
Under this agreement, Latvia may borrow up to EUR 500 million in exchange for Latvian lats. 
The intention was that this agreement would act as temporary funding in order to strengthen 
financial stability in Latvia until the IMF decided on its support package. The support package 
was approved by the IMF just before Christmas. 
It is not only the Riksbank that has taken action to counter the effects of the financial crisis. 
The Swedish National Debt Office, Finansinspektionen and the Government have also acted 
to safeguard the functioning of the Swedish financial system and to mitigate the effects of the 
crisis on the real economy.  
The  National  Debt  Office  has  acted  to  meet  the  dramatic  increase  in  demand  for  treasury 
bills. Extra auctions have been held in order to issue larger volumes of short-term treasury 
bills than normal. By the turn of the year, the National Debt Office had issued more than SEK 
190 billion in treasury bills over and above the regular loan programme.  
During the autumn, Finansinspektionen decided to change the regulations for calculating the 
discount  rate  for  life  insurance  companies.  The  aim  was  to  arrive  at  a  more  reasonable 
calculation  of  the  companies’  debts  and  to  mitigate  disruptions  on  the  bond  markets. 
Finansinspektionen  has  also  altered  the  capital  adequacy  rules  for  credit  institutions  and 
securities  companies.  The  aim  of  this  change  is  to  make  it  possible  for  the  financial 
companies to strengthen their capital situation by being able to have a greater proportion of 
financial instruments other than shares in their capital base.

 BIS Review 7/2009
At the beginning of October, the Government decided to increase the maximum sum in the 
deposit  guarantee  scheme  and  to  extend  the  scheme  to  cover  all  types  of  deposit  in 
accounts. During the autumn, the Government also presented a plan to further safeguard the 
stability of the financial system. This plan includes a guarantee programme of a maximum of 
SEK 1,500 billion to support the medium-term funding of banks and mortgage institutions. It 
also  comprises  a  stability  fund  to  handle  any  future  solvency  problems  in  Swedish 
institutions.  In  common  with  several  other  countries,  Sweden  is  also  pursuing  an 
expansionary fiscal policy in order to counter the downturn in economic activity.  
Experiences of earlier financial crises 
The negative consequences for the Swedish economy will be considerable over the next two 
years.  There  are  two  essential  differences  between  the  current  financial  crisis  and  the 
Swedish bank crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. Firstly, the current crisis is a global one, 
spread over a large number of markets, assets and institutions, while the bank crisis at the 
beginning  of  the  1990s  was  limited  to  Sweden  and  other  Nordic  countries.  Secondly,  the 
major problem so far has been the financing of the banks’ operations, while the problem last 
time was credit losses linked to falling property prices. The positive element here is that the 
current problems are not due to poor profitability or large credit losses. The negative element 
is  that  even  a  country  with  a  profitable  bank  system  with  large  buffers  can  experience 
problems. Iceland is one example of how a small country with an open economy and its own 
currency can be affected by a financial crisis.  
I pointed out on several occasions at the monetary policy meetings held last year that there 
is a considerable risk that the crisis will be both more profound and more prolonged than we 
assume in our forecasts. I would like to take this opportunity to develop my reasons.  
Kenneth Rogoff is another of the advisers to the Executive Board of the Riksbank. Together 
with Carmen Reinhart he has made a number of studies of financial crises. They consider 
the Swedish bank crisis of the 1990s to be one of the most serious financial crises, “the big 
five”.3  One  of  their  studies  shows  that  the  financial  crises  that  have  occurred  in  industrial 
nations in recent decades have been followed by long periods of weak growth.4 Seen as an 
average of the 18 crises reported, this concerns a period of three years of low growth and for 
the "big five" an average of three years of negative growth.  
The most recent study also includes financial crises in emerging economies.5 Here they point 
to three common features. Firstly, house and share prices fall substantially and over a long 
period of time. For house prices the average fall in real terms is 35 per cent extended over 
six years and for shares it is 55 per cent over three and a half years. Secondly, production 
and  employment  fall.  On  average,  GDP  per  capita  falls  by  9  per  cent  over  two  years  and 
unemployment rises by an average of 7 percentage points over four years. Thirdly, central 
government debt almost doubles, not as a result of the costs of recapitalising the financial 
system, but due to falling tax revenues and fiscal policy stimulation measures. 
How  relevant  are  these  comparisons  in  analysing  the  current  crisis?  Reinhart  and  Rogoff 
themselves point out on the one hand that the monetary policy frameworks are now more 
flexible and that the central banks have acted more aggressively than before. On the other 
hand, the crisis in question is a global financial crisis, which makes it more difficult to grow 
                                                 
3   The countries that have suffered these crises are Finland, Japan, Norway, Spain and Sweden.

out  of  the  crisis  by,  for  instance,  increasing  exports  than  when  it  is  a  national  or  regional 
crisis as most of the previous crises have been. 
My assessment is that one should not attach too much importance to the exact figures. They 
are dependent on which countries are included in the averages. But they nevertheless imply 
that there is a tangible risk that the economic downturn will be both more profound and more 
prolonged than we are assuming in our main scenario, and that 2010 will also be a year of 
weak or negative growth in many countries. 
The current economic situation and monetary policy 
Using  monetary  policy  to  combat  a  financial  crisis  is  not  particularly  effective.  It  is  not 
possible to manage a financial crisis by means of adjustments to the repo rate. The Riksbank 
has therefore been concentrating on other measures to promote financial stability since the 
Lehman crisis. On the other hand, monetary policy can be used to alleviate the effects of the 
financial crisis on macroeconomic developments.  
At the most recent monetary policy meeting on 3 December, we Executive Board members 
decided to cut the repo rate by 1.75 percentage points. This was the largest cut made since 
the repo rate system was introduced in 1994. It meant that during the autumn the Riksbank 
had cut the repo rate from 4.75 per cent to 2.00 per cent. The ECB has also cut its policy rate 
over the past two months to the current 2 per cent and in the United States the policy rate is 
close to zero. 
We Executive Board members were agreed that a large cut in the repo rate was necessary 
to  dampen  the  rapid  economic  downturn  that  had  become  evident.  Inflation  had  already 
begun to decline and is expected to undershoot the Riksbank’s target of 2 per cent in 2009. 
However,  underlying  inflation,  which  is  when  the  effects  of  our  own  interest  rate  cuts  and 
falling energy prices are excluded, will be close to 2 per cent during 2009, according to the 
forecasts in the Monetary Policy Update.  
A complicating factor is that the relationship between the repo rate and market rates has not 
been normal in recent months. Market rates fell less than might have been expected when 
the repo rate was cut in October. The spread between the repo rate and the banks’ lending 
rates increased. But towards the end of the year the repo rate cut had a greater impact. For 
instance, short-term mortgage rates have been lowered more or less as much as the repo 
rate up to January. But in other areas the difference between the repo rate and market rates 
is much greater. 
The  financial  crisis  has  also  affected  the  Swedish  krona.  However,  the  Riksbank’s 
assessment  is  that  the  weakening  of  the  krona  is  temporary  and  primarily  a  result  of  the 
financial crisis. In times of financial turbulence investors tend to turn to the larger currencies, 
which are regarded as "safer”. The result of this flight to quality is that smaller currencies like 
the Swedish krona weaken. The Norwegian krona has also depreciated substantially.  
But there is a risk that this weakening will be more prolonged. This would normally lead to 
exports  strengthening  and  imports  slowing  down,  and  at  the  same  time  provide  an 
inflationary  impulse.  During  a  normal  economic downturn  it  may  be  an  advantage  that  the 
currency  depreciates  in  this  way  and  thus  dampens  the  downturn.  In  the  current 
circumstances, with a serious global financial crisis that may result in financing problems for 
entire countries, the situation may become more problematic. Several countries in Europe, in 
addition to Iceland, have seen their currencies depreciate substantially.  
In December the forecast was that GDP  will decline by 0.5 per cent during 2009, but that 
growth will recover in 2010. The information received since then indicates that GDP growth in 
the fourth quarter of last year was weaker than we had been expecting, which will also push 
down  the  average  for  the  year  2009.  Industrial  production,  production  of  services  and  the 
activity index all fell in November. The National Institute of Economic Research’s Economic 
8 
 BIS Review 7/2009
Tendency  Survey  and  the  purchasing  managers’  index  continued  to  fall  in  December, 
reaching all-time lows.  
Inflation fell from 4.0 per cent in October to 0.9 per cent in December. Inflation was much 
lower  than  we  had  expected  in  December,  as  a  result  of  the  repo  rate  cuts  made  in  the 
autumn having a greater impact on mortgage rates than anticipated and petrol prices being 
lower  than  forecast.  Underlying  inflation  excluding  interest  rates  and  energy  (the  CPIF 
excluding energy) declined slightly from around 2 per cent earlier this year to 1.7 per cent in 
December, entirely in line with the forecast at the most recent monetary policy meeting.  
The krona has weakened further since the beginning of December. Since the financial crisis 
moved into an acute phase in mid-September, the krona has weakened by around 12 per 
cent  when  measured  against  a  trade-weighted  index.  This  could  give  a  slightly  larger 
inflationary impulse than we had previously forecast.  
There  are  a  number  of  signs  that  the  situation  in  the  financial  markets  has  improved 
somewhat since the beginning of December. The TED spreads have fallen to the levels that 
applied  prior  to  September  and  it  has  to  some  extent  been  possible  to  issue  bonds.  The 
forceful measures taken in many countries have in any case meant that it has been possible 
to avoid a collapse in the financial markets. But there are other signs that are more worrying. 
The  financial  markets  are  still  far  from  functioning  normally.  Surveys  indicate  that  the 
companies’ difficulties  in  obtaining  loans  have  increased,  although  there  is  as  yet no  solid 
data showing that bank lending has begun to decline. Another problem is that the difference 
between rates on different euro countries government bonds has increased, at the same time 
as one can envisage substantially increasing deficits in public funds and thus an increased 
supply of government bonds.    
Concluding remarks 
My main messages today have thus been that so far Sweden has been able to handle the 
problems that the global financial crisis has caused the Swedish financial system. However, 
the negative consequences for the Swedish economy will be considerable over the next two 
years. And the global financial system needs to be reformed to reduce the likelihood of new 
financial crises.  
The  new  information  received  since  the  most  recent  monetary  policy  meeting  at  the 
beginning of December indicates lower growth and inflation at the end of last year than we 
had forecast. However, the krona has weakened further, which can lead to some inflationary 
impulses.  But  more  information  will  have  come  in  by  the  time  we  are  to  make  our  next 
monetary policy decision in early February. Not until then will I take a stance once again on 
the future direction for monetary policy.
