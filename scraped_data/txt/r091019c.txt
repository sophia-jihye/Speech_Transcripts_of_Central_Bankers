Charles Bean: Quantitative Easing – an interim report 
Speech by Mr Charles Bean, Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy at the Bank of England, 
to the London Society of Chartered Accountants, London, 13 October 2009. 
 It’s a great pleasure to be invited to speak to you this afternoon.  
It is almost exactly a year since Lehman Brothers collapsed, precipitating a near-fatal heart 
attack for the global financial system. And in its wake came an unprecedentedly sharp and 
synchronised contraction in global economic activity, from which we are only just starting to 
emerge. In part, that stabilisation reflects the intensity of the countervailing policy actions by 
governments and central banks around the world. Injections of capital, funding guarantees, 
ring-fencing of toxic assets and abundant liquidity support have helped to return the banking 
system towards normality, though the process of balance-sheet repair still has some way to 
go.  And  substantial  increases  in  fiscal  deficits  and  aggressively  expansionary  monetary 
policies have helped to arrest the fall in spending, output and employment.  
For its part, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee not only cut Bank Rate from 
5% in September last year to just 0.5% in February, but also embarked on a programme of 
large  scale  asset  purchases  financed  by  the  issuance  of  extra  reserves  –  so-called 
“Quantitative Easing”. This unlovely phrase was originally coined to describe a related policy 
conducted  by  the  Bank  of  Japan  in  the  early  part  of  this  decade  and  has  perhaps  lost 
something  in  the  translation.  But  sadly  it  is  a phrase  that we  are  now  well  and  truly  stuck 
with. 
Like a lot of our operations, Quantitative Easing can seem a bit mysterious and confusing to 
those  not  steeped  in  what  central  banks  do.  As  much  of  this  confusion  arises  from  a 
misunderstanding of the Bank of England’s accounts, I am therefore delighted to be speaking 
to an audience of accountants, who might find this arcane subject rather exciting! 
In January this year, the Chancellor authorised the Bank to create a new fund – the Asset 
Purchase Facility – for the purpose of buying assets from the private sector. Any profits on 
the Asset Purchase Facility are passed to Her Majesty’s Treasury, while any losses are also 
indemnified by the Exchequer. The accounts are therefore not consolidated with the Bank’s 
own accounts, as the Bank has no economic interest in the fund. 
Initially, the Facility purchased commercial paper, funded by the proceeds of sales of short-
term Treasury bills by the Debt Management Office. This asset swap took credit risk onto the 
public sector’s balance sheet and was therefore more akin to a fiscal operation. But since 
March,  purchases  have  been  on  a  much  larger  scale  and  funded  through  the  issuance  of 
central  bank  reserves  rather  than  Treasury  bills.  The  bulk  of  the  purchases  have  been  of 
government bonds, though a small quantity of investment-grade corporate bonds have also 
been  bought.  So  far,  about  £164  billion  of  assets  have  been  purchased  in  this  way,  as 
against  the  Monetary  Policy  Committee’s  current  target  of  £175  billion.  To  put  that  in 
perspective, £175 billion represents roughly 12% of annual GDP.  
Technically what happens is the following. The Asset Purchase Facility buys assets funded 
by a loan from the Bank. In turn, the Bank funds that loan through additional reserve creation 
(Chart 1). If this sounds like financial alchemy, consider how the money flows through the 
system.  When  the  Asset  Purchase  Facility  buys  a  gilt  from  a  pension  fund,  say,  it  can  be 
thought  of  as  paying  with  a  cheque  drawn  on  the  Bank  of England.  The  pension  fund  will 
then bank the cheque with its own commercial bank, so the latter now has a claim on the 
Bank  of  England  –  that  is  what  reserves  are.  In  reality,  these  payments  are  not  made  by 
cheque, but rather are carried out electronically. But the principle is the same, though one 
key difference is that we pay Bank Rate to the commercial bank on its claim on us, as well as 
charging Bank Rate on the loan we make to the Asset Purchase Facility.

Now I can add detours for the money at any point in this cycle. For example, the pension 
fund that sold the gilt to the Asset Purchase Facility might now withdraw its deposit and use it 
to  purchase  a  newly  issued  corporate  bond.  The  company  issuing the bond  then  deposits 
that money in their own bank. So now it is the corporate’s bank that holds the claim on us. A 
similar  sort  of  circle  occurs  if  the  corporate  then  uses  its  deposit  to  buy  a  new  piece  of 
machinery,  because  the  seller  of  that  machinery  will  end  up  putting  the  proceeds  into  her 
bank, so that the claim on the Bank of England is now held by the capital goods producer’s 
bank. Whatever the type of purchase, it will always end up with someone’s commercial bank 
having a claim on us. That is even the case if the money is used to buy foreign goods, as the 
foreign  commercial  bank  will  need  to  exchange  the  sterling  claim  with  a  commercial  bank 
that holds an account with us, if it does not do so itself. The only way that the claim can be 
eliminated from the system is if a bank chooses to exchange it for cash, which would make 
little sense since cash pays no interest at all. 
The reason for going through this in such mind-numbing detail is to make the point that the 
level of commercial banks’ reserves in aggregate is determined by the way we have funded 
the  asset  purchases,  not  by  the  commercial  banks’  own  decisions.  The  size  of  banks’ 
reserves cannot, as is frequently claimed, be a sign that they are “sitting on them”. No matter 
how  rapidly  or  how  slowly  the  economy  is  growing,  or  how  fast  or  slow  the  money  is 
circulating, the aggregate amount of reserves will be exactly the same. So it should be clear 
that  the  quantity  of  central  bank  reserves  held  by  the  commercial  banks  is  useless  as  an 
indicator of the effectiveness of Quantitative Easing. 
Now obviously we would prefer that the money circulates more rapidly and that this is done 
through increased bank lending and deposit taking. In other words, we would like to see a 
further  expansion  of  credit  and  broad  money.  Since  the  banks  collectively  are  now  awash 
with  reserves,  they  should  not  be  prevented  from  making  additional  loans  because  of  any 
liquidity  concerns.  Banks  are,  though,  constrained  by  a  lack  of  capital  and  are  looking  to 
reduce leverage rather than increase it.  
Fortunately, increased bank lending is not necessary for Quantitative Easing to work. Indeed, 
it was precisely because the Monetary Policy Committee expected the additional monetary 
injection  not  to  stimulate  bank  lending  directly  at  the  current  juncture,  that  the  Asset 
Purchase Facility’s purchases were targeted at assets held primarily by the non-bank private 
sector1. So if the Asset Purchase Facility buys gilts from pension funds or asset managers, 
they will then have to look for another home for their money. As it is not very rewarding just 
to hold it on deposit, they are likely to look to  put their money into other assets, including 
equities and corporate bonds. Thus not only does the price of gilts rise as a consequence of 
the  Asset  Purchase  Facility’s  initial  purchases,  but  also  the  prices  of  a  whole  spectrum  of 
other  assets.  That  in  turn  lowers  the  cost  of  non-bank  finance  and  encourages  increased 
corporate  issuance.  Also  the  rise  in  asset  prices  increases  wealth  and  improves  balance 
sheets.  In  this  way,  Quantitative  Easing  helps  to  work  around  the  blockage  created  by  a 
banking system that is still undergoing a process of balance sheet repair.  
That  is  exactly  what  we  have  seen  since  the  Monetary  Policy  Committee  started  its  asset 
purchase  program.  Gilt  yields  fell  sharply,  though  they  have  subsequently  risen  and  fallen 
again  (Chart  2).  But  gilt  yields  can  move  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  changing 
expectations  of  future  interest  rates.  If  we  control  for  that  by  comparing  gilt  yields  with  a 
measure of market expectations of the future level of Bank Rate (Overnight Indexed Swap 
rates for an equivalent maturity), we find that this spread has fallen by around ¾ percentage 
point (Chart 3). Moreover, no such movement is observed in either the United States or euro 
                                                 
1   That is in contrast to the related policy conducted by the Bank of Japan in the early part of this decade, which 
was instead directed at purchases of Japanese government debt held by the banking sector.

area, which strongly suggests that the movement may be related to our gilt purchases2. More 
importantly  for  the  real  economy,  sterling  investment-grade  corporate  bond  spreads  have 
fallen over three and a half percentage points since the start of Quantitative Easing (Chart 4). 
And equity prices have risen by almost a half, the fifth largest increase in a six-month period 
over the past three hundred years (Chart 5). Accompanying this, UK companies have issued 
over  £60  billion  worth  of  bonds  and  equities  since  January,  compared  with  an  annual 
average of around £40 billion in recent years (Chart 6). Moreover, the spread between the 
three-month  interbank  rate  over  expected  Bank  Rate,  which  had  been  unusually  elevated 
during the crisis, particularly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, has fallen by almost 1½ 
percentage points and is now more or less back to pre-crisis levels (Chart 7).  
All  this  suggests  that  Quantitative  Easing  is  having  the  expected  effects  on  the  economy. 
However,  there  may  also  be  other  reasons  why  asset  prices  have  recovered  in  recent 
months. Early in the year, there were considerable fears that the recession would continue to 
deepen, whereas it now seems that activity here and elsewhere has probably troughed, so 
some  of  the  worst  downside  risks  look  unlikely  to  crystallise.  And  asset  prices  have  been 
rising not only here, but elsewhere, though that could reflect the aggressive monetary policy 
measures adopted by other central banks too. 
Moreover,  the  ultimate  aim  of  the  policy  is  to  get  the  annual  rate  of  growth  of  nominal 
spending in the economy back to the 5% or so that it averaged during the first decade of the 
Monetary Policy Committee’s existence and which is consistent with inflation at target and 
growth at trend. In contrast, over the past year, nominal spending has fallen by roughly 5% 
(Chart 8). The £175 billion of asset purchases has been calibrated with this in mind, though it 
will be some while yet before we know how effective the policy has been in achieving the 
objective. 
Indeed,  the  truth  is  that  we  will  probably  never  know  exactly  how  effective  the  policy  of 
Quantitative Easing has been, for the simple reason that we can never know with precision 
what  would  have  happened  in  its  absence.  My  only  confident  prediction  is  that  academic 
economists and their PhD students will be poring over the topic for decades to come. 
To  conclude,  I  want  to  return  to  some  accounting  issues.  As  I  noted  earlier,  the  Asset 
Purchase Facility is set up as a separate entity, indemnified by the Treasury. The Bank is 
committed to transparency about its operations, and we will be publishing annual accounts 
for  the  Asset  Purchase  Facility,  drawn  up  in  accordance  with  established  international 
accounting principles. 
The Asset Purchase Facility receives coupon payments from the government on the gilts it 
holds,  as  well  as  some  income  from  its  small  holding  of  corporate  assets.  The  Asset 
Purchase Facility also pays interest at Bank Rate to the Bank of England on the loan used to 
buy the assets. At present, the average coupon on the purchased gilts is around 5%, which 
substantially exceeds Bank Rate at 0.5%. Consequently the net interest income of the Fund 
is  positive.  But  international  accounting  principles  dictate  that  the  assets  on  the  balance 
sheet of the Asset Purchase Facility are also marked to market. Since gilt prices are highly 
sensitive to movements in discount rates, it is quite plausible that falls in the prices of gilts as 
a  result  of  any  future  increase  in  discount  rates  will  leave  the  Asset  Purchase  Facility 
accounts in deficit overall. 
The  question  is:  Does  this  matter?  At  first  sight,  any  loss  on  the  Asset  Purchase  Facility 
would represent a cost to the taxpayer, given the Treasury indemnity. But of course the gilts 
held in one part of the public sector, the Asset Purchase Facility, are just a liability of the rest 
of the public sector. In the accounts for the rest of the public sector, there must therefore be

US Treasuries represent a much smaller fraction of the market.

offsetting  interest  flows,  as  well  as  corresponding  capital  gains  or  losses,  at  least  if  those 
accounts were also to be marked to market. So gilt price movements necessarily all wash out 
once the public accounts are compiled on a consistent basis, at least so long as the assets 
are retained within the public sector3. 
We do not, however, expect to retain all the purchased assets in the Asset Purchase Facility 
to maturity.  At some stage, as the recovery proceeds, the Monetary  Policy Committee will 
need  gradually  to  remove  the  large  monetary  stimulus  that  we  have  imparted  to  the 
economy,  otherwise  we  will  be  in  danger  of  overshooting  our  2%  inflation  target.  That 
monetary tightening will take the form of some combination of a higher level of Bank Rate 
and asset sales from the Asset Purchase Facility to the private sector. The process of selling 
off the gilts can then be expected to push gilt yields back up towards where they would have 
been  in  the  absence  of  the  Quantitative  Easing  programme.  When  the  Asset  Purchase 
Facility is finally run down, won’t the closing accounts tell us about the benefits or costs of 
the programme? 
The answer to this is: No. The first point to make is that the aim of Quantitative Easing and 
the  Asset  Purchase  Facility  is  to  help  the  Monetary  Policy  Committee  achieve  its 
macroeconomic objective, namely hitting the Government’s inflation target without generating 
undue volatility in output. The accounts of the Asset Purchase Facility are not designed to 
address  these  overall  macroeconomic  costs  or  benefits,  which  instead  requires  an 
assessment of the impact of Quantitative Easing on demand and inflation. As I have already 
noted,  this  is  a  difficult  issue  which  is  likely  to  keep  researchers  busy  for  many  years  to 
come. 
Second, even if one were interested in the rather narrower issue of the impact of Quantitative 
Easing on the public finances, whether the Treasury ends up with a profit or a loss from the 
Asset Purchase Facility represents only a small part of the picture. Gilt yields will be lower 
than  they  would  otherwise  have  been  during  the  period  that  they  are  held  in  the  Asset 
Purchase Facility, so reducing the cost of financing a given budget deficit. This needs to be 
factored  into  any  calculation  of  the  implications  for  the  public  finances.  Rather  more 
significantly, Quantitative Easing is intended to boost spending and activity. In the process, it 
should  raise  tax  revenues  and  reduce  benefit  payments.  And,  unless  Quantitative  Easing 
proves  to  be  largely  ineffective,  this  effect  is  likely  to  dominate  the  other  elements  of  the 
calculation. 
Finally, it is worth noting that normal monetary policy, conducted by varying Bank Rate, also 
generally  affects  both  gilt  yields  and  activity.  Consequently,  it  too  has  an  influence  on  the 
public  finances,  including  through  the  Bank’s  balance  sheet.  Yet  we  usually  do  not  try  to 
conduct  such  an  exercise.  The  success  of  policy  is  instead  judged  by  whether  the 
macroeconomic objectives are met.  
The  moral  from  all  this  is  one  that  will  be  all  too  familiar  to  you  as  accountants,  though 
perhaps one that sometimes gets forgotten by consumers of accounting statements, namely 
that  the  appropriate  way  to  frame  accounts  depends  on  how  they  will  be  used  and  what 
questions  are  being  asked.  The  Asset  Purchase  Facility  accounts  may  tell us  the scale  of 
gains or losses on the Asset Purchase Facility portfolio narrowly considered, but will miss the 
impact on the public finances from higher activity and lower financing costs and fail to tell us 
anything about it macroeconomic effectiveness. The rise in asset prices and the recovery in 
confidence  since  the  start  of  the  Quantitative  Easing  program  have  been  significant.  We 
cannot identify precisely how much of this is a direct result of Quantitative Easing, and hence 
the  scale  of  the  boost  to  tax  revenues.  I  have  no  doubt  that  this  issue  will  continue  to  be 
debated  for  years  to  come,  and  that  some  sceptics  may  remain  unconvinced.  But  even  a 
sceptic  should  acknowledge  that  the  net  accounting  gain  or  loss  on  the  Asset  Purchase 
                                                 
3   Of course that is not true of holdings of corporate assets.
