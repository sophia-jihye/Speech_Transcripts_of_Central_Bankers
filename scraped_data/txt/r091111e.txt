 Introduction 
1.  
Historically, the link between the state and the banking system has been umbilical. Starting 
with  the  first  Italian  banking  houses  in  the  13th  century,  banks  were  financiers  of  the 
sovereign.  Sovereign  need  was  often  greatest  following  war.  The  Bank  of  England  was 
established at the end of the 17th century for just this purpose, financing the war debts of 
William III. 
From  the  earliest  times,  the  relationship  between  banks  and  the  state  was  often  rocky. 
Sovereign default on loans was an everyday hazard for the banks, especially among states 
vanquished in war. Indeed, through the ages sovereign default has been the single biggest 
cause  of  banking  collapse.1  It  led  to  the  downfall  of  many  of  the  founding  Italian  banks, 
including the Medici of Florence. 
As  awareness  of  sovereign  risk  grew,  banks  began  to  charge  higher  loan  rates  to  the 
sovereign than to commercial entities. In the 15th century, Charles VIII of France paid up to 
100% on war loans to Italian banks, which were at the same time charging Italian merchants 
5-10%.2  The  Bank  of  England’s  first  loan  to  government  carried  an  interest  rate  of  8%  – 
double the rate at which the Bank discounted trade bills. 
For  the  past  two  centuries,  the  tables  have  progressively  turned.  The  state  has  instead 
become the last-resort financier of the banks. As with the state, banks’ needs have typically 
been  greatest  at  times  of  financial  crisis.  And  like  the  state,  last-resort  financing  has  not 
always been repaid in full and on time. The Great Depression marked a regime-shift in state 
support to the banking system. The credit crisis of the past two years may well mark another.  
Table 1 provides a snap-shot of the scale of intervention to support the banks in the UK, US 
and the euro-area during the current crisis. This totals over $14 trillion or almost a quarter of 
global GDP. It dwarfs any previous state support of the banking system. These interventions 
have been as imaginative as they have large, including liquidity and capital injections, debt 
guarantees, deposit insurance and asset purchase.  
The costs of this intervention are already being felt. As in the Middle Ages, perceived risks 
from lending to the state are larger than to some corporations. The price of default insurance 
is higher for some G7 governments than for McDonalds or the Campbell Soup Company. Yet 
there is one key difference between the situation today and that in the Middle Ages. Then, 
the biggest risk to the banks was from the sovereign. Today, perhaps the biggest risk to the 
sovereign comes from the banks. Causality has reversed.  
State  support  is  one  side  of  the  “social  contract”  between  banks  and  the  state.3  State 
regulation of banks is the other. Table 1 suggests that the terms of this social contract have

recently worsened. That should come as no surprise. At least over the past century, there is 
evidence of a ratchet in the scale and scope of state support of the banking system (Section 
2). Whenever banking crises strike, the safety net has bulged. Like over-stretched elastic, it 
has remained distended.  
What  explains  this  ratchet?  All  contracts  are  incomplete.4  Contractual  relationships,  like 
personal ones, often break down due to commitment problems. Social contracts between the 
state  and  the  banks  are  no  exception.  This  generates  a  time-consistency  problem  for  the 
authorities when dealing with crisis – a tendency to talk tough but act weak. This explains 
historical hysteresis in the safety net (Section 3).  
So what can be done? There are many reform proposals on the table.5 Two sets of initiative 
are discussed here: changes to the regulation of banks’ risk-taking; and changes to the terms 
of the social safety net to improve its time-consistency. It is too early to know whether these 
measures will be sufficient. But recent events suggest some mix of these measures is surely 
necessary. 
Evolution in the banking safety net  
2.  
The  three  longest  standing  state  insurance  devices  for  the  banking  system  are  liquidity 
insurance, deposit insurance and capital insurance. These offer protection to different parts 
of  banks’  capital  structure,  respectively  wholesale  deposits,  retail  deposits  and  equity.  So 
how have risks to banks’ balance sheets – in effect, the “insurable interests” of the state – 
evolved  over  time?  And  how,  in  turn,  has  this evolution  shaped  the  design  of  the banking 
safety net? 
The  UK  provides  a  useful  historical  case  study.  Chart  1  plots  UK  banks’  balance  sheet 
against  GDP  since  1880.  The  ratio  is  flat  for  almost  a  century,  at  around  50%.  Over  this 
period, banks’ assets grew roughly in line with money spending. But from the early 1970s, 
this  pattern  changed  dramatically.  By  the  start  of  this  century,  bank  balance  sheets  were 
more than five times annual UK GDP. In the space of a generation, the insurable interests of 
the state had risen tenfold. 
By itself, this expansion of balance sheets need not imply that the state was bearing greater 
implicit risk. For example, banks could have self-insured by holding larger buffers of capital 
and liquidity. In practice, the opposite happened (Charts 2 and 3). Capital and liquidity ratios 
have fallen secularly in the UK and US for over a century.  
Since the start of the 20th century, capital ratios have fallen by a factor of around five in the 
US and UK. Liquidity ratios have fallen by roughly the same amount in half that time. Taken 
together, these balance sheet trends indicate a pronounced rise in banking system risk and 
hence in potential demand for state insurance. They have also affected the returns required 
by bank shareholders.  
As banks moved up the risk spectrum, the return required by shareholders has predictably 
increased. Between 1920 and 1970, the return on UK banks’ equity averaged below 10% per 
annum, with low volatility of around 2% per year (Chart 4). This was roughly in line with risks 
and returns in the non-financial economy. 
The 1970s signalled a sea-change. Since then returns on UK banks’ equity have averaged 
over 20%. Immediately prior to the crisis, returns were close to 30%. The natural bedfellow to 
higher  return  is  higher  risk.  And  so  it  was,  with  the  volatility  of  UK  banks’  returns  having 
trebled over the past forty years.

Indeed, contract incompleteness is one of the reasons banks exist in the first place (Rajan (1998)).

This regime shift upwards in the risk and return profile of UK banks can be explained by the 
fall  in  their  capital  ratios.  Higher  leverage  boosts  required  returns  on  equity  because  it 
simultaneously makes the banking system’s balance sheet more fragile. There is unlikely to 
be a better case study of these dynamics at play than events over the past decade.  
So how has the state’s safety net evolved in response? The element of the safety net with 
the longest historical pedigree is liquidity insurance, typically provided by the central bank in 
the form of last resort lending. The principles behind last resort lending were first articulated 
by Henry Thornton at the beginning of the 19th century and were subsequently elaborated by 
Walter Bagehot.6  
Last resort lending in practice was often rather less elegant than the theory. Writing at the 
time of the 1825 banking crisis, Jeremiah Harman, Director of the Bank, described it thus: 
“We lent [money] by every possible means and in modes  we have never 
adopted  before;  we  took  in  stock  on  security,  we  purchased  Exchequer 
bills,  we  made  advances  on  Exchequer  bills,  we  not  only  discounted 
outright, but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange to an 
immense  amount,  in  short,  by  every  possible  means  consistent  with  the 
safety of the Bank…Seeing the dreadful state in which the public were, we 
rendered every assistance in our power.”7
Chart 5 plots the Bank of England’s balance sheet in relation to GDP since 1830. Stripping 
out the effects of the two World Wars, this ratio has declined fairly steadily, from around 15% 
in 1830 to around 5% at the start of this century. Financial panics over this period did little to 
interrupt the downward trend.  
Events of the past two years have dramatically altered that picture. In relation to GDP, base 
money in the UK has risen by a factor of four – easily the highest financial crisis multiplier 
ever.8 It has reached a peak last witnessed almost two centuries ago. Past liquidity crises 
are foothills by comparison with recent Himalayan heights.  
Measures  of  central  bank  balance  sheet  expansion  under-estimate  the  scale  of  liquidity 
support provided during this crisis. As in Harman’s time, there has been a widening of the 
collateral taken by most central banks in their operations.9 The taking of imaginative forms of 
collateral has a history which predates central banking: in the 12th century, King Baldwin II of 
Jerusalem  secured  a  loan  using  his  beard  as  collateral.  Nonetheless,  recent  efforts  are 
probably unprecedented in scope. 
Collateral swaps, typically not involving beards but often requiring haircuts, have also played 
a significant role during this crisis. They too do not expand base money, but do liquefy banks’ 
balance sheets. And guarantees of wholesale liabilities have similarly served as an important 
liquidity insurance device for a number of countries. Together, these two instruments have 
totalled between 10% and 40% of GDP across the UK, US and euro-area.  
Plainly, there has been a dramatic expansion in both the scale and scope of state liquidity 
insurance to the banking system. This pattern has been repeated in the majority of recent 
systemic banking crises. In a study of 42 systemic banking crises between 1970 and 2007, 
Laeven  and  Valencia  find  peak  liquidity  provision  of  almost  30%  of  total  deposits.  Drastic 
times  clearly  call  for  drastic  measures.  Harman’s  description  of  last  resort  lending  in  1825

would not look out of place today. Except, crucially, the decimal point would have changed 
place. 
Deposit insurance and capital insurance have a shorter history. Deposit insurance was first 
introduced in the US in 1934, to protect retail depositors scorched by the experience of the 
Great Depression. It failed to catch on internationally. By the early 1960s, the US was still the 
only  developed  country  with  an  explicit  deposit  insurance  scheme.  Since  then,  there  has 
been  a  steady  rise  in  the  number  of  adopting  countries  (Chart  6).  By  2009,  almost  100 
countries globally had such a regime. 
Typically, the introduction and extension of deposit insurance regimes has been a response 
to banking crisis. This time’s crisis has been no exception. Australia and New Zealand have 
both introduced deposit guarantee schemes. And more than forty countries have increased 
the coverage limits of their existing schemes, including in the UK, US and Germany. In a few 
countries,  deposit  insurance  limits  have  temporarily  been  removed  –  for  example,  in 
Germany and Ireland. In many others, they have been removed implicitly.  
This, too, is a familiar pattern at crisis time. Laeven and Valencia find that coverage limits for 
deposit insurance schemes on average increase fourfold in relation to GDP after systemic 
crises.10 As with liquidity insurance, there has been a secular expansion in the scope and 
scale of deposit insurance.  
Finally, explicit capital insurance of the banking system appears to have been a more recent 
phenomenon. In the US, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was established in 1932 at 
the height of the Great Depression; it played a key role in recapitalising US banks through 
injections of preferred stock. More recently, recapitalisation of the banks has accompanied 
the banking crises in Scandinavia, Japan, Asia and Latin America. 
Historically,  capital  injections  into  the  UK  banking  system  have  tended  to  be  small  and 
bespoke  –  for  example,  at  the  time  of  the  secondary  banking  crisis  in  the  1970s  and  the 
small banks crisis in the early 1990s (Table 2).11 In terms of scale, capital injections during 
this crisis knock these interventions into a cocked hat. Once again, the decimal place has 
changed place. This pattern is replicated in studies of recent systemic banking crises. Since 
the  1970s,  capital  injections  to  the  banking  system  have  averaged  around  8%  of  GDP  at 
crisis time.12
Taken together, this evidence paints a consistent picture: a progressive rise in banking risk 
and  an  accompanying  widening  and  deepening  of  the  state  safety  net.  There  is a  ratchet. 
This ratchet is evidence of a policy time-consistency problem. 
Time-consistency and the banking safety net 
3.  
What  explains  this  time-inconsistency?  A  simple  framework  is  developed  to  explain  the 
existence  of,  and  ratchet  in,  the  safety  net.  It  focuses  on  the  incentive  structures  facing 
owners  of  banks  and  the  risk  strategies  they  pursue.  The  run-up  to  the  present  crisis 
provides several examples of those incentives and strategies at work.  
Take the payoff profile facing a bank shareholder. Assume that the sensitivity of the bank’s 
assets to aggregate risk – in the language of finance, its beta – equals 0.1. So for every 10% 
movement in the market as a whole, the bank’s assets move by 1%. Assume too that the 
beta of the bank’s deposits is zero and that the bank has an equity capital ratio of 10%. While 
arbitrary, these numbers are broadly plausible. Conveniently, under those assumptions the

beta of the bank’s equity equals one. Figure 1 shows the payoff profile facing owners of the 
bank.  
The  return  on  a  bank’s  equity  lies  on  a  45  degree  line  when  market  returns  are  positive. 
Gains to shareholders are potentially unlimited. But the same is not true in bad states of the 
world.  The  reason  is  limited  liability.  That  constrains  the  losses  of  shareholders  to  around 
zero.  Losses  beyond  that  point  are  borne  by  other  parts  of  banks’  capital  structure  – 
wholesale and retail depositors. Therein lies the problem. 
If protection of depositors is felt to be a public good, these losses instead risk being borne by 
the  state,  either  in  the  form  of  equity  injections  from  the  government  (capital  insurance), 
payouts  to  retail  depositors  (deposit  insurance)  or  liquidity  support  to  wholesale  funders 
(liquidity  insurance).  The  gains  risk  being  privatised  and  the  losses  socialised.  Evidence 
suggests this is a repeated historical pattern.  
Socialised losses are doubly bad for society. Taxes may not only be higher on average. They 
may also need to rise when they  are likely to be most painful to taxpayers, namely in the 
aftermath of crisis. So taxes profiles will be spiky rather than smooth and will spike when the 
chips are down. This is the opposite to what tax theory would tells us was optimal.13  
So far, so bad. But it is about to get worse, for this tells only half the story. This is a repeated 
game.  State  support  stokes  future  risk-taking  incentives,  as  owners  of  banks  adapt  their 
strategies  to  maximise  expected  profits.  So  it  was  in  the  run-up  to  the  present  crisis.  In 
particular, five such strategies were clearly in evidence: 
• 
Higher  leverage:  The  simplest  way  of  exploiting  the  asymmetry  of  payoffs  arising 
from limited liability is to increase leverage. For example, if the capital ratio of the 
hypothetical bank were to halve from 10% to 5%, the beta of the bank’s equity would 
double (Figure 2). In that event, the imbalance between privatised gains (above the 
zero  axis)  and  socialised  losses  (below  the  zero  axis)  would  increase.  Private 
investors would harvest more of the upside and export more of the downside. 
There is clear evidence of this strategy being pursued over long sweeps of history 
(Chart 2). Chart 7 looks at the behaviour of UK banks over the past decade; it plots 
their leverage against the riskiness of their assets. UK banks migrated North-West 
over the past ten years, with balance sheet expansion financed by higher leverage. 
Because UK and European banks were not subject to any regulatory restriction on 
simple leverage, there was no effective brake on this leverage-fuelled expansion. 
Higher leverage fully accounts for the rise in UK banks’ returns on equity up until 
2007. It also fully accounts for the subsequent collapse in these returns. The high-
leverage strategy pursued by UK and European banks rather effectively privatised 
gains and socialised losses. 
Higher  trading  assets:  An  alternative  means  of  replicating  the  effects  of  higher 
leverage is to increase the proportion of assets held in banks’ trading books. Trading 
assets are marked to market prices, thereby increasing their sensitivity to aggregate 
market fluctuations (beta). To illustrate, assume that a bank holds 90% of its assets 
in the banking book (with a beta of zero) and the remainder in the trading book (with 
a beta of one). That gives an asset beta of 0.1 and an equity beta of unity (Figure 1). 
But  if  the  size  of  the  trading  book  is  doubled  to  20%  of  assets,  this  doubles  the 
equity beta of the bank (Figure 2).  
Chart  8  plots  a  cross-section  of  global  banks’  trading  assets  as  a  fraction  of  their 
total assets against their leverage. It suggests that efforts to expand balance sheets 
through  higher  leverage  were  focussed  on  trading  assets.  In  the  first  part  of  this

it 
increases 
the  system’s  sensitivity 
decade,  rising  asset  prices  delivered  mark-to-market  gains  on  banks’  expanding 
trading assets. This boosted their profitability and returns on equity. As long as asset 
prices rose, this created an Alice in Wonderland world in which everybody had won 
and all had prizes. 
But when asset prices fell, reality returned. The same institutions suffered enormous 
mark-to-market trading book looses. Across global banks, trading book losses since 
the  start  of  the  crisis  total  over  $900bn.  In  a  number  of  cases,  these  losses 
necessitated  state  support.  Trading  book  expansion  also  allowed  banks  to  import 
the upside and export some of the downside. 
Business line diversification: A third strategy pursued by many financial institutions 
in  the  run-up  to  crisis  was  diversification  of  their  business  lines.  For  banks 
individually, this made sense. It helped reduce the idiosyncratic risk from individual 
business lines. Pre-crisis, this strategy seemed the epitomy of sound banking.  
In fact, it epitomised Keynes’ description of a sound banker: “one who, when he is 
ruined, is ruined in a conventional and orthodox way with his fellows, so that no-one 
can  really  blame  him”.14  Because,  for  risk  across  the  system  as  a  whole,  this 
strategy has systemically dangerous consequences. By increasing the similarity of 
banks’  asset  portfolios, 
to  aggregate 
fluctuations. Although diversification may purge idiosyncratic risk, it simultaneously 
reduces diversity and thereby increases systemic risk.15 It, too, increases the risk of 
adversity being socialised and prosperity privatised. 
High default assets: A fourth strategy for exploiting the asymmetry of equity payoffs 
is to originate assets which themselves have asymmetric returns. High risk loans are 
one example. These assets yield a high fixed payoff in good states of the world, but 
in  bad  states  default  generating  large  losses.  Because  losses  are  bunched  in  the 
tail, the result is that more of the gain is privatised and more of the loss socialised 
(Figure 3).  
This was the strategy pursued by US banks in the run-up to crisis. Unlike banks in 
Europe, US banks were effectively constrained from expanding their balance sheet 
by a regulatory leverage ratio. So instead they did the next worst thing: they sought 
higher return on equity by increasing the riskiness of their asset pool. This explains 
their venture into sub-prime and leveraged lending and various kinds of securitised 
exotica. 
Chart  9  looks  at  the  leverage  and  risk  positions  of  European  versus  US  banks. 
European banks lie in the North West, as they exploited the absence of a leverage 
constraint to expand their balance sheets in search of higher return on equity. US 
banks,  by  contrast,  located  themselves  in  the  South-East  with  lower  leverage  but 
higher risk per unit of assets. For US banks, this was a best response strategy for 
boosting shareholder payoffs. When risk on these high-default assets materialised, 
however,  the  result  was  the  same  as  for  European  banks  –  deep  losses,  often 
cushioned by the state. 
Out-of-the-money options: The payoffs to high-risk lending can be replicated using 
an  alternative  strategy  of  writing  deep  out-of-the-money  options.  This  can  be 
achieved, for example, by selling protection in the CDS market. The writer of that 
protection  receives  an  insurance  premium  and  thus  a  steady  source  of  income  in

good states of the world. Because of that, this strategy appears to generate “alpha” 
– excess returns – during the good times.  
In fact, this strategy is a wolf wrapped in sheep’s clothing; it is beta dressed up as 
alpha. In the event of a bad state of the world – default by the reference entity in a 
CDS  context  –  the  writers  of  the  insurance  suffer  a  significantly  negative  payoff, 
eliminating the apparent alpha earned in good states (Figure 3). This was, in effect, 
the  AIG  strategy.  AIG  is  believed  to  have  written  around  $1.0  trillion  of  CDS 
protection.  This  strategy  delivered  large  apparent  “alpha”  returns  during  the  disco 
years. But when the music ceased and true beta was revealed, AIG required state 
support of around $180bn. 
These  five  strategies  are  the  latest  incarnation  of  efforts  by  the  banking  system  to  boost 
shareholder returns and, whether by accident or design, game the state. For the authorities, 
it poses a dilemma. Ex-ante, they may well say “never again”. But the ex-post costs of crisis 
mean  such  a  statement  lacks  credibility.  Knowing  this,  the  rational  response  by  market 
participants is to double their bets. This adds to the cost of future crises. And the larger these 
costs, the lower the credibility of “never again” announcements. This is a doom loop. 
The “St Petersburg paradox” explains how a gambling strategy which starts small but then 
doubles-up  in  the  event  of  a  loss  can  yield  positive  (indeed,  potentially  infinite)  expected 
returns. Provided, that is, the gambler has the resources to double-up in the face of a losing 
streak.  The  St  Petersburg  lottery  has  many  similarities  with  the  game  played  between  the 
state and the banks over the past century or so. The banks have repeatedly doubled-up. And 
the  state  has  underwritten  any  losing  streak.  Clearer  practical  examples  of  a  policy  time-
consistency problem are unlikely to exist. 
Resolving the time-inconsistency problem 
4.  
In addressing this time-consistency problem, two broad approaches are possible: redesign of 
the financial system to reduce the scale of insurable risks; and redesign of the social safety 
net to make it less susceptible to gaming.  
Redesigning the financial system 
(a)  
What  options  best  tackle  excessive  risk-taking  incentives?  A  number  suggest  themselves, 
some modest, others more radical. 
• 
Introducing  leverage  limits:  One  simple  means  of  altering  the  rules  of  the 
asymmetric game between banks and the state is to place heavier restrictions on 
leverage. European banks were not subject to a regulatory leverage ratio in the run-
up to crisis. They exploited that loophole. Closing it would bring about a clockwise 
rotation  in  banks’  payoff  schedule,  lowering  the  beta  of  banks’  equity  returns  and 
reducing risk-taking incentives.  
This is an easy win. Simple leverage ratios already operate in countries such as the 
US  and  Canada.  They  appear  to  have  helped  slow  debt-fuelled  balance  sheet 
inflation.  The  Basel  Committee  is  now  seeking  to  introduce  leverage  ratios 
internationally. To be effective, it is important that leverage rules bite. They need to 
be robust to the seductive, but ultimately siren, voices claiming this time is different. 
That suggests they should operate as a regulatory rule (Pillar I), rather than being 
left to supervisory discretion (Pillar II).  
It is important, too, that leverage limits are set at the right level. Such limits need to 
be fundamentally re-evaluated. We have sleepwalked into a world in which leverage 
of 20 or 30 times capital is the rule rather than the exception. Now is a good time to 
wake up. Evidence from the not-too-distant past suggests there may be less to fear 
BIS Review 139/2009

  from materially higher capital ratios – say, a multiple of current ratios – than some 
would suggest (Chart 2). 
Recalibrating risk weights: With hindsight, the capital assigned to certain categories 
of high-risk and off balance sheet transactions by Basel rules was far too low. Those 
mis-calibrations were then arbitraged by the banks in ways which included inflated 
trading books and an over-expansion into high-risk loans and securitised assets. 
The  Basel  Committee  has  already  set  about  trying  to  correct  some  of  the  more 
obvious of these defects. For example, materially higher risk weights are set to be 
introduced  for  trading  book  assets  from  the  end  of  2010.  This  will  include, 
importantly,  securitised  and  re-securitised  products,  whose  payoffs  profiles  too 
closely  resembled  deep  out-of-the-money  options  (Figure  3).  New  risk  weights 
should better reflect the tail risk these products embody. 
These reforms will close a regulatory loophole and thereby lower the beta of, and 
hence systematic risk in, the banking system. They leave open some rather more 
fundamental  questions,  which  the  Basel  Committee  are  also  considering.  These 
include  whether  the  distinction  between  banking  and  trading  books,  and  the  re-
securitisation  of  assets,  are  necessary  in  the  first  place.  If  a  robust  financial  and 
regulatory system is one which is parsimonious and transparent, the answer might 
be that they are not. It may be time to take Occam’s razor to regulatory rulebooks.  
Rethinking capital structure: Asymmetry of payoffs risks excessive risk-taking. The 
source of this asymmetry is limited liability. It is revealing that limited liability was first 
introduced into banking in the UK in the mid-19th century. That was roughly the time 
state  support  for  banks  took  shape.  This  is  unlikely  to  have  been  serendipity.  So 
could the distortions from limited liability be tackled at source? 
In  the  early  days  of  banking,  liability  was  not  just  unlimited;  it  was  often  as  much 
personal as financial. In 1360, a Barcelona banker was executed in front of his failed 
bank,  presumably  as  a  way  of  discouraging  generations  of  future  bankers  from 
excessive risk-taking.16 It has not been conspicuously successful. From the Middle 
Ages, debtor prisons replaced the gallows. They were a common feature of many 
developed countries, including the US and UK, right up until the 19th century.  
The switch to limited liability at that time was a conscious attempt to encourage risk 
capital  into  the  banking  system  to  help  finance  growth.  In  essence,  this  meant 
trading  off  financial  risk  against  future  productivity.  At  first,  equity  in  banks  often 
carried “double liability”, with shareholders liable for losses on the purchase price of 
their shares plus their par value at issuance. Among state banks in the US during 
the  19th  and  early  20th  centuries,  double  liability  is  believed  to  have  helped 
constrain risk-taking.17  
This practice was ended at the time of the Great Depression in the US. Given the 
likely need to rebuild bank equity in the future, now may not be the time to return to 
unlimited  liability.  Fortunately,  there  are  two  alternative  approaches  to  adapting 
capital  structure  which  alter 
incentives,  without 
jeopardising  the  flow  of  risk  capital.  Both  involve  operating  not  on  equity,  but  on 
debt. And both involve making debt, like equity, a more loss-absorbing instrument in 
stress events. 
First, contingent capital is a means of automatically converting debt instruments into 
equity in the event of a capital top-up being needed. The capital structure of banks 
the  balance  of  risk-taking

 thereby  becomes  more  malleable.  There  has  been  recent  interest  in  contingent 
capital instruments as a means of providing banks with an extra degree of freedom 
in stress situations.18 The benefits in principle seem clear. The difficulties in practice 
include  whether  there  is  likely  to  be  sufficient  investor  demand  for  such  hybrid 
instruments.  
Second, wholesale debt instruments at present rank equally with retail deposits in 
the  UK  in  the  event  of  a  wind-up.  In  the  US,  depositor  preference  has  operated 
nationally since 1993, with retail deposits ranking ahead of wholesale debt. There 
are benefits to depositor preference both ex-ante (by heightening debtor incentives 
to monitor risk) and ex-post (by facilitating resolution). There are also some potential 
downsides, including causing unsecured creditors to run sooner. It may be a good 
time to reweigh these arguments in the UK.  
Reconsidering the industrial organisation of banking: Over the past few decades, the 
global banking system has evolved into a particular organisational form, with a small 
number  of  large  banks,  a  high  degree  of  concentration  and  relatively  low  rates  of 
entry and exit. Events of the past two years have accelerated these trends. In 1998, 
the five largest global banks had around 8% of global banking assets. By 2008, this 
fraction had doubled to around 16% (Chart 10).  
These  structural  trends  worsen  the  time-consistency  problem  for  the  authorities, 
increasing the pressure for state support to banks “too important to fail”. This has 
heightened  recent  interest  in  rethinking  the  industrial  organisation  of  finance.19 
There are a number of potential forms such a restructuring could take.20 In weighing 
these  options,  there  may  be  lessons  from  an,  on  the  face  of  it,  unlikely  corner  of 
finance: hedge funds. 
Hedge funds started this crisis in the doghouse. Yet they are the dog that has not 
barked. Their industrial structure may explain why. Unlike banking, the hedge fund 
sector does not comprise a small number of large players, but rather a large number 
of  relatively  small  players.  The  largest  hedge  funds  typically  have  assets  under 
management of less than $40bn, the largest banks assets in excess of $3 trillion.  
Unlike banking, concentration in the hedge fund sector is low and has been falling. 
The  top  5  hedge  funds  comprise  around  8%  of  total  assets,  down  from  30%  a 
decade  ago  (Chart  10).  Unlike  banking,  the  business  models  of  hedge  funds  are 
typically specialised rather than diversified. And unlike banking, entry and exit rates 
from  the  hedge  fund  industry  are  both  high.  The  annual  average  attrition  rate  for 
hedge funds is around 5%. At present, it is around double that. Among US banks, 
the average attrition rate over the past few decades has been less than 0.1%; it has 
not come close to hitting 5% at any point since the Great Depression.  
It  may  be  coincidence  that  the  structure  of  the  hedge  fund  sector  emerged  in  the 
absence  of  state  regulation  and  state  support.  It  may  be  coincidence  that  the 
majority  of  hedge  funds  operate  as  partnerships  with  unlimited  liability.  It  may  be 
coincidence that, despite their moniker of “highly-leveraged institutions”, most hedge 
funds today operate with leverage less than a tenth that of the largest global banks. 
Or  perhaps  it  might  be  that  the  structure  of  this  sector  delivered  greater  systemic 
robustness  than  could  be  achieved  through  prudential  regulation.  If  so,  that  is  an 
important lesson for other parts of the financial system.

• 
  Redesigning the safety net 
A framework for the banking safety net: Even with systemic risk reduced, the state is 
unlikely to be able credibly to stand aside when future tail risks eventuate, as they 
are  sure  to  do.  Some  bulwark  is  needed.  As  in  other  public  policy  arena,  a  pre-
defined and transparent regime can help reinforce the credibility of ex-post actions, 
serving as a pre-commitment device. 
At  present,  only  some  of  the  ingredients  of  such  an  ex-ante  framework  exist. 
Internationally, deposit insurance frameworks tend to be fairly well-defined; liquidity 
insurance  frameworks  somewhat  less  so.  Both  are  much  better  defined  than 
frameworks for capital insurance. A well-articulated framework for the banking safety 
net would not only provide greater clarity on each of these pieces. It would also set 
out interactions and interdependencies between them – when and how the different 
insurance strands  come  together  to  avert  crisis.  At  present,  no  such ex-ante  map 
exists.  Having  one  in  future  would  not  guarantee,  but  could  only  increase,  the 
chances of it being adhered to. 
Time-consistent  liquidity  insurance:  Almost  all  central  banks  have  flexed  their 
liquidity frameworks during the course of this crisis. And rightly so. In many cases, 
this  has  meant  a  combination  of  longer-maturity  lending  to  a  broader  range  of 
financial  institutions  against  a  wider  set  of  collateral.  Pre-crisis  liquidity  insurance 
frameworks  were  shown  during  crisis  to  lack  time-consistency.  How  can  we  best 
guard against a recurrence? 
Two elements are key. First, a greater degree of self-insurance by banks to lower 
the  probability  of  central  bank  resources  needing  to  be  drawn.  In  practice,  this 
means  that  liquidity  regulation  needs  to  be  tightened,  reversing  the  secular  fall  in 
liquidity  ratios  (Chart  3).  In  the  language  of  insurance,  the  excess  on  the  central 
bank  policy  needs  to  be  raised  materially.  The  FSA’s  proposed  new  liquidity 
regulation provides a good starting point.21  
Second, central bank liquidity insurance frameworks need explicitly to recognise the 
possibility  of  drastic  times  requiring  drastic  measures.  The  key  is  to  prevent  such 
drastic action becoming disorderly on the one hand, and permanent on the other.  
The first can be achieved by having a pre-defined framework which recognises the 
need for abnormal liquidity provision, whether in size, collateral quality or term. The 
second can be achieved by setting prices (fees and collateral haircuts) for liquidity 
provision which discourage abnormalities from becoming regularities. The Bank of 
England’s  new  sterling  monetary  framework,  announced  last  October,  seeks  to 
apply those principles in practice.22
Time-consistent deposit insurance: Deposit insurance schemes have been stretched 
in many countries, to the point of offering blanket coverage of retail deposits. Those 
actions  are  already  damping  the  risk  senses  of  depositors,  who  have  rationally 
reacted  by  seeking  out  the  highest-yielding  accounts.  This  has  contributed  to  a 
competitive frenzy in the retail deposit market. In the UK, retail deposit rates have 
risen over the past year from 100 basis points below base rate to 100 basis points 
above. 
In general insurance markets, distorted risk choices are guarded against by sharing 
the risk between insurer and insuree, ex-ante (through risk-based premia) or ex-post 
(through  co-insurance  devices).  Deposit  insurance  regimes  in  some,  but  not  all, 
                                                 
21   FSA (2009).

 BIS Review 139/2009
 countries  have  such  features.  In  the  UK,  deposit  insurance  premia  are  not  risk-
based.  Private  risk  incentives  would  be  better  aligned  with  the  public  good  if  the 
UK’s deposit insurance regime had such a feature. 
Time-consistent  capital  insurance:  In  historical  terms,  capital  insurance  to  the 
banking system is the newest of the state support mechanisms for banks. Partly for 
that reason, its framework is least well advanced. Indeed, give or take, there is no 
framework at present. 
Whether one is needed will depend importantly on the levels of private capital held in future 
by the banking system – the degree of self-insurance. That debate has some distance still to 
travel.  But  there  are  complementary  measures  which  could  serve  a  similar  purpose.  For 
example, some academics have proposed private sector capital insurance schemes, funded 
ex-ante by levies on banks.23 So too have some policymakers.24 These schemes are similar 
in many respects with existing deposit insurance regimes. Like them, such schemes would 
ideally set risk-based premia and be pre-funded to ensure they were time-consistent. 
One  potential  benefit  of  private  sector  contingent  capital  proposals  are  that  they  allow  a 
mutualisation of risk. This lowers the aggregate pool of capital that might be needed by the 
banking system. If this pool of capital is large enough to accommodate future crisis needs, 
private sector capital insurance may offer a better cost/risk trade-off than self-insurance. As 
history  shows,  however,  this  is  a not  inconsiderable  “if”. Further  work  would  be needed  to 
establish what size insurance scheme would genuinely augment the capital pool. 
Conclusion 
5.  
Over the course of the past 800 years, the terms of trade between the state and the banks 
have first swung decisively one way and then the other. For the majority of this period, the 
state was reliant on the deep pockets of the banks to finance periodic fiscal crises. But for at 
least  the  past  century  the  pendulum  has  swung  back,  with  the  state  often  needing  to  dig 
deep to keep crisis-prone banks afloat. 
Events of the past two years have tested even the deep pockets of many states. In so doing, 
they have added momentum to the century-long pendulum swing. Reversing direction will not 
be easy. It is likely to require a financial sector reform effort every bit as radical as followed 
the Great Depression. It is an open question whether reform efforts to date, while slowing the 
swing, can bring about that change of direction.
