Philipp Hildebrand: The Swiss National Bank’s monetary policy strategy 
in the financial crisis 
Summary  of  a  speech  by  Mr  Philipp  Hildebrand,  Chairman  of  the  Governing  Board  of  the 
Swiss National Bank, at the University of St. Gallen, St. Gallen, 23 March 2010. 
The complete text in German can be found on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 To  contain  the  financial  crisis,  central  banks  all  over  the  world  have  chosen  to  take 
advantage of the room for manoeuvre afforded by their monetary policy strategy. The major 
central  banks  were  only  able  to  act  in  a  flexible  way  –  at  least  in  part  –  due  to  their  high 
degree of credibility with regard to their goal of pursuing price stability. The monetary policy 
strategy  of  the  Swiss  National  Bank  (SNB),  too,  has  made  it  possible  for  the  Governing 
Board to take conventional and unconventional measures to counter the crisis.  
The SNB’s approach has proven viable in the crisis. But this does not mean that we can sit 
back now. We must first find ways to withdraw smoothly from the measures taken to contain 
the crisis. In addition, we need to be sure that the Swiss economy is back on a sustainable 
growth path. After all, the crisis has shown that imbalances in the global financial system can 
occur even in an environment of price stability and macroeconomic stability. 
The  main  way  to  counter  imbalances  in  the  financial  system  is  through  better  regulation. 
Furthermore, central banks should seriously consider the question of whether they need to 
intervene when risks in the financial system increase as a result of strong credit growth and 
an  easing  of  lending  conditions.  Credit  aggregates  are  part  of  the  SNB’s  monetary  policy 
strategy,  and  the  National  Bank  monitors  their  development  closely.  However,  the  SNB’s 
main aim is and will continue to be the maintenance of price stability.
