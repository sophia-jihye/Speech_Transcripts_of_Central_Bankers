Introduction 
Esteemed  Shareholders,  Distinguished  Guests  and  Members  of  the  Press, 
Welcome to the 78th Ordinary Meeting of the General Assembly of the Central Bank 
of the Republic of Turkey. 
I would like to start my speech with a brief evaluation of the global financial crisis 
that deepened to spread over the whole world in the final quarter of 2008 and took 
its  toll  throughout  2009.  Later  on,  I  will  summarize  the  key  macroeconomic 
developments that took place in Turkey in 2009. Finally, I will share my evaluations 
pertaining to inflation developments and monetary policy implementations.

The  effects  of  the  financial  crisis,  which  first  started  in  advanced  countries  and 
deepened mainly due to the bankruptcy of some major financial firms in the USA in 
September  2008,  continued  to  dominate  financial  markets  throughout  2009. 
Accordingly,  growth  rates  slumped  globally  but  particularly  in  advanced  countries. 
Owing  to  extensive  liquidity  operations  led  by  central  banks  and  large-scale 
government  interventions,  the  effects  of  the  crisis  started  to  subside  as  of  the 
second half of 2009 and the global economy exhibited signs of a slow and gradual 
recovery.  
The recovery in global economic activity that started on the back of the historically 
large fiscal stimulus packages launched by advanced economies contributed to the 
improvement  of  global  risk  perceptions  and  normalization  of  financial  markets. 
Readings  on  economic  activity  and  global  financial  system  in  the  first  quarter  of 
2010  point  out  that  the  recovery  is  ongoing.  However,  soaring  budget  deficits  
–  especially  in  advanced  economies  –  reach  levels  of  concern,  problems  across 
credit  markets  linger,  and  unemployment  rates  continue  to  remain  elevated,  all 
suggesting  that  it  would  take  a  long  time  for  the  global  economic  problems  to  be 
resolved permanently. Moreover, ongoing uncertainties regarding the exit strategies 
from  unconventional  monetary  and  fiscal  measures  continue  to  pose  risks  on  the 
sustainability of the recovery.  
It is observed that advanced and emerging market economies started to recover as 
of the second quarter of 2009, mainly on the back of expansionary monetary and 
fiscal  policies  implemented  worldwide  and  on  inventory  accumulation  mostly  in 
advanced economies. Despite positive signs of recovery in the global economy, high 
unemployment rates in advanced countries, primarily in the USA and Euro Area, still 
persist. With global economic growth mainly based on expansionary monetary and 
fiscal  policies  temporary  in  nature  and  the  fact  that  unemployment  rates  remain 
currently  high  and  oil  prices  re-started  rallying,  the  global  economic  recovery  will 
likely to be slow and protracted.

Commodity  prices,  which  fell  drastically  in  the  last  quarter  of  2008  due  to  the 
significant  contraction  in  global  economic  activity,  hovered  at  low  levels  in  early 
2009. However, commodity prices began trending upward as of the second half of 
the  year  mainly  on  the  back  of  the  growing  optimism  about  the  global  economic 
recovery and the boosting demand stimulated by the fiscal incentives implemented 
in  China.  The  liquidity  glut  that  was  particularly  fuelled  by  stimulus  packages 
implemented  in  advanced  countries,  and  the  accelerating  global  economic  activity 
resulted in an increase in oil and commodity prices, which further continued into the 
first quarter of 2010 as well.

 Global  inflation  that  had  plummeted  due  to  downward  pressures  arising  from 
demand and cost conditions since the second half of 2008, maintained its course in 
2009  as  well,  and  the  annual  rate  of  change  in  consumer  prices  in  advanced 
economies  turned  negative  in  May  and  June.  However,  it  started  to  trend  up  in

 August 2009, particularly due to the low base in 2008 and the surge in commodity 
prices.  The  upward  trend  in  global  inflation,  being  more  pronounced  in  emerging 
economies,  also  continued  into  early  2010.  Meanwhile,  core  inflation  continued  to 
decline in advanced economies, while it trended upward in emerging economies.

In  the  first  half  of  2009,  the  global  financial  markets  recovered,  albeit  modestly 
relative  to  the  final  quarter  of  2008  when  the  impact  of  the  crisis  was  felt  most 
strongly. This recovery is mainly attributable to measures taken worldwide in order 
to ensure the proper functioning of financial markets, unconventional monetary and 
fiscal measures taken by advanced countries and the relatively promising data on 
global  economic  activity.  The  global  risk  appetite  continued  to  improve,  though 
slowly, as of the year-end and early 2010.

The rate cut cycle that was initiated by the central banks of both advanced and the 
emerging countries at the height of the global crisis during the final quarter of 2008, 
continued in the first quarter of 2009, albeit with less pace. Monetary easing cycle in 
advanced  economies,  which  significantly  slowed  down  in  the  second  quarter  of 
2009, ceased completely in the third quarter. Emerging market central banks, on the 
other hand, continued to cut policy rates at a reduced pace to contain the impact of 
the global crisis on economic activity. 
As of year-end, most central banks kept policy rates at low levels and continued to 
implement  expansionary  monetary  policy  to  stimulate  economic  activity  by  using 
unconventional monetary policy tools. In the first quarter of 2010, a limited number 
of central banks tightened their monetary policy stance by increasing policy rates, 
while most of them kept their rates unchanged at low levels. In the meantime, these 
central  banks  started 
the  expansionary  monetary  policy 
implementations, which are conducted by the use of unconventional policy tools.

After having summarized developments in the global economy in 2009, now I would 
like to touch upon key macroeconomic developments in Turkey.

 Developments in the Turkish economy 
As  I  have  already  mentioned  regarding  the  global  economic  developments,  the 
growing perception since the last quarter of 2009 that the worst of the crisis is over 
and the economy has started to head towards recovery has driven the global risk 
appetite  higher.  This  boosted  optimism  in  global  financial  markets  and provided  a 
further  positive  bias  towards  riskier  assets.  Thus,  emerging  markets,  including 
Turkey, have experienced capital inflows through portfolio movements, which led to 
an appreciation in their currencies and caused stock markets to rise.

However, an important point that needs to be highlighted is that risk indicators for 
the  Turkish  economy  have  exhibited  a  more  favorable  performance  compared  to 
that  of  other  emerging  market  economies  especially  since  the  height  of  the  crisis 
during the final quarter of 2008. This development not only implies the soundness of 
the  Turkish  financial  structure,  but  also  indicates  that  our  economy  has  gained 
resilience and strength against global crises compared to previous periods.  
Turkey’s CDS rating changed dramatically at the end of 2009. Medium to long-term 
forecasts for Turkey were revised positively, many investors increased the weight of 
Turkish  assets  in  their  portfolios,  and  more  importantly,  prominent  credit-rating 
agencies  upgraded  Turkey’s  credit  rating.  There  may  be  some  credit  upgrades  in 
the  upcoming  period,  in  case  a  fiscal  discipline  backed  by  structural  reforms  is 
achieved and maintained.

The higher performance exhibited by the Turkish economy compared to many other 
emerging economies during the global crisis and the recent upgrades to our credit 
rating are mainly attributable to the stability ensured in our financial system. Unlike 
its peers, Turkey did not require any cash stimulus packages for its banking system 
against the global financial crisis. The absence of toxic assets in banking balance 
sheets,  strong  capital  adequacy  ratios  and  considerably  low  levels  of  foreign 
exchange  short  positions  have  been  the  essentials  underlying  the  increased 
strength of our financial system against the global crisis.

With  the  problems  driven  by  global  turbulence,  the  domestic  and  foreign  credit 
conditions  in  Turkey  tightened  and  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP)  growth  rates 
have  slowed  down  significantly  since  the  second  quarter  of  2008  as  a  result  of 
narrowing domestic demand. Economic activity has experienced hard landings from 
the last quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009. As the monetary and fiscal 
measures started to sway, the GDP, after bottoming out, started to recover rapidly 
as of the second quarter and contracted by 4.7 percent for the overall year. While 
private 
investment  and  consumption  expenditures  had  a  negative  effect, 
government spending on consumption goods had a boosting effect on GDP growth 
in 2009. Meanwhile, the positive contribution of the increased net exports as a result 
of the reduced demand for imports partially limited the slowdown of growth in 2009.

The transformation that the Turkish economy has undergone in the post-2001 period 
has  caused  major  changes  in  the  employment  structure.  The  share  of  the 
agricultural  sector  in  employment  was  35  percent  in  2002,  while,  this  ratio  fell  to 
around 23 percent in 2007. However, with the recent economic slowdown, this trend 
reversed temporarily and the share of agricultural sector in employment increased to 
approximately 25 percent in 2009. 
While global turmoil took a heavy toll on industrial employment, it had a scant impact 
on employment in construction and services sectors. In 2009, industrial employment 
contracted  by  7  percent,  whereas,  employment  in  the  construction  sector  and 
services sector increased by 0.6 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively.

Demographic changes in Turkey leads to an increase in the share of the working 
population in the overall population and this, in turn, results in the unemployment to 
persist. However, the recent upsurge in the unemployment rate is mainly attributable 
to cyclical rather than structural factors. The economic contraction in 2009 increased 
the labor force participation rate while significantly curbing the pace of employment 
growth; hence the unemployment rate increased rapidly.  
BIS Review 68/2010

20. 
21. 
The labor force is comprised of 23,8 million people in 2008 and rose to 24.7 million 
people  in  2009  by  an  increase  of  4  percentage  points,  whereas,  employment 
increased  by  a  mere  0.4  percent,  from  21.2  million  to  21.3  million  people.  In  this 
period,  the  rapid  increase  in  labor  force  participation  while  employment  remained 
much the same, caused the unemployment rate to climb to 14 percent in 2009 from 
11  percent  in  2008.  Meanwhile,  the  non-farm  unemployment  rate  increased  from 
13.6 percent to 17.4 percent.  
As 
in  my  previous  presentations,  creating  new  employment 
opportunities for the growing labor supply in Turkey is contingent upon carrying out 
cost-reducing and resilience-enhancing reforms in labor markets. These reforms, by 
promoting registered employment, will also help us overcome problems in our social 
security system.

The impact of the global economic crisis on Turkey’s foreign trade has been evident, 
and the contraction in domestic and foreign demand and the slumps in commodity 
prices, especially in crude oil as well as iron and steel led imports and exports to 
shrink rapidly as of the last quarter of 2008. Significant declines have been observed 
throughout  the  year  in  imports  and  exports,  which  tended  to  recover  as  of  the 
second  quarter  of  2009  as  signs  of  revival  in  global  economic  activity  appeared. 
Total exports of goods fell by 22.1 percent to 109.7 billion USD, while total imports 
of  goods  fell  by  30.7  percent  year-on-year  to  134.4  billion  USD  in  2009. 
Consequently, the foreign trade deficit, which was 53 billion USD in 2008, dropped 
to 24.7 billion USD in 2009. 
The  adverse  impact  of  the  global  crisis  on  tourism  revenues  was  translated  as  a 
decrease in expenditures. In 2009, tourism revenues decreased by 3.2 percent. The 
said decline is mainly attributable to the fall in average tourism revenues. In fact, the 
number of visitors increased by 3.3 percent in 2009. Due to the recovery in other 
services  items,  the  slowdown  in  the  services  surplus  remained  limited  at  5.3 
percent. Hence, the current account deficit has been 13.9 billion USD in 2009, while 
the  ratio  of  current  account  deficit  to  GDP  fell  from  5.6  percent  in  2008  to  2.2 
percent in 2009.

Uncertainties led by the global crisis adversely affected the credit market in Turkey 
as well. On the supply side, 2009 is evaluated as a year in which the banks were 
cautious  in  lending  basically  due  to  risk  perceptions.  On  the  demand  side,  the 
demand  for  investment  loans  has  been  on  a  decline  because  of  the  slowdown  in 
economic  activity.  On  the  other  hand,  the  willingness  of  firms  to  restructure  their 
debts emerged as a significant factor that increased credit demand.

Measures taken by the Central Bank to maintain financial stability and to promote 
the functionality of credit markets had favorable impacts on credit markets during the 
crisis.  Policy  rate  cuts  and  stabilizing  liquidity  measures  were  reflected  on  credit 
rates and this contributed to the easing of financial tightness. Especially as of the 
second  half  of  2009,  with  the  decline  in  credit  rates,  the  uptrend  in  credit  volume 
became more pronounced.

The comprehensive fiscal incentive policies implemented to alleviate the effects of 
the global economic crisis caused fiscal deficits and debts stocks to soar globally, 
primarily in advanced countries. Additionally, the decline in tax revenues consequent 
to the contraction in economic activity accelerated the increase in budget deficits. 
In  parallel  with  the  global  rise  in  government  fiscal  balances,  the  ratios  of  budget 
deficits and debt stocks to national income also soared in Turkey in 2009. During

this period, lower-than-targeted tax revenues due to contraction in domestic demand 
as  well  as  higher-than-targeted  primary  expenditures  mainly  due  to  increase  in 
current  transfers  to  Social  Security  Institution  due  to  slowdown  in  employment 
growth have been the primary causes of the surge in the budget deficit. An analysis 
of developments in public finance in the first quarter of 2010 reveals that the central 
government budget balance had an improved year-on-year performance, this being 
mainly  attributable  to  the  increase  in  tax  revenues  with  the  revival  in  economic 
activity.

The determined implementation of fiscal discipline in Turkey since 2002 has helped 
cut the ratios of government budget deficit and debt to GDP, to a level well below 
the average of both advanced and emerging economies. Although Turkey’s budget 
deficit expanded at a faster pace than in many other emerging economies in 2009, 
according to the MTP projections, government debt stock is likely to remain below 
the average of other emerging economies in the upcoming years.

Under  current  economic  circumstances,  in  order  to  reinforce  the  optimism  about 
sustainable  macroeconomic  stability  in  the  medium  term  and  to  ensure  effective 
expectations  management,  it  is  crucial  that  government  budget  deficit  and  debt 
should  be  kept  under  control  through  commitments  with  a  strong  institutional 
background.  In  this  regard,  attaining  the  targets  set  out  in  the  MTP  through 
institutional and structural improvements rather than by tax and price adjustments, is 
critical for further enhancing gains already achieved in terms of country risk.

In the last part of my speech, I would like to mention the monetary policy strategy 
that  we  implemented  in  this  atmosphere  of  uncertainty  created  by  the  global 
economic crisis. I will, first of all, give an evaluation on inflation developments and 
monetary policy implementations within the scope of the inflation targeting regime. 
Then, I will briefly touch upon the exit strategy, the details of which were shared with 
the public last week, for gradually withdrawing measures taken during extraordinary 
circumstances.

Inflation developments and monetary policy implementations 
As I have also mentioned at the beginning of my speech when evaluating the global 
economic developments, inflation rates saw dramatic declines on a global basis due 
to rapidly contracting economic activity and plunging commodity prices as of the last 
quarter of 2008. During this period, a similar pace was observed in Turkey regarding 
the inflation outlook. Despite the relatively sound structure of the Turkish financial 
sector,  our  exports  being  composed  of  mainly  products  sensitive  to  foreign 
conjuncture; the sensitivity of production to global credit conditions and high level of 
capacity  at  the  onset  of  the  crisis  have  deepened  the  contraction  in  economic 
activity.  During  this  period,  in  addition  to  tightness  in  financial  conditions,  a  sharp 
contraction in domestic demand was also experienced due to prevailing perception 
of  uncertainty  and  increased  precautionary  savings.  Furthermore,  temporary  tax 
incentives  for  stimulating  the  domestic  demand  led  inflation  to  fall  faster-than-
BIS Review 68/2010

expected in the first half of 2009. Consequently, the inflation rate remained below 
the announced target-consistent-path, in June. 
As  I  have  previously  mentioned,  as  the  pace  of  recovery  in  the  global  economy 
became  more  pronounced,  the  risk  appetite  in  global  financial  markets  started  to 
boost as of the second half of 2009. Accordingly, emerging markets attracted more 
capital through increased portfolio movements. On the Turkish economy side, this 
led  to  appreciation  of  the  Turkish  lira  against  major  currencies,  which  limited  the 
adverse  effect  of  import  price  hikes  on  unit  costs.  In  the  third  quarter  of  2009, 
despite  the  upward  inflationary  pressure  from  tax  adjustments  to  restore  fiscal 
balance,  the  annual  rate  of  change  in  consumer  prices  maintained  its  downward 
pace due to declining course of the underlying trend. By the end of the third quarter, 
the inflation rate continued to remain below the target-consistent-path.

 In the last quarter of 2009, in line with our projections, both domestic and external 
demand, one of the factors that affect the underlying inflation trend, maintained their 
pace  of  moderate  recovery,  and  resource  utilization  in  the  economy  continued  to 
remain  low.  Yet,  inflation  was  up  by  1  percentage  point  from  October  Inflation 
Report  projections  due  to  the  highest  increase  in  unprocessed  food  prices  of  the 
recent past. Consequently, inflation remained slightly below the target at end-2009 
with 6.53 percent, yet remained within the uncertainty band. 
An analysis of inflation developments in 2009 by subcategories suggests that annual 
inflation slowed down in all main categories excluding food and energy for which tax 
adjustments  were  effective.  Although  food  price  inflation  remained  low  relative  to 
recent years, among all subcategories, the biggest contributor to overall inflation has 
been food prices. This is attributable to hikes in unprocessed food prices driven by 
supply-side shocks.

Despite  having  followed  a  volatile  course  during  periods  when  temporary  tax 
adjustments were effective, core inflation, which is useful for predicting underlying 
inflation,  had  a  remarkable  downtrend  consistent  with  medium-term  targets 
throughout 2009.

Recent  data  releases  indicate  that  the  pace  of  recovery  in  economic  activity 
continues.  Domestic  demand  rises  gradually  as  the  lagged  effects  of  monetary 
policy  implementations  become  evident,  whereas,  uncertainties  regarding  external 
demand  persist.  Accordingly,  we  expect  that  after  following  a  volatile  course 
significantly above the target for some period, inflation will be back on a downtrend 
by the phasing out of temporary effects as of the last quarter of the year and return 
to target-consistent levels as of early 2011. At this point, I would like to emphasize 
that we closely monitor pricing behavior as inflation hovers around high levels, albeit 
for a temporary period. I would like to hereby remind you that we will provide public 
with the updated evaluations and forecasts on medium-term inflation outlook along 
with possible risks and policy measures, more extensively in the Inflation Report to 
be published on 29 April.

Throughout  2009,  as  the  Central  Bank,  we  focused  on  policies  oriented  towards 
containing the adverse effects of the crisis on the economic activity and on financial 
stability while also overseeing price stability. Thanks to the experience gained from 
domestic  crises  in  the  recent  past,  we  were  able  to  make  prompt  and  effective 
decisions, thus we were able to do our part to minimize the adverse impacts of the 
global crisis. In this period, the soundness of the financial system in addition to the 
relatively limited deterioration in the risk premium provided monetary policy with an 
extra room for maneuver. 
Accordingly, envisioning that undershooting the inflation target at year-end has been 
more likely, we continued the rate cut cycle that we initiated in November 2008 by 
pursuing  a  front-loaded  monetary  policy  in  early  2009.  Despite  signals  of  partial 
recovery  in  domestic  economic  activity  as  of  May,  we  continued  rate  cuts  until 
November 2009 in view of the ongoing uncertainties pertaining to the strength and 
sustainability  of  the  demand  recovery  and  also  anticipating  that  it  would  take  a 
considerable  period  of  time  before  economic  activity  recovers  and  employment 
conditions would improve. The policy rate cuts were terminated in December 2009, 
due to stronger perceptions that economic activity had started to recover. Thus, the 
policy rates were cut by a total of 1025 basis points since November 2008.

 the  effectiveness  of  the  monetary  policy  decisions  on  financial  variables  and 
expectations.  Consequently,  in  2009,  determining  role  of  Central  Bank  in  shaping 
market interest rates has improved and hence, market interest rates came down to 
historic lows by following the monetary policy stance even during periods marked by 
high global risk perceptions. Furthermore, we observe that our policy rate cuts have 
also been effective on credit rates as of the second half of 2009. The downtrend in 
credit interest rates especially accelerated further following the issue of July Inflation 
Report which presented a solid perspective on medium-term policy, and on the back 
of  the  improvement  in  global  risk  perceptions,  credit  markets  have  witnessed 
favorable developments as of the last quarter of 2009.

We  effectively  used  all  policy  instruments  to  maintain  financial  stability  during  the 
height  of  the  crisis.  As  the  crisis  began  to  deepen  in  October  2008,  we,  by 
establishing a strong line of communication with the public about the details and the 
robust  structure  of  the  liquidity  management  strategy,  have  announced  liquidity 
facilities to be provided to the markets step-by-step, in a clear and transparent way. 
Subsequently,  by  gradually  introducing  the  announced  measures  for  both  Turkish 
lira and foreign exchange markets, we considerably removed the disturbances and 
volatilities in the markets. In this regard, we continued to implement measures that 
were taken as of October 2008 – when the crisis started to deepen – for ensuring 
smooth operation of Turkish lira and foreign exchange markets and supporting the 
corporate sector, in 2009 as well. In this part of my speech, I would like to outline the 
measures that we have taken. 
The  monetary  measures  implemented  for  Turkish  lira  during  the  crisis  can  be 
classified  into  two  main  groups:  The  first  pillar  of  monetary  measures  was  the 
implementations to ease the uncertainties in money markets caused by the crisis. In 
this regard, as of October 2008, we started to inject liquidity excessively in order to 
reduce potential tension in money markets and to completely eliminate volatility in 
overnight interest rates. However, at this point, I would like to remind you that the 
excess  liquidity  generated  as  a  result  of  the  implementation  which  was  continued 
throughout 2009, was sterilized by overnight operations at the end of the day.

flexibility  and 
to  maintain  operational 
The  second  pillar  of  the  monetary  measures  was  the  arrangements  we  made  to 
support  the  credit  markets  in  view  of  the  permanent  decline  in  liquidity.  In  this 
regard,  as  a  result  of  the  increasing  net  liquidity  shortage  in  the  market  and  the 
possibility  that  this  shortage  may  become  permanent,  the  Central  Bank  started  to 
hold 3-month repo auctions as of June in order to support the smooth operation of 
the  credit  mechanism.  In  October  2009,  as  it  became  evident  that  the  liquidity 
shortage has been permanent, Turkish lira required reserve ratio was reduced from 
6 percent to 5 percent in order to support the credit mechanism. 
Furthermore,  irrespective  of  these  measures,  we  started  to  purchase  government 
securities from the secondary markets at the end of 2009 on technical grounds in 
order 
liquidity 
management.  Accordingly,  as  of  April  15,  we  have  injected  3.1  billion  TL  to  the 
market against government securities with a nominal value of 3.2 billion TL through 
pre-scheduled  auctions.  I  would  like  to  underline  that  even  though  the  outright 
purchases of government securities coincided with the crisis period, it has no direct 
relationship with the crisis.  
In  order  to  support  foreign  exchange  liquidity  and  ensure  smooth  operation  of  FX 
markets,  in  February  2009,  the  Central  Bank  extended  the  maturity  of  foreign 
exchange deposits denominated in US dollar or Euro for banks in the FX Deposit 
Markets, and lending rate was reduced for transactions where the Central Bank is 
counterpart.  Moreover,  upon  observing  unhealthy  pricing  in  the  foreign  exchange 
markets as a result of vanishing depth, 18 foreign exchange selling auctions were 
held between 10 March-2 April 2009 and 900 million USD was sold in total. 
With  the  aim  of  supporting  the  corporate  sector  and  widening  the  use  of  export 
discount credits, arrangements were introduced in March and April, larger number of 
firms was granted access to export discount credits and credit limits were raised.

Recently, one of the most debated issues with respect to monetary policy is the “exit 
strategies”, which entail withdrawal of measures taken during the global crisis and 
provide normalization of operations for monetary policies. Many central banks have 
been working on exit strategies for quite a long time as the adverse effects of the 
crisis  diminish  and  signals  of  economic  recovery  grow  stronger  with  the  ultimate 
goal to prepare markets for the normalization process. Obviously, each central bank 
will  form  its  own  exit  strategy  according  to  country-specific  conditions  such  as 
improvements in financial markets, degree of economic recovery and the severity of 
inflationary  pressure.  With  its  very  strong  and  well-regulated  banking  system 
coupled  with  its  flexible,  effective  and  fit-for-every-condition  liquidity  management 
framework  based  on  its  past  experience  from  several  crises,  Turkey  was  well 
prepared for the global crisis. These factors reduced the need for the Central Bank 
to take additional radical measures, and the Central Bank’s balance sheet structure 
did not deteriorate during the crisis. Hence, the Central Bank’s exit strategy will be 
simpler  and  easier  as  compared  to  many  central  banks.  Yet,  owing  to  the 
importance that we attach to transparency and predictability, we informed the public 
about the general framework of our exit strategy in our Press Release of 14 April 
2010, before putting the strategy into practice.  
Accordingly,  taking  account  of  the  recent  developments  and  the  normalization  in 
both  money  and  credit  markets;  we  plan  to  gradually  withdraw  some  of  the 
measures taken in the foreign exchange and Turkish lira markets during the crisis. 
Hence, measures taken for crisis management will be withdrawn first and the exit 
strategy in  Turkey, like elsewhere, will be a strategy that is cautious, gradual and

safeguarding financial stability. I would like to repeat that you can find the details of 
our exit strategy in our press release of 14 April 2010. 
In the last part of my speech, I would briefly like to mention our foreign exchange 
policy. As you may well know, we have been implementing floating exchange rate 
regime  since  2001  and  exchange  rates  are  determined  by  supply  and  demand 
conditions  in  the  market.  However,  we  can  directly  intervene  in  the  markets  by 
selling or buying foreign exchange in case of any unhealthy price formation, which is 
driven by a vanishing market depth, is observed. Yet, I would like to remind you that 
we have not directly intervened in the market after our last direct selling intervention 
during the global financial turbulence in May-June 2006 period. 
The  second  pillar  of  the  floating  exchange  rate  regime  is  the  foreign  exchange 
buying auctions held for accumulating reserves. We hold foreign exchange buying 
auctions in line with a pre-announced schedule in order to minimize the impact of 
the auctions on supply and demand conditions, and strive not to make any changes 
on this schedule unless extraordinary changes occur in foreign exchange liquidity. 
The foreign exchange buying auctions, which were suspended in October 2008 to 
enable banks to strengthen their foreign exchange liquidity positions amidst global 
crisis  conditions,  were  resumed  on  August  4,  2009  on  the  back  of  the  increased 
liquidity and stronger risk appetite and relatively stabilized foreign exchange market 
fuelled  by  favorable  expectations  about  the  global  economy.  Accordingly,  the  net 
amount of foreign exchange purchased in 2009 was 3.4 billion USD and the gross 
foreign exchange reserves reached 69.6 billion USD by the end of 2009.

In sum, the developments since the last quarter of 2008 demonstrated that inflation 
targeting is a flexible strategy that enables a timely response to economic shocks. 
Recent experiences have clearly confirmed that the Central Bank, when necessary, 
can focus on sudden slumps in growth and employment driven by external factors 
provided  that  this  does  not  conflict  with  its  objective  of  price  stability.  In  the 
upcoming  periods,  we  will  continue  to  focus  on  establishing  price  stability 
permanently, acting in the light of our past experience and with the awareness of our 
increased  credibility.  I  would  like  to  hereby  underline  the  importance  of  economic

units  to  closely  monitor  our  future-oriented  messages  rather  than  short-term 
developments, for the sustainability of monetary policy gains during the crisis. 
As of the last quarter of 2008, we focused on containing the unfavorable impact of 
the global crisis on the domestic economic activity without undermining the primary 
objective  of  maintaining  price  stability  and  largely  did  our  share  in  this  respect.  A 
prudent  monetary  policy  is  necessary,  but  not  sufficient  by  itself  to  maintain  the 
resilience  of  the  economy  against  global  risk.  Strengthening  the  commitment  to 
fiscal  discipline  and  the  structural  reform  agenda  is  crucial  for  supporting  the 
favorable outcomes of monetary policy decisions and maintaining low interest rates. 
In this respect, timely implementation of the structural reforms both entailed in the 
harmonization and convergence process to European Union and also in the Medium 
Term Program remains critically important. Therefore, I would like to end my speech 
by reminding that we will continue to closely monitor public finance developments 
while determining our medium term monetary policy strategies.  
Thank you.
