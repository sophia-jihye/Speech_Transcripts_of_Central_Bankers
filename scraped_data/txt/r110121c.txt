Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile: Bank of Uganda’s position on the 
exchange rate 
Statement  by  Prof  Emmanuel  Tumusiime-Mutebile,  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Uganda, 
Kampala, 19 January 2011. 
 I think that it is now necessary to state clearly Bank of Uganda’s position on the Exchange 
Rate. 
We believe that the current level of the Uganda Shilling/Dollar exchange rate is undervalued. 
Moreover,  further  depreciation  will  be  counterproductive  for  macroeconomic  management, 
especially because of the impact this will have on the prices of imported goods and hence on 
consumer price inflation. 
Consequently, the Bank of Uganda intends to adopt a more aggressive stance to support the 
exchange  rate.  We  sold  dollars  yesterday  to  the  interbank  market.  We  are  prepared  to 
intervene  again  if  necessary.  We  are  complementing  this  by  raising  interest  rates  in  the 
interbank market and on repo instruments. 
Of  course  open  market  exchange  rates  are  difficult  to  control  and  no  central  bank  can 
guarantee to move the exchange rate in the direction it wants. However, I want to stress that 
we are not indifferent to further exchange rate depreciation and that for the immediate future, 
curbing  such  depreciation  will  be  a  priority  of  the  Bank  of  Uganda’s  macroeconomic 
management.
