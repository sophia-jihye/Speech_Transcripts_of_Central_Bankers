Erdem Başçi: Recent economic and financial developments in Turkey  
Speech by Mr Erdem Başçi, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at the 
press  conference  for  the  presentation  of  the  April  2011  Inflation  Report,  Ankara,  28  April 
2011. 
 Distinguished Members of the Press, Esteemed Guests, 
Welcome  to  the  press  conference  held  to  convey  the  main  messages  of  the  April  2011 
Inflation Report. 
The Report summarizes the economic outlook underlying monetary policy decisions, shares 
our  evaluations  on  global  and  domestic  macroeconomic  developments  and  presents  the 
medium-term  inflation  forecasts  which  have  been  revised  in  view  of  the  last  quarter 
developments,  along  with  our  monetary  policy  stance.  Moreover,  the  communication  and 
impact  of  our  new  monetary  policy  implementation  are  extensively  analyzed  in  the  Report 
through Boxes.  
Distinguished Members of the Press, 
In  the  first  part  of  my  speech,  I  would  like  to  very  briefly  summarize  the  global  economic 
developments and provide you with a short reminder of the new policy stance that we have 
recently introduced.  
The  global  economy  continued  to  recover  in  the  first  quarter  of  2011,  while  the  growth 
dynamics  between  advanced  and  emerging  economies  continue  to  diverge  (Chart  1). 
Downside risks in advanced economies remain critical, causing these economies to maintain 
expansionary  monetary  policies,  while  domestic  demand  remains  strong  in  emerging 
economies amid accelerated capital inflows.

 Monetary policy developments and monetary conditions 
1. 
The mentioned discrepancy between advanced and emerging economies accelerates capital 
flows into countries, such as Turkey, with strong economic fundamentals and relatively low 
risk. Rapid credit expansion and widening current account deficit fueled by short-term capital 
inflows  increase  risks  to  financial  stability  and  carry  the  potential  to  hamper  price  stability

over  the  medium  term.  This  gives  rise  to  adopting  different  approaches  that  incorporate 
financial stability into the monetary policy framework.  
As  you  have  been  following  very  closely,  we  have  designed  and  adopted  a  new  policy 
strategy as of the end of 2010. While our new policy approach maintains the priority of price 
stability,  we  also  observe  financial  stability  as  a  supporting  objective.  In  this  context,  in 
addition  to  policy  rates,  we  jointly  use  complementary  tools  such  as  reserve  requirement 
ratios and the interest rate corridor. The primary objective of this new approach is to contain 
the negative effects of the ongoing global imbalances on the Turkish economy.  
Now,  I  would  like  to  summarize  the  decisions  that  we  have  made  within  the  new  policy 
strategy. The downtrend in inflation during the last quarter of 2010 allowed the CBRT to give 
relatively  more  weight  to  financial  stability  during  this  period.  In  this  respect,  in  order  to 
reduce  short-term  capital  inflows,  we  lowered  policy  rates  on  one  hand  and  raised  the 
volatility in short-term interest rates by widening the interest rate corridor on the other hand. 
Moreover,  in  order  to  slow  down  credit  expansion,  we  increased  required  reserve  ratios 
(Chart  2).  Meanwhile,  in  order  to  enhance  financial  stability  by  extending  maturity  of  the 
banking  sector  liabilities,  we  differentiated  reserve  requirements  across  maturities,  with 
higher  reserve  requirements  for  short-term  liabilities.  These  measures  led  to  a  fall  in  net 
short-term capital inflows, stopped the acceleration of credit growth and extended maturities 
for deposits.

 In  the  first  quarter  of  2011,  both  the  faster-than-expected  increases  in  oil  prices  and  the 
robust  domestic  demand  required  a  more  cautious  stance  regarding  the  inflation  outlook. 
Specifically,  oil  prices  hovering  significantly  above  our  January 
Inflation  Report’s 
assumptions  led  to  an  increase  in  cost  pressures.  Moreover,  the  ongoing  rapid  growth  in 
private consumption and private investment spending added to the need to contain domestic 
demand  in  order  to  avoid  secondary  effects  of  the  increases  in  oil  and  other  commodity 
prices. 
Notwithstanding  historically  low  inflation  at  4  percent  in  the  first  quarter,  I  would  like  to 
emphasize that we have acted with a medium-term perspective and started to highlight the 
upside  risks  to  inflation  since  February.  Accordingly,  in  order  to  eliminate  the  risk  of 
deterioration  in  general  pricing  behavior,  we  have  adopted  a  stronger  monetary  tightening 
than  was  envisaged  in  the  January  Inflation  Report’s  baseline  scenario.  Accordingly,  the 
policy  rate has  been  kept  constant  since  February,  while  the  weighted  average  of  reserve 
requirement ratios for Turkish lira liabilities was hiked by 410 basis points in March and April 
2

(Table 1). Meanwhile, in April, FX reserve requirement ratios were differentiated by maturity 
where short-term FX reserve requirement ratios were increased slightly. Thus, the policy mix 
composed  of  policy  rates  and  reserve  requirement  ratios  has  been  adjusted  to  deliver  a 
monetary tightening, implying a more cautious monetary stance (Chart 2).

 Although credit growth slowed quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter, the rate of increase in 
loans has yet to fall to levels compatible with financial stability (Chart 3). The upward trend in 
loans  is  driven  by  both  supply  and  demand  side  factors.  While  intense  competition  is 
effective  on  the  supply  side;  the  favorable  economic  outlook  and  the  improvement  in 
employment  conditions  help  to  keep  demand  for  loans  robust.  However,  we  expect  that 
credit utilization will continue to lose pace in the second quarter due to the lagged effects of 
the current monetary tightening.

 Inflation and monetary policy outlook 
2. 
Distinguished Members of the Press, Esteemed Guests,  
Having  summarized  our  monetary  policy  stance  and  the  impact  of  this  stance  on  financial 
markets,  I  would  now  like  to  talk  about  the  macroeconomic  outlook  and  assumptions 
underlying our forecasts. 
First, I would like to summarize the recent inflation developments and then I will compare our 
short-term forecasts with the actual data recorded in the first quarter. As you might recall, in 
the October 2010 Inflation Report, we drew attention to the price hikes due to increases in 
unprocessed  food  and  tobacco  prices,  which  are  beyond  the  control  of  the  CBRT,  and 
concluded  that  these  items  would  leave  sizeable  room  for  disinflation.  In  fact,  during  the 
subsequent  two  quarters,  inflation  declined  by  5.2  percentage  points  and  dropped  to

4 percent in March, a level close to the lower bound of our January Inflation Report forecast 
(Chart 5).

An  analysis  of  inflation  developments  in  terms  of  sub-categories  reveals  that  the  rapid 
decline  in  inflation  was  mainly  driven  by  the  waning  base  effects  from  unprocessed  food, 
energy and tobacco prices and the favorable course of services prices (Chart 6). Meanwhile, 
the rapid increase in import prices and the depreciation of the Turkish lira caused prices of 
core  goods  to  accelerate.  Indeed,  the  rate  of  change  across  all  subcategories  of  the  CPI, 
except core goods, remained below past year averages during the first quarter (Chart 7).

While inflationary pressures by producer prices grew stronger in the first quarter, aggregate 
demand  conditions  provided  less  support  for  disinflation  compared  to  previous  quarters. 
Meanwhile, core goods inflation posted an increase, albeit remaining low (Chart 8). On the

  Esteemed Guests,  
GDP data for the fourth-quarter of 2010 have been in line with the outlook presented in the 
January Inflation Report. The third-quarter slowdown turned out to be temporary as expected 
and economic activity expanded at a remarkable pace in the last quarter. Domestic demand 
became the main determinant of growth in the said period (Chart 10). Thus, the post-crisis 
divergence between domestic and external demand growth became more pronounced in this 
period, confirming the adoption of the new policy mix (Chart 11).

In line with the robust course of economic activity, non-farm employment also maintained its 
upward  trend;  while  unemployment  rates  displayed  a  notable  decline  (Chart  12).  Leading 
indicators signal an ongoing recovery in employment conditions.

 Data for the first quarter of 2011 indicate that economic activity, driven by domestic demand, 
is  more  robust  than  expected.  Accordingly,  our  revised  forecasts  are  based  on  the 
assumption  that  aggregate  demand  conditions  would  provide  less  support  for  disinflation 
compared to the previous period. However, I would like to underline that given the capacity 
utilization  rates  which  are  still  below  pre-crisis  levels  and  unemployment  rates  above 
pre-crisis levels, we assume an outlook where aggregate demand conditions do not impose 
a remarkable upward pressure on inflation by the first quarter of 2011. 
The  absence  of  signs  for  overheating  in  the  economy  is  mainly  owed  to  weak  external 
demand.  In  particular,  the  weak  course  of  economic  activity  the  euro  area  puts  a  cap  to 
growth  of  external  demand.  Therefore,  our  medium-term  forecasts  are  based  on  the 
assumption that external demand will continue to recover gradually and slowly, as was the 
case in the previous Report. In fact, global economy forecasts do not imply any significant 
changes  in  external  markets  in  the  first  quarter.  Accordingly,  Turkey’s  export-weighted 
growth index remained mainly unchanged from the previous reporting period (Chart 13).

 Fiscal  policy  forecasts  are  based  on  the  Medium  Term  Program  (MTP)  projections.  Since 
primary expenditures remained largely in line with MTP targets in the first quarter, the fiscal 
policy  outlook  remained  broadly  unchanged.  Hence,  our  forecasts  are  based  on  the 
assumption primary expenditures and debt to GDP ratios would continue to decline gradually 
and  the  risk  premium  would  remain  broadly  unchanged  over  the  forecast  horizon. 
Furthermore,  tax  adjustments  are  assumed  to  be  consistent  with  inflation  targets  and 
automatic pricing mechanisms.

  Particularly  due  to  supply-side  developments,  oil  and  other  commodity  prices  remained 
considerably  above  our  assumptions  presented  in  the  January  Inflation  Report  (Chart  14). 
Hence, we revised our assumptions for oil and other commodity prices upwards (Table 2). As 
illustrated  on  the  slide,  these  changes  in  assumptions  led  to  an  upward  revision  of  about 
50 basis  points  for  the  end-2011  inflation  forecast  and  a  slightly  upward  revision  for  the  
2012 inflation forecast.

Another  factor  affecting  2011  inflation  forecasts  has  been  the  tariff  hike  on  fabrics  and 
apparels. Although major uncertainties exist about how this development will be reflected on 
prices, we assumed that this would add to year-end inflation by about 50 basis points while 
revising our forecasts. 
Despite  the  recent  benign  course  of  food  prices,  we  preserved  our  assumption  regarding 
food inflation for end-2011 at 7.5 percent in view of the extreme volatility in unprocessed food 
prices and rapid increases in agricultural commodity prices (Table 2). 
In sum, due to developments beyond the control of monetary policy, such as soaring energy 
prices and renewed tariffs, we revised the mid-point for our end-2011 inflation forecast up by 
1 percentage point. 
Distinguished Members of the Press, 
Within  the  new  policy  framework,  the  question  of  how  and  which  policy  tools  will  be 
employed to change the policy stance is determined by factors affecting financial stability and 
price stability. Given the high level of uncertainty arising from global economic conditions, we 
believe that it would be more appropriate to remain flexible regarding the exact content of the 
policy  mix.  Therefore,  in  this  Report,  the  monetary  policy  stance  underlying  our  inflation 
forecasts will continue to be communicated using the term “monetary tightening”, and we will 
not provide any information about the explicit path for individual instruments. 
Against  this  background,  I  now  would  like  to  share  our  inflation  and  output  gap  forecasts. 
Assuming  an  additional  limited  monetary  tightening  during  the  second  half  of  2011,  which 
would bring credit growth to 20–25 percent at the end of 2011, inflation is expected to be, 
with 70 percent probability, between 5.6 and 8.2 percent with a mid-point of 6.9 percent at 
the end of 2011, and between 3.4 and 7.0 percent with a mid-point of 5.2 percent at the end 
of 2012. Inflation is expected to stabilize at around 5 percent in the medium term (Chart 15).

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
Revised  forecasts  suggest  that  credits  should  grow  at  a  measured  and  vigorous  pace  to 
keep inflation in line with targets over the medium term. To this end, we provide a numerical 
range  for  the  annual  rate  of  credit  growth  in  order  to  be  more  concrete.  I  would  like  to 
underline that these growth rates should not be perceived as strict targets for the CBRT. At 
this point, I would also like to emphasize that the nominal credit growth consistent with the 
medium-term  inflation  target  may  vary  over  the  years  depending  on  the  course  of  factors 
such as inflation, growth and the composition of the aggregate demand. 
As  illustrated  on  the  slide,  over  the  next  three  quarters,  inflation  may  display  significant 
fluctuations  mainly  due  to  base  effects  driven  by  food  prices.  Accordingly,  annual  food 
inflation is expected to rise in the second quarter, decline in the third quarter, and increase 
markedly in the last quarter (Chart 15).

  Comparing our current forecasts with those of the previous reporting period, I would like to 
reiterate  that  we  revised  the  initial  point  of  our  output  gap  forecasts  upwards  due  to  the  
more-than-expected increase in the domestic demand in the last quarter of 2010 (Chart 16). 
However, taking into account the stronger-than-expected effects of the monetary tightening 
implemented  in  the  first  quarter,  the  output  gap  is  expected  to  close  at  a  slower  pace 
compared to the previous period. 
In  sum,  due  to  developments  beyond  the  monetary  policy  control  such  as  the  significant 
surge  in  oil  and  other  imports  prices  as  well  as  the  renewed  tariffs,  we  have  revised  our 
inflation expectations upwards (Chart 17). In addition, I would like to remind you that we will 
not respond to first round effects of rising oil and other commodity prices, but second round 
effects will be closely monitored and deterioration in the pricing behavior will not be tolerated. 
It should be emphasized that any new data or information regarding the inflation outlook may 
lead  to  a  change  in  the  monetary  policy  stance.  Therefore,  assumptions  regarding  the 
monetary  policy  outlook  underlying  our  inflation  forecasts  should  not  be  perceived  as  a 
commitment on behalf of the CBRT. 
Risks and monetary policy 
3. 
In the last part of my speech, I would like to mention risks regarding inflation outlook in the 
upcoming period and prospective monetary policy strategies to be implemented should these 
risks materialize. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

We  envision  that  the  impact  of  the  ongoing  monetary  tightening  on  loans  and  domestic 
demand will be more apparent starting from the second quarter. However, the extent and the 
timing of the impact may vary depending on developments beyond the control of monetary 
policy. I would like to underline that as the Central Bank, we will closely monitor the lagged 
effects of our policy measures on price stability and financial stability, and will take additional 
measures if deemed necessary. 
In assessing risk factors and related monetary policy measures under current circumstances, 
we adopt a framework where both price stability and financial stability are taken into account. 
Therefore, risk factors are not only assessed with respect to their impact on the level but also 
on the composition of the aggregate demand. This is because the level of aggregate demand 
is  related  to  price  stability,  while  its  composition  relates  directly  to  financial  stability. 
Therefore, we evaluate risk factors regarding the global economy against this backdrop. 
Although  downside  risks  regarding  the  global  economy  have  decreased  compared  to  the 
previous  reporting  period,  they  still  remain  significant.  Problems  in  credit,  real  estate  and 
labor  markets  in  many  advanced  economies  are  yet  to  be  completely  solved.  Moreover, 
uncertainties regarding debt sustainability and the impact of a possible fiscal consolidation 
persist.  Meanwhile,  rapid  increases  in  oil  prices  may  restrain  global  recovery.  All  these 
factors continue to feed downside risks regarding the pace of global growth. The possibility of 
prolonged  period  of  slow  global  growth  not  only  poses  downside  risks  regarding  external 
demand, but also keeps prospects for strong capital flows to Turkey vigorous. Should such a 
scenario materialize, a policy mix of low policy rate, high reserve requirement ratios and a 
wide  interest  rate  corridor  may  be  implemented  for  a  long  period.  Moreover,  an  outcome 
whereby  problems  in  advanced  economies  intensify,  leading  to  contraction  in  domestic 
economic activity, may require an easing in all policy instruments. In other words, we may 
consider joint cuts in policy rates and reserve requirement ratios. 
Although downside risks to global economy remain notable, upside risks are also becoming 
more significant. Major uncertainties exist regarding the lagged impacts of the exceptionally 
loose  monetary  policies  implemented  by  advanced  economies  on  global  economic  activity 
and inflation. If the global economy faces a faster-than-expected recovery in the upcoming 
period, inflationary pressures may arise sooner than envisaged in the advanced economies. 
Materialization of such a scenario would mean a tightening by using policy rates as well as 
reserve  requirements  against  higher  global  policy  rates  and  demand-pull  inflationary 
pressure. 
As  I  have  previously  emphasized,  the  outlook  for  oil  and  other  commodity  prices  remains 
uncertain. Should the increases in commodity prices persist and impose risks on achieving 
medium-term inflation targets, additional tightening may be implemented sooner than implied 
by the baseline scenario. However, given that higher oil prices will also worsen the current 
account  balance,  a  possible  policy  response  will  consider  macro  financial  risks  as  well. 
Therefore, the exact content of the adopted policy mix may vary depending on the outlook for 
external demand, capital flows and the credit growth. 
Esteemed Guests, 
We will continue to monitor fiscal policy developments closely while formulating our monetary 
policy strategy. Our inflation forecasts assume that the ratio of fiscal expenditures to GDP will 
evolve as projected in the MTP. A revision in the monetary policy stance may be considered 
should the fiscal stance deviate significantly from this framework, and consequently has an 
adverse  effect  on  the  medium-term  inflation  outlook.  Increasing  government  saving,  thus 
sustaining  fiscal  discipline,  under  current  circumstances  is  essential  to  control  the  current 
account deficit driven by the divergence between domestic and external demand. Therefore 
saving the extra tax revenues driven by the stronger-than-expected economic activity would 
not only reduce financial stability risks, but also enhance the effectiveness of the new policy 
mix.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
Monetary  policy  in  the  period  ahead  will  continue  to  focus  on  building  price  stability  on  a 
permanent basis. To this end, the impact of the macroprudential measures taken by CBRT 
and  other  institutions  on  the  inflation  outlook  will  also  be  assessed  carefully.  Fulfilling  the 
commitment  to  maintain  fiscal  discipline  and  strengthening  the  structural  reform  agenda  in 
the medium term would contribute to the improvement of Turkey’s sovereign risk, and thus, 
enhance macroeconomic stability and the price stability. Maintaining fiscal discipline will also 
provide more room for monetary policy maneuver and support the social welfare by keeping 
interest rates permanently at low levels. I would like conclude my remarks by reiterating that 
implementation  of  the  structural  reforms  envisaged  by  the  MTP  and  the  European  Union 
accession process remains to be of the utmost importance. 
Thank you for your attention.
