DISTINGUSIHED INVITED GUESTS;  
MEMBERS OF THE PRESS;  
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.  
Let  me  begin  by  thanking  BancABC  for  inviting  me  to  be  the  guest  of  honour  at  this  very 
important  event,  where  we  will  witness  the  signing  of  a  credit  line  worth  US  $5  million 
between  BancABC  and 
for  Developing  Countries 
(NORFUND).  It  is  pleasing  to  know  that  the  credit  line  to  be  signed  this  morning  is 
specifically  tailored  to  provide  financial  support  to  Small  and  Medium  scale  enterprises 
(SMEs).  The  development  of  the  SME  sector  and  its  potential  to  contribute  to  aggregate 
productivity  growth,  economic  growth  and  development  have  been  stifled  by  the  generally 
limited access to finance.  
The credit line to be signed today is an important milestone in improving access to finance by 
the SMEs in the country. Equally as important as access to finance is the price of financing 
that is placed at the disposal of SMEs. The general trend in the market has been to charge 
SMEs  with  high  interest  rates  relative  to  the  large  scale  corporate  sector  because  of  the 
perceived high risk they are supposed to present.  
Distinguished  Invited  Guests,  my  view  is  that  this  presumed  high  risk  profile  associated 
with  SMEs  can  be  effectively  managed  by  banks  if  they  make  the  necessary  effort  to 
understand the sector and build expertise in dealing with its unique characteristics. I trust that 
you will double up your effort in building the expertise necessary for your bank to be a major 
lender to the SME sector.  
The issue of interest rates is of particular concern to us at the central bank. In response to 
the  current  situation,  the  Bank  of  Zambia  recently  took  measures  aimed  at  facilitating  the 
reduction in commercial banks’ lending rates with the view to increasing access to credit by 
private individuals and business entities. Some progress has been made in this area and we 
are monitoring the situation in the market to ensure that borrowers are enjoying a reduction 
in their effective lending rates. We do not want the reduction in the base lending rates to be 
cosmetic, but should be reflected in lower effective lending rates for measures taken so far to 
be meaningful. Furthermore, with the reduction in the corporate tax rate for banks recently 
announced  by  the  Minister  of  Finance  in  his  2012  Budget,  the  expectation  is  for  a  further 
reduction in lending rates by commercial banks going forward.  
Ladies and Gentlemen, This initiative is positive and both BancABC and NORFUND should 
be highly commended for it. As a financing institution, I am aware that NORFUND financing 
rates are favourable. I want to encourage BancABC to pass the benefit of getting money at

favourable NORFUND rates to the final borrowers so that the SME sector will experience the 
full benefit of this relationship. I wish to end by wishing BancABC the best and success in 
growing a successful SME lending portfolio.  
I THANK YOU…
