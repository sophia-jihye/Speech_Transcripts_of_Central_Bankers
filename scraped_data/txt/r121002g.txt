Rodrigo Vergara: Chile’s latest Monetary Policy Report 
Presentation by Mr Rodrigo Vergara, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, of the Monetary 
Policy Report before the Honorable Senate of the Republic, Santiago de Chile, 5 September 
2012. 
The Monetary Policy Report of September 2012 can be found at http://www.bcentral.cl. 
 Introduction 
Mr. President of the Senate, Senator Camilo Escalona, honorable senators. 
I am grateful for your invitation to the Board of the Central Bank of Chile to present our latest 
Monetary Policy Report. As usual every year in September, this presentation coincides with 
the annual report of the Central Bank Board to the Senate, which contains our view on recent 
macroeconomic and financial developments in Chile and in the world, as well as their outlook 
and implications for the conduct of monetary policy. 
In the last few months, the differences between the performance of the global economy and 
the Chilean economy have deepened. The situation abroad is still very complex. Forecasts 
for world growth have weakened, mainly because of sharper than expected deceleration in 
emerging market economies (EMEs). Tensions in international markets have eased in recent 
weeks,  but  fundamental  problems  are  still  present.  The  Chilean  economy,  however,  in 
contrast  with  most  of  the  rest  of  the  world,  is  performing  strongly.  In  the  second  quarter, 
domestic output and demand grew above projections, showing that, so far, the effects of the 
frail external scenario on the local economy have been mild. 
The  growth  forecast  for  2012  we  are  presenting  in  this  Report,  details  of  which  I  will  be 
sharing with you in a few moments, runs higher than what we presented before the Finance 
Commission of this Senate last June. A number of factors have contributed to this growth, 
including increased personal income resulting from labor market strength, an expansion of 
credit  to  firms  and  households,  as  well  as  the  impulse  from  investment  in  mining  and 
complementary  projects  associated  to  the  high  copper  price.  Consumer  and  business 
confidence  has  risen  or  remained  in  optimistic  levels.  Another  contributor  was  the  drop  in 
inflation in recent months, reflecting the prices of perishable foodstuffs and fuels. The latter, 
however, has tended to revert in the past few weeks. 
However, the macroeconomic scenario entails significant risks and, to some extent, opposing 
ones, that drive monetary policy to face a difficult dilemma. On one hand, the effects of the 
frail international conditions on world growth and external financial conditions should help to 
reduce the strength of the Chilean economy. In addition, there is the possibility of a further 
deterioration of the external scenario, with more acute consequences on our economy. On 
the  other  hand,  the  recent  intensification  in  installed  capacity  utilization,  as  well  as  the 
widening of the current account deficit, reflect the persistence of a degree of dynamism of 
domestic demand that also entails medium term risks for inflation and the vulnerability of the 
country’s external accounts. 
For good reasons, the Chilean economy is open commercially and financially to the world, 
and, because of the nature of its exports, is strongly affected by shocks coming from abroad. 
In  the  past  we  have  benefited  from  the  external  situation.  We  have  also  felt  the 
consequences  when  the  external  situation  has  deteriorated.  We  cannot  isolate  ourselves 
from these external impulses, and it would not be a good idea to do so. The important thing, 
however, is that we have developed a policy framework that allows us to absorb and mitigate 
these  shocks  in  the  best  way  possible.  Chile  needs  to keep  a  robust  macroeconomic  and 
financial policy scheme that helps it overcome effectively these external disturbances at the 
lowest possible cost for the country.

Part  of  this  scheme  is  the  autonomous  central  bank  with  clear-cut  objectives:  low,  stable 
inflation, and the normal operation of internal and external payments. Our monetary policy is 
oriented at attaining an explicit inflation target over a medium-term horizon, by applying an 
independent monetary policy that contributes to stabilize the business cycle. Its complement 
is a floating exchange rate regime. Another important element is responsible and predictable 
fiscal  policy  making,  as  reflected  in  its  governing  rule.  Add  a  sound  financial  system,  with 
proper  regulation  and  supervision.  Plus  ever  growing  commercial  and financial  integration. 
The fact that the deterioration of the developed economies has not hit our exports so hard is 
the result of this diversification of external markets, among other factors. 
Let me delve into some aspects of these pillars. In terms of regulation and supervision of the 
financial system, the causes and effects of the crisis of 2008-2009 have taught great lessons 
to policy makers around the world. Suffice is to mention the changes that are being effected 
in the United States and the Eurozone, such as the Dodd-Frank Act and the instauration of a 
European banking authority. In Chile, our financial system was not involved in the practices 
that  originated  the  crisis  in  the  developed  world,  because  our  legislation  does  not  allow  it. 
Even so, we are permanently reviewing our legislation in light of the experiences and best 
practices in place today in the world. 
Another significant aspect has to do with our foreign exchange policy. In recent weeks the 
peso has appreciated against the dollar, prompting some sectors to demand intervention by 
the Central Bank. I think that some clarification is in order. In the first place, I reaffirm the 
validity of a flexible exchange rate for the Chilean economy. Our economic history is full of 
examples in this area.  So far, the scheme that has yielded the best results for economies 
similar  to  the  Chilean  is  a  floating  exchange  rate  regime.  When  policy  makers  sought  to 
artificially control the value of our currency, imbalances were generated that ended up being 
very costly for the country. The adoption of exchange rate flexibility in 1999 has allowed us to 
wade subsequent complex moments. The worst was the world recession of 2009, when the 
floating  exchange  rate  policy  allowed  accommodating  the  sharp  changes  in  the  external 
scenario,  both  via  the  depreciation  of  the  peso  and  an  active  monetary  policy  to  stabilize 
demand. In turn, the creation of instruments designed to shield the economy from short-run 
fluctuations in this variable, permits to bound its effects on hedged agents. Certainly more 
can be achieved in this sense, but there have been important advances. 
Still, the Central Bank has always reserved the right to intervene the forex market. We have 
done  it  four  times  since  1999.  However,  this  type  of  measures,  which  are  used  only 
exceptionally, must be based on solid grounds. In the past, these interventions have been 
justified by the Central Bank’s international liquidity position and by obvious and persistent 
deviations of the real exchange rate from its medium- to long-term fundamentals. 
In the present circumstances, it is not evident that these criteria apply. In the first place, it is 
important  to  note  that  the  current  level  of  the  real  exchange  rate,  while  low  compared  to 
some months ago and also with respect to the average of the last fifteen to twenty years, is 
within the range believed to reflect its underlying fundamentals. It is certainly in the lower part 
of the range, but still consistent with its long-term fundamentals (figure i). 
As I said, the elements behind the peso appreciation are manifold. On one hand there is the 
favorable level of our terms of trade. Despite the downturn of the developed world and the 
deceleration in China, commodity prices have remained high, especially for copper. This has 
driven today’s terms of trade, despite a drop this year, to be fairly high by historic standards. 
In fact, other commodity exporting economies, such as Australia, New Zealand or Canada, 
have seen appreciations in their currencies that are comparable with that of the Chilean peso 
(figure ii). 
On the other hand, there is our strong economy, partly related to the effects of the higher 
copper  price  on  the  public  sector’s  structural  income  and  expenditure,  as  well  as  with  the 
greater impulse coming from mining projects and related investments. While the developed 
world is weak and the main emerging economies are decelerating beyond projections, Chile 
2 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
is growing more than expected. The differentials between developed countries’ and Chilean 
interest rates reflect this dissimilar stage in the cycle.  
It must be noted that the appreciation of the local currency with respect to the dollar is not an 
exclusive feature of the Chilean economy. This phenomenon is shared by all the exporters 
that  are  our  competitors  in  the  world  markets.  This,  because  it  originates  primarily  in  the 
weak  dollar,  which  in  turn  originates  in  the  strong  monetary  expansion  carried  out  by  the 
United  States.  However,  as  I  said  before,  this  is  the  result  not  only  of  the  expansionary 
monetary policy, but also of weak domestic demand and external imbalances in the U.S. The 
case of Europe is comparable, and that is why the euro has also depreciated against other 
currencies, not only the peso. In order for growth of developed countries to improve and the 
overall  world  economy  to  pick  up,  the  domestic  demand  of  countries  in  a  strong  cyclical 
position needs to be redirected to imports, while at the same time those countries with weak 
domestic demand increase their exports.  
The second factor advocated to intervene the forex market is the need to hoard international 
reserves. This, for protection against a further worsening of the external scenario. Over the 
past  several  years,  the  Central  Bank  has  increased  its  level  of  reserves  significantly.  The 
interventions of 2008 and 2011 increased the reserves by nearly 18 billion dollars, to twice 
the level of December 2007. Thus, at July this year, our reserves amounted to close to 15% 
of GDP. 
Certainly,  there  are  benefits  associated  with  hoarding  international  reserves.  An  economy 
with a higher level of international reserves reduces the probability of sudden changes in its 
external credit conditions, moderates its effects and provides room for policy makers to take 
offsetting  measures.  By  the  same  token,  it  is  important  that  the  level  and  management  of 
international  reserves  are  such  that  they  can  be  readily  available  whenever  it  is  deemed 
necessary.  Still,  the  gains  obtained  in  the  margin  are  lower  the  greater  the  amount 
accumulated. The reserves accumulation carried out by the Bank in the past few years, as 
well  as  management  thereof  –  details  are  provided  in  an  Appendix  –  should  suffice  to 
confront extreme episodes. Chile also has sovereign wealth funds that could help alleviate 
the  financing  needs  in  case  of  increased  external  tensions  as  well.  The  foreign  funds  of 
institutional investors can also act as stabilizing agents in this sense. 
On the other hand, we must always bear in mind that any intervention has associated costs. 
First, it can blur the objective of the Central Bank: inflation or exchange rate target. In our 
case,  we  have  dealt  with  this  problem  by  carrying  out  transparent,  sterilized  interventions, 
with a publicly known timetable that does not conflict with the formulation of monetary policy. 
In addition, our communication has been straightforward in stating that the objective of our 
monetary policy is price stability. 
Second,  an  intervention  entails  a  significant  financial  cost  for  the  Central  Bank  and  the 
country.  International  reserves  are  invested  in  highly  liquid  assets  abroad,  whose  yield  is 
lower  than  the  interest  paid  on  the  debt  securities  in  pesos  that  are  used  to  sterilize  the 
purchase.  In  the  current  scenario,  in  which  external-domestic  interest  rate  differentials  are 
significant and expected to remain so for some time, the financial cost of holding reserves is 
substantial  and  negatively  affects  the  Bank’s  balance  sheet  continually.  In  an  Appendix  to 
this Report, we forecast that the negative net worth of the Bank will go from 2% to 3.8% of 
GDP  between  2011  and  2013.  Such  deterioration  is  explained  by  the  composition  of  our 
assets  and  liabilities.  In  the  current  circumstances,  expanding  our  reserves  would  further 
worsen  our  financial  position.  Although  the  Bank’s  negative  net  worth  has  not  been  an 
impediment for monetary policy conduct, taking actions that increase such negative value is 
a cost to be paid by all Chilean citizens. 
Having  said  all  this  about  the  convenience  or  not  of  a  forex  intervention,  undoubtedly  the 
best way for our exporting sector to boost competitiveness in the world markets is through 
constant  improvement  of  processes,  both  by  investing  in  technology  and  developing  their 
human capital. Likewise, it is important to be constantly on the lookout for new markets of

destination and product innovation, to ensure better conditions for their businesses. In any 
case,  there  are  also  internal  issues  that  must  be  resolved  to  back  our  producers’ 
competitiveness,  including  any  measures  that  disentangle  administrative  processes  when 
creating and maintaining a firm and especially, establishing a policy that aims at developing a 
balanced energy matrix that can reduce energy costs. As we have said before, the cost of 
electric power in Chile, which is an important input of productive activity, is higher than the 
OECD member countries’ average. 
Let me now describe the macroeconomic scenario contained in our Monetary Policy Report. 
Macroeconomic scenario 
As I said earlier, in the past several months the differences between the performance of the 
global and the domestic economy have deepened. The external scenario remains complex, 
and  the  growth  outlook  has  weakened  somewhat  with  respect  to  June’s  forecasts.  In 
contrast, Chile grew more than foreseen in the second quarter, intensifying the utilization of 
installed  capacity.  Headline  inflation  has  been  lower  than  expected  and  is  currently  at  the 
lower part of the tolerance range, as are core measures. Within core inflation, the difference 
between  the  behavior  of  goods  inflation  and  services  inflation  stands  out. The  latter, more 
closely  related  to  the  state  of  the  output  gaps,  is  still  near  5%  annually,  reflecting  that 
medium-term inflation risks are still present. In this context, the Board has held the monetary 
policy interest rate (MPR) constant at 5%. 
Internationally, the biggest news has concentrated in the performance of the emerging world, 
shaping  a  scenario  where  deceleration  exceeds  forecasts. The  reduced  strength  of  Brazil, 
China and India stands out. Several elements are behind this slowdown, including the effects 
on their exports of the global deceleration, especially from Europe, and the stringent policies 
applied  in  the  past.  This  has  driven  the  notorious  drop  in  these  countries’  manufacturing 
growth rates. 
In Latin America the outlook is still quite heterogeneous. As I just said, the sharp deceleration 
of Brazil is worth noting. Given its size, it explains a large part of the downward revision of 
growth  figures  for  the  region  this  year  and  next.  However,  going  forward  a  recovery  is 
foreseen,  considering  that  the  expansionary  measures  adopted  by  its  policy  makers  have 
begun  to  bear  fruit.  Colombia  and  Argentina  have  also  shown  signs  of  deceleration,  But 
Colombia growing more than Argentina. Peru, meanwhile, is still growing strongly. In Mexico, 
growth  during  the  first  half  of  the  year  exceeded  expectations,  but  in  the  near  future  the 
effects of the frail external sector will be seen more clearly. 
The  developed  economies  continue  to  show  weak  growth.  The  developed  economies 
continue to post weak growth. In the United States, the overall evaluation is still of a slow 
recovery.  The  United  Kingdom  is  in  recession,  affected  by  anemic  external  and  internal 
demand,  the  latter  influenced  by  tight  credit  conditions  and  policies  aimed  at  fiscal 
consolidation. In the Eurozone, the GDP shrank in the second quarter, after being flat in the 
early  part  of  the  year.  The  performance  of  the  zone  continued  to  be  marked  by  big 
differences  between  peripheral  economies  (with  sharp  falls)  and  central  European 
economies  (with  modest  increases),  reflecting  financial  and  fiscal  vulnerabilities.  However, 
the weakness of some incoming indicators from Germany is cause for concern, particularly 
domestic  consumption  compounded  by 
its  exports  and 
manufactures. 
Some calm has come to the external financial markets, originating, among other causes, in 
the announcements that steps will be taken towards a banking union and the statements by 
the governor of the European Central Bank regarding the possibility of shortly implementing 
a  sovereign  bond  purchase  plan,  upon  previous  political  agreement  on  a  fiscal  austerity 
program. Besides, no significant sovereign debt payments from peripheral economies have 
fallen due in the past several  weeks. However, the region faces a tough path, because of 
considerable difficulties to carry out these actions. For example, how a banking union for the 
the  weak  performance  of 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
Eurozone  could  be  materialized  is  unclear  and,  for  the  time  being,  there  is  no  unanimous 
support  from  member  countries.  In  addition,  there  is  the  negative  outlook  placed  for 
Germany’s  and  other  central  Eurozone  economies’  ratings.  Plus,  in  the  coming  months, 
several events will occur that may revive market tensions. For September there is, among 
other developments, the evaluation of the tripartite group on the degree of compliance with 
agreed adjustments in Greece and the possibility of a new program, aside from the voting at 
the German constitutional tribunal on the legality of the ESM. For October, there is a strict 
calendar  of  debt  maturities  in  Spain,  which  entails  refinancing  obligations  in  international 
markets. 
The  impulse  from  abroad  on  the  Chilean  economy  will  be  somewhat  milder  than  was 
foreseen a few months back. On one hand, in the baseline scenario our trading partners will 
grow 3.5% in 2012 and 3.8% in 2013, one tenth of a point less than forecast in June. This, as 
aforesaid, because of the downward revisions to emerging economies’ growth. On the other 
hand, the terms of trade will be less favorable than projected then. The price of oil and fuels 
will  be  higher  than  assumed  in  June,  because  of  supply-side  problems  and  increasing 
geopolitical risks in the Middle East. On top of this is – also because of supply-side problems 
–  the  increase  in food  prices  in  the  world  markets,  especially  for grains.  The  copper  price 
projection  does  not  change  from  June.  Finally,  despite  the  observed  calm,  the  baseline 
scenario considers new episodes of stress in global financial markets, similar of those of the 
past year. This, because of the events foreseen for the coming months and the difficulties of 
advancing towards a more long-lasting solution to the problems in the Eurozone (table 1). 
In  Chile,  the  greatest  news  is  stronger-than-expected  growth  in  output  and  demand  in  the 
second quarter of the year. Output owes its dynamism to sectors linked to domestic demand, 
such as construction, trade and services. The better result of the manufacturing industry is 
also  worth  noting,  which,  although  growing  less  than  aggregate  GDP,  still  exceeded 
expectations,  also  driven  by  the  lines  associated  with  demand,  especially  investment  and 
specific  export-oriented  activities.  On  the  expenditures  side,  inventory  accumulation 
intensified with respect to previous months. (figure iii). This seems to respond to an attempt 
to rebuild inventory levels after the reduction of late 2011 and that, at the time, was linked to 
the expected negative effects of the external scenario on final sales. Also worth noting was 
the  renewed  strength  of  consumption  and  gross  fixed  capital  formation.  Consumption 
continues to rely on the evolution of the labor market and fairly stable financial conditions. 
Regarding investment, the contribution of construction and infrastructure works stands out, 
relating mainly to mining and energy projects, but also to a strengthened real-estate sector, 
which reflects on the performance of commercial loans. 
The  behavior  of  output,  especially  of  sectors  other  than  natural  resources,  and  domestic 
demand intensified the utilization of installed capacity. Although y-o-y growth in employment 
and  nominal  wages  has  dropped,  the  labor  market  remains  tight  (figure  iv).  However,  the 
increased  domestic  demand  pressure,  especially  from  investment,  together  with  lower 
copper prices compared with 2011, have led to a widening of the current account deficit. In 
the moving year ending the second quarter of 2012 this deficit rose to 2.7% of GDP, from 
1.3% at the close of 2011. 
In the past few months, y-o-y inflation has continued on a downward path, influenced by fuel 
prices.  Core  inflation,  which  excludes  foodstuffs  and  energy  (CPIEFE)  has  stabilized  near 
2.5%.  The  difference  between  core  inflation  for  goods  and  core  inflation  for  services  has 
prevailed. The latter, more closely related to the state of output gaps, has hovered around 
5%,  a  reflection  of  existing  medium-term  risks  on  inflation.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
downsloping path of headline inflation is largely explained by the goods component (figure v).  
The baseline scenario assumes that this year the Chilean economy will grow between 4.75% 
and 5.25%. The correction is explained mainly by actual data for the first half of the year and 
because the effects of the external situation on the Chilean economy will be milder than was 
forecast  in  June.  However,  the  baseline  scenario  assumes  that,  during  the  second  half  of 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 5 
2012 the GDP will post lower growth rates than in the first half, gradually leading to a normal 
usage  of  installed  capacity.  The  Board continues  to  estimate trend GDP  growth  at  around 
5%.  For  2013,  the  Board  foresees  GDP  growing  between  4%  and  5%.  In  the  baseline 
scenario,  the  current  account  deficit  for  this  year  is  estimated  at  3.2%  of  GDP.  In  2013  it 
should widen to 4.4% as a reflection of strong domestic demand and, to a lesser extent, of a 
lower copper price. The fact that the widening of the current account deficit responds mainly 
to stronger expected domestic demand is confirmed in expectations that the current account 
measured at trend prices will also post a larger deficit in 2013 than in 2012, going from 4.6% 
of GDP to 5.2%. I will return to this subject in a while (table 2). 
As  for  inflation,  the  baseline  scenario  foresees  that  CPI  inflation  will  end  the  year  below 
June’s projections, reaching 2.5%. It will then return gradually to 3% by the second half of 
2013, to stay in the neighborhood until the end of the projection horizon, this time the third 
quarter of 2014. The CPIEFE will converge to 3% later than foreseen in June (figure vi). This 
trajectory  assumes  that  wages  will  be  adjusted  according  to  productivity  and  the  inflation 
target.  A  methodological  assumption  is  that  the  RER  will  remain  around  its  recent  figures 
during the forecast horizon. Finally, the baseline scenario uses as a working assumption that 
the MPR will remain stable over the short term. 
The baseline scenario reflects the developments that the Board believes to be the most likely 
to occur with the information at hand at the statistical closing of the Report. However, there 
are  risk  scenarios  that,  if  materialized,  might  change  –  significantly,  in  some  cases  –  the 
macroeconomic outlook and, therefore, the course of monetary policy. On this occasion, after 
evaluating the alternative scenarios, the Board estimates that the risk balance for output and 
inflation is unbiased. 
Abroad, the risks described during the past several quarters have not changed significantly. 
The situation of the Eurozone is complex. The materialization of the announcements will not 
be  easy  and  the  passing  of  time  will  bring  more  problems  to  the  economies  of  peripheral 
Europe, so a severe aggravation of the financial crisis in the Eurozone or even more extreme 
scenarios with systemic implications cannot be ruled out. Add to this the discussion in the 
United States to prevent fiscal adjustments from being triggered in 2013. If attempts to reach 
agreements  are  unsuccessful,  this  economy’s  GDP  growth  could  fall  significantly  and 
tensions could increase in financial markets. 
In the emerging world, the biggest risk is a deepening of signs of economic slowdown. On 
aggregate,  the  world  growth  forecast  does  not  divert  from  the  average  of  the  past  15  to 
20 years, but this has been sustained by the expansion of the larger emerging economies. 
Particularly  preoccupying  is  the  performance  of  China,  due  to  its  weight  in  the  world 
economy and its relevance in the evolution of the prices of copper. Should it post a sharper 
deceleration,  global  growth  would  weaken  further,  with  intensified  effects  on  commodity 
exporting economies like Chile, which are still growing at high rates. Another possibility is for 
supply-side  factors  to  intensify  recent  increases  in  the  prices  of  some  commodities, 
especially fuels and grains.  
Locally,  medium-term  inflationary  risks  are  still  present.  The  recent  trajectory  of  the  world 
prices of fuels and some foodstuffs could rapidly pass through to inflation, all the more so 
considering  the  current  state  of  output  gaps.  In  addition,  if  domestic  output  and  demand 
remain as dynamic even or more so, they can further intensify the usage of installed capacity 
pressuring inflation away from the target. At the same time, this could also could result in a 
widening of the current account deficit that could create vulnerability factors in the economy 
in  a  complex  global  environment.  Actually,  if  this  phenomenon  occurs  within  a  context  of 
sudden drops in the copper price or costlier external financing, difficult adjustments could be 
necessary. 
The  current  macroeconomic  scenario  poses  significant  risks,  demanding  policy 
responses in different directions. On one hand, although so far its effects have been mild, 
the external situation is severe. Chile is a small economy, commercially and financially open, 
6 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
so it will not be immune to global developments. The probability of extreme events has not 
diminished, and their materialization could have very severe consequences on output around 
the world, including Chile. On the other hand, the strength of domestic demand and output, 
together  with  recent  increases  in  some  commodity  prices,  means  that  medium-term 
inflationary risks remain present. The MPR is within a range of values that are considered 
neutral, providing flexibility to wait for the concrete effects of such scenarios on the Chilean 
economy  to  become  visible.  The  Board  monitors  closely  the  evolution  of  the  external  and 
internal  macroeconomic  scenario  and  its  implications  on  inflation,  and  reiterates  its 
commitment  to  conduct  monetary  policy  so  that  projected  inflation  stands  at  3%  over  the 
policy horizon. 
Allow me some final remarks. 
Final remarks 
Our  latest  presentations  to  the  Senate  have  been  marked  by  periods  of  high  volatility  or 
relative calm in international financial markets. But at yearend 2011 and last June we brought 
our  Monetary  Policy  Report  to  you  in  the  midst  of  heavy  external  turbulence,  with  market 
expectations that did not rule out the occurrence of worst-case scenarios in the near future. 
Today, as in last March, we are presenting our Report in a calmer environment, but where 
the risks are still there. 
Our baseline scenario assumes that stress episodes will be repeated in the world markets. 
Why  is  that?  Simply  because  the  situation  in  developed  economies  with  their  complex 
macroeconomic, financial and fiscal problems is far from being resolved. There is a long road 
ahead. The classical economic policy conundrum is time consistency, as the costs are paid 
upfront  for  promised  benefits  for  the  future.  Plus,  in  the  case  of  the  Eurozone,  a  difficult 
collective  action  problem,  due  to  difficulties  in  spreading  the  cost  among  those  involved. 
Thus,  policy  decisions  are  pushed  back  while  the  problems  needing  resolution  only 
aggravate over time. 
We  may  add  that  the  bigger  emerging  economies,  including  China,  Brazil  and  India,  are 
showing  signs  of  a  sharper  than  expected  deceleration.  Their  weight  in  world  trade,  and 
particularly with Chile, makes us worry about their evolution. Although the copper price has 
been  fairly  stable,  a  further  deceleration  of  the  Chinese  economy  could  have  significant 
effects on the rest of the world and drive us to a complex situation, especially if it triggers a 
reduction in our terms of trade. 
Let us stop for a moment to examine the current account of the balance of payments. In our 
Report’s baseline scenario we forecast that in 2012 and 2013 the current account will post a 
deficit of around 3 to 4% of GDP. These balances contrast with what has been the behavior 
of the current account in recent years. It is striking because it happens at a time that, despite 
the complex external scenario, the terms of trade facing our country are favorable. 
The  persistence  and  expansion  of  high  current  account  deficits  may  generate  factors  of 
vulnerability for the Chilean economy when facing an external shock. Although an economy’s 
current account deficit is not a sufficient condition to anticipate a crisis of some sort, it does 
help  increase  its  probability  of  occurrence.  For  example,  due  to  the  importance  that  this 
variable may have in sovereign risk, external credit conditions and, ultimately, on access to 
the sources that sustain such deficit.  
In  the  past,  a  significant  part  of  the  crises  that  the  country  endured  have  had  to  do  with 
persistently,  high  current  account  deficits.  Accordingly,  the  Board  cannot  overestimate  the 
importance of closely monitoring the factors underlying our current deficit, in order to prevent 
the incubation of imbalances affecting the future performance of our economy. 
However,  a  big  difference  with  the  past  is  that  today  our  economy  has  made  progress  in 
devising mechanisms to deal with external shocks and imbalances. Thus, as I said before, 
we  need  to  maintain  and  permanently  improve  the  macroeconomic  pillars  that  have  made

our economy stable and resilient. On our part, with constant observation of the factors that 
may jeopardize our financial stability and the normal functioning of our payment system, in 
order  to  adapt  our  regulations  for  better  regulation  and  supervision.  Also,  with  our 
commitment to maintain our flexible exchange rate policy, which we believe is the best way 
to  deal  opportunely  with  any  sudden  changes  in  external  conditions  and  rely  on  monetary 
policy to alleviate its effects on the Chilean economy. 
Finally, through a credible monetary policy aimed at controlling inflation. Inflation is a source 
of social stress, that hits with special force the most needy: those unable to negotiate wage 
adjustments to sharp changes in the price level. 
As we have insisted time and again in recent months, monetary policy has to juggle with two 
opposing forces. Pulling in one direction, there is a weak external scenario that will not add 
momentum to our economy. In the other, there is strong domestic output and demand, with 
tight output gaps and labor market. It is the task of the Central Bank to conduct monetary 
policy avoiding the incubation of pressures pushing inflation away from the target. 
Facing  this  environment  of  high  risks  and  volatility,  the  Board  has kept a  prudent  attitude. 
Acting hastily would only reduce its capacity for action. As unreasonable as supposing that 
we will be spared the problems of the world, is thinking that we are being severely affected 
by  them.  Time  will  shed  more  light  on  the  true  effects  of  developments  abroad  on  Chile’s 
external position and the evolution of domestic balances. For now, it is important that we take 
the  opportunities  we  have  to  preserve  and  enhance  the  soundness  of  our  economy,  but 
bearing in mind that there are risks and that they are significant. 
Thank you.
