Martin Flodén: My view of monetary policy and household debt 
Speech  by  Mr  Martin  Flodén,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  Swedbank, 
Stockholm, 24 September 2013. 
 This is my first speech since taking up the post of Deputy Governor of the Riksbank. Since I 
started in the spring I have taken part in two monetary policy meetings. On both occasions I 
have entered a reservation against the majority decision and advocated a lower repo rate. It 
therefore  seems  natural  for  me  to  devote  my  speech  today  to  explaining  my  view  of 
monetary policy and the reasons for my reservations. 
Should monetary policy take into account households’ high and rising indebtedness? This is 
a  question  that  has  been  central  for  monetary  policy  in  recent  years  and  also  at  my  first 
monetary  policy  decisions.  I  consider  it  clear  that  the  Riksbank  has  a  responsibility  to 
safeguard financial stability and prevent crises linked to credit granting. However, it is not so 
clear what consequences this responsibility has with regard to conducting monetary policy in 
practice. I shall explain my reasoning at the recent monetary policy meetings. I also intend to 
comment  on  how  the  new  framework  for  macroprudential  policy  may  affect  my  view  of 
monetary  policy.  However,  I  shall  begin  with  a  brief  description  of  my  view,  and  the 
Riksbank’s view, of the economic situation. 
Positive signs but risks remain 
In recent months we have been able to see some positive signs in the Swedish economy, 
and  also  abroad.  Confidence  has  risen  in  both  the  household  and  corporate  sectors  in 
Sweden,  and  there  are  some  signs  that  unemployment  is  falling.  In  the  euro  area,  GDP 
increased  in  the  second  quarter,  after  six  quarters  in  a  row  of  falling  GDP.  Here,  too,  the 
confidence indicators are giving more positive signals. 
However,  one  must  remember  that  the  economies  still  have  a  long  way  to  go  to  reach  a 
normal status. GDP growth and inflation are at low levels in both Sweden and the euro area. 
And  there  are  still  large  downside  risks  for  economic  developments.  In  the  euro  area,  the 
weak  public  sector  finances  and  problems  in  the  banks’  balance  sheets  have  scarcely 
improved in recent months. In the United States, the full effects of the sequester have not yet 
been realised, and there is also uncertainty over how the debt ceiling will be raised during the 
autumn. 
Growth  rates  in  large  emerging  markets  like  China  and  India  have  fallen,  albeit  from  very 
high levels. Previously, international capital has tended to move towards emerging markets 
as interest rates have been low in the more developed economies. However, as yields on US 
government  bonds  have  been  rising  since  the  spring,  the  capital  flows  have  changed 
direction.  The  outflow  of  capital  means  that  exchange  rates  are  weakening,  which  may 
improve the countries’ international competitiveness and contribute to maintaining their high 
level  of  economic  activity.  But  the  large  fluctuations  in  growth  rates,  capital  flows  and 
exchange  rates  are  in  themselves  problematic  and  create  uncertainty  regarding  economic 
developments in the emerging markets. 
A divided Swedish economy 
The  Swedish  economy  is  dependent  on  developments  abroad,  and  of  course  has  been 
affected  by  the  financial  crisis  and  economic  downturn  in  recent  years.  In  an  international 
comparison, overall quantities such as GDP and employment have nevertheless developed 
well since the financial crisis.

However, behind the overall picture is a divide, where household finances in particular have 
been strong. Their disposable incomes have increased every year during and since the crisis 
(see  Figure  1).  Growth  in  consumption  has  also  been  good.  Housing  prices  and  loans  to 
households have increased rapidly, probably partly due to strong households finances and 
an  expansionary  monetary  policy  (see  Figures  2  and  3).  Developments  in  the  corporate 
sector have been weaker, which is reflected in weak growth in exports, low investment and 
only modest growth in loans to companies (see Figure 4).

 The division in the economy is a problem for monetary policy. With only one tool, the repo 
rate,  we  are  trying  to  attain  the  inflation  target  and  at  the  same  time  attain  a  balanced 
development  in  economic  activity.  In  practice,  the  repo  rate  is  often  adequate  as a  tool  to 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

give both inflation and economic activity a push in the right direction.1 But in recent years, we 
have  also  needed  to  manage  the  problem  of  economic  activity  being  at  different  levels  in 
different parts of the economy. We cannot use the repo rate to stimulate the corporate sector 
and limit the build-up of household debt all at the same time. In this situation, it is not evident 
how  monetary  policy  should  manage  the  balance  between  inflation,  economic  activity  and 
the risk of an overly rapid increase in housing prices and household credit. Let me elaborate 
on my thoughts a little further here. 
Monetary policy must take financial risks into account 
The concern over lending to households increasing too rapidly has led to a majority of the 
members  of  the  Riksbank’s  Executive  Board  voting  to  hold  the  repo  rate  at  a  higher  level 
than  would  otherwise  have  been  justified.  I  have  entered  reservations  against  these 
decisions  and  advocated  a  lower  repo  rate,  for  reasons  I  will  return  to  later.  Despite  my 
reservations, I share the majority’s concern over the rapid increase in household debt. And I 
consider that monetary policy should, in principle, take into account financial imbalances and 
risks that may arise as a result of the monetary policy conducted. 
In what way is this compatible with the Riksbank’s mandate? 
According  to  the  Sveriges  Riksbank  Act,  the  objective  of  the  Riksbank’s  activities  is  to 
maintain price stability. Moreover, the Riksbank shall promote a safe and efficient payment 
system.  In  addition,  the  preliminary  works  to  the  Act  state  that  the  Riksbank,  without 
prejudice  to  the  price  stability  target,  should  support  the  goals  of  general  economic  policy 
with a view to maintaining a sustainable level of growth and high rate of employment. 
At the Riksbank we consider the task of promoting a safe and efficient payment system to 
have  a  broad  meaning  and  that  it  is,  in  practice,  a  matter  of  taking  responsibility  for 
promoting  the  stability  of  the  financial  system.2  But  it  is  not  actually  this  task  that  justifies 
monetary policy taking into account a rapid expansion in household borrowing. It is namely 
the  case  that  the  preliminary  works  to  the  Sveriges  Riksbank  Act  emphasise  that  the 
monetary  policy  instruments  shall  only  be  used  to  maintain  price  stability,  and  thus  not  to 
promote a safe and efficient payment system.3 
We sometimes say that monetary policy shall take financial risks into account, as it can be 
difficult to stabilise inflation around the target if households are forced to rapidly reduce their 
debts.4  Such  difficulties  could  arise,  of  course,  but  for  me  it  is  not  consideration  of  the 
inflation target that mainly justifies letting monetary policy take financial risks into account. 
Instead I perceive taking financial risks into account to follow on from the task of “supporting 
the objectives of general economic policy with the aim of achieving sustainable growth”. A 
monetary policy that leads to an unhealthy build-up of credit or other financial imbalances is 
scarcely compatible with sustainable growth. 
But  this  task,  like  the  task  of  stabilising  economic  activity,  is  subordinate  to  the  inflation 
target. Monetary policy’s consideration of financial risks must therefore be weighed against 
the inflation target and economic developments.  
                                                 
1  For a tool to be sufficient to meet the inflation target and attain a balanced development in economic activity, it 
is  necessary  for  the  economy  to  mostly  suffer  demand  shocks,  not  supply  shocks.  This  observation  is 
sometimes called the divine coincidence, an expression coined by Blanchard and Gali (2007).

From principle to practice 
The  question  is  then  how  the  principle  of  consideration  of  financial  risks  and  imbalances 
should be put into practice in monetary policy. How should the balance between the different 
tasks be managed? 
When determining this we must consider whether other tools than monetary policy are more 
suitable  for  managing  financial  risks,  whether  our  concerns  regarding  household  debt  are 
justified and what effects monetary policy has on the imbalances and risks that concern us. 
I  do  not  intend  to  conduct  any  deep  discussion  of  the  links  between  monetary  policy  and 
other  tools  today.  As  expressed  by  the  Riksbank  (2010),  I  note  that  it  is  not  primarily 
monetary  policy,  but  an  efficient  regulatory  framework  and  supervision  that  is  important  to 
prevent  financial  imbalances.  The  way  in  which  monetary  policy  should  take  into  account 
financial risks may therefore depend on the formulation of the regulatory framework and the 
supervision.  I  shall  return  to  this  question  when  I  discuss  the  new  framework  for 
macroprudential policy. 
Household indebtedness is worryingly high 
Also, I do not wish to get into a detailed discussion now as to whether the concern over rising 
house prices and household debt in recent decades is justified.5 It is clear to me that we do 
not fully understand what the underlying factors are. We therefore do not know whether the 
upturn is largely explained by fundamental factors or whether it reflects imbalances that have 
built up in the economy.  
Fundamentals that we are not able to disregard include the fact that housing construction is 
low  and  has  been  so  for  a  number  of  years.  A  low  level  of  construction,  combined  with  a 
growing  population  and  a  move  to  metropolitan  areas  also  contribute  to  a  rise  in  housing 
prices,  and  ultimately  to  an  increase  in  debt.  And  the  conversion  of  rental  properties  to 
tenant-owned  properties  also  contributes  to  increased  debt.  A  further  aspect  is  that 
household savings are high and have increased at the same time as debt has increased. 
But high indebtedness probably means that the economy will be more sensitive to shocks, 
even if it can be explained by fundamentals. An economic downturn could then be reinforced 
by households with large debts trying to increase their saving by reducing their consumption. 
Moreover, we can hardly rule out the possibility that households’ increased indebtedness in 
recent  years  has  at  least  partly  been  caused  by  unrealistically  low  expectations  of  future 
mortgage rates. In my opinion, it is therefore in principle justified for monetary policy to now 
take into account the rapid increase in household indebtedness. 
Risks with a low repo rate 
A  further  question  is  thus  in  what  way  monetary  policy  can  lead  to  financial  imbalances 
building up. International academic research discusses several potential problems that can 
arise if a central bank holds its policy rate at a low level for a long period of time. Perhaps the 
most common problem mentioned is that investors will then seek assets with a higher yield, 
which also have a higher risk. One of many reasons for such behaviour could be that some 
portfolio managers are required to attain a minimum return on their portfolios. This behaviour 
risks causing an unwarranted rise in asset prices when interest rates are low.6 
                                                 
5  There  is  a  lively  debate  on  this  question.  One  important  contribution  to  the  discussion  is  the  Riksbank’s 
commission  of  inquiry  into  risks  on  the  Swedish  housing  market  (Riksbank  2011).  The  National  Institute  of 
Economic  Research  (2013)  and  Svensson  (2013a)  are  examples  of  newer  contributions  to  the  debate, 
claiming that housing prices and household indebtedness do not comprise an evident problem. 
6  See Rajan (2005).

Another possible problem with low interest rates is that the monetary policy stimulus can help 
weak  companies  to  get  along  without  having  to  deal  with  their  problems.  In  this  way,  a 
necessary structural transformation in the economy may be postponed. There is also a risk 
that the stimulus will help the banks to struggle along with weak balance sheets, which will 
inhibit credit granting in the economy.7 
The  problems  I  have  just  mentioned  nevertheless  appear  less  relevant  to  current 
developments in Sweden. But I would like to mention two other potential problems linked to 
low interest rates, which I think justify the concern over the Swedish economy. 
My first source of concern is perhaps a little far-fetched.8 Let us say that for some reason we 
find  ourselves  in  a  situation  where  the  repo  rate  is  low  and  many  households  are  heavily 
indebted. In this situation a repo-rate increase could have large negative consequences for 
the indebted households and consequently for the economy as a whole. Then households 
might  believe  that  future  economic  policy  will  be  formulated  so  that  such  negative 
consequences are avoided or alleviated. They may then choose to take on even higher debts 
if  they  believe  –  with  or  without  justification  –  that  economic  policy  will  take  this  into 
consideration. And these problems risk increasing the longer the repo rate is kept at a low 
level.

A  more  tangible  source  of  concern  is  households’  expectations  of  future  interest  rates. 
Surveys show that households (and market agents, for that matter) are expecting much lower 
interest rates in the longer run than we at the Riksbank are expecting (see Figures 5 and 6).9

One  possible  interpretation  of  these  expectations  is  that  households  place  too  much 
emphasis on the low interest rates in recent years when they are looking ahead. In this case, 
further repo-rate cuts risk reinforcing the difference between households’ expectations and 
the  Riksbank’s  expectations  of  future  interest  rates.  And  such  incorrect  expectations  may 
then lead to unwarranted increases in housing prices and household indebtedness. 
But I would like to point out that it is genuinely difficult to know what will be a “normal” or 
average level for future mortgage rates. It is not at all certain that the Riksbank’s long-run 
assessments  of  the  repo  rate  are  more  correct  than  those  of  households  or  other  market 
agents. 
A low repo rate is necessary, despite the risks 
I have observed that there are risks linked to holding a low repo rate over a long period of 
time, and that monetary policy should in principle take these risks into account. But at the 
                                                 
9  At the Riksbank, we usually  say that the average repo rate in the longer run can be expected to be in the 
interval of 3.5 to 4.5 per cent (see, for instance, the Riksbank 2013b, p. 47). Short-term mortgage rates are 
usually 1.5 to 2 percentage points higher. Households’ expectations of short-term mortgage rates five years 
ahead  are  now  around  4  per  cent.  And  market  agents’  expectations  of  the  repo  rate  five  years  ahead  are 
around 3 per cent. See Figure 5 and Figure 6.

most recent monetary policy meetings I have nevertheless advocated cutting the repo rate 
even lower. 
There are several factors behind this stance. Firstly, a lower repo rate would mean that CPIF 
inflation returns to 2 per cent even faster and that resource utilisation is more balanced than 
in our forecasts (see Figure 7).

 Secondly,  I  have  seen  an  incipient  credibility  problem  and  wanted  to  formulate  monetary 
policy so that it appears well-balanced even when combined with assessments made outside 
of the Riksbank. The problems I have seen are based on a combination of inflation having 
clearly  undershot  the  target,  the  Riksbank’s  inflation  forecasts  having  been  more  optimistic 
than those of other analysts, the Executive Board’s repo-rate paths having indicated a tighter 
monetary policy than the market and analysts have expected and the repo-rate paths having 
been revised down time after time. I have said that in such a situation it is better to cut the rate 
immediately  rather  than  continuing  to  present  a  repo-rate  path  that  is  not  perceived  by 
outsiders as entirely credible. However, these problems have become a little less important in 
recent months as other analysts’ forecasts of inflation and the repo rate have been revised up. 
Thirdly, it is not self-evident that taking into account household debt means setting a higher 
repo  rate  than  we  would  otherwise  have  done.  The  current  repo  rate,  1  per  cent,  is 
undeniably low. In the long run, the repo rate will be raised to much higher levels. But we 
cannot raise the repo rate until we see that inflation has clearly begun to move towards the 
target of 2 per cent. And when this happens will of course depend on monetary policy. If we 
cut  the  repo  rate  now,  inflation  will  rise  faster  towards  the  target.  If  the  repo  rate  is  left 
unchanged it will take longer before inflation begins to rise, and this in turn means that it will 
take a long time before the repo rate can be raised. It is not even self-evident that inflation 
will return to the target level in the long run if monetary policy is too tight. 
If we are worried that a long period with a low repo rate will give rise to an unjustified upturn 
in  housing  prices  and  indebtedness,  we  should  perhaps  ensure  we  conduct  a  monetary 
policy that means we quickly move towards the inflation target, and that still works even if 
8

economic  developments  are  less  favourable  than  forecast  in  our  main  scenario.  Such  a 
monetary policy could entail cutting the repo rate now to increase inflation and then raising 
the repo rate slightly faster in the coming period when inflation accelerates (see Figure 7). 
Admittedly,  preliminary  assessments  within  the  Riksbank,  based  on  model  calculations 
combined  with  empirical  relationships,  indicate  that  a  large  repo-rate  cut  now,  followed  by 
faster  increases  in  the  future  would  entail  slightly  higher  risks  linked  to  household 
indebtedness than if the repo-rate path advocated by the majority is followed. However, the 
difference in the risk outlook for these two alternatives is almost negligible. A lower repo rate 
now and faster increases in the coming period seems to me a better monetary policy, when 
weighing the risks against the opportunity to return to the inflation target sooner and to have 
a more balanced resource utilisation (see Figure 7).10 
The  assessments  and  calculations  I  refer  to  here  are  based  on  the  general  framework 
presented in our Monetary Policy Report published in July.11 It is not entirely clear how this 
reasoning should be translated into recommendations for practical monetary policy. We are 
working on this issue within the bank. It scarcely needs to be said that the assessments and 
calculations  I  have  implied  today  are  uncertain,  and  that  they  will  remain  uncertain  even 
when work on these issues has progressed further.12 
Further measures are needed to strengthen financial stability 
In  conclusion,  I  would  like  to  discuss  how  the  new  framework  for  macroprudential  policy 
affects my view of how monetary policy should be conducted. 
It is good that one single authority, Finansinspektionen (the Swedish Financial Supervisory 
Authority), is given a clear responsibility for decisions on supervisory measures. In this way, 
we avoid the problem that different authorities may try to put responsibility on others, which 
could have arisen if the responsibility was shared between several authorities. 
At the same time, it is positive that several authorities, including the Riksbank, are given a 
role to play in the work on macroprudential policy through the new financial stability council. 
Identifying and analysing factors that can give rise to financial imbalances is and will remain 
an  important  part  of  the  Riksbank’s  work.  The  Riksbank  needs  this  analysis  for  several 
reasons.  As  I  mentioned  earlier,  the  Riksbank  has  responsibility  for  promoting  a  safe  and 
efficient payment system. We must also understand if monetary policy risks contributing to 
financial  imbalances  arising.  Moreover,  a  development  of  the  economy  that  proves  to  be 
unsustainable will affect the way in which inflation develops and what type of monetary policy 
it is appropriate to conduct. The financial stability council will give us a forum where we can 
and shall openly present our analyses of financial risks and recommendations for supervisory 
measures. 
In the recent Monetary Policy Update our forecasts was based on no new macroprudential 
policy  measures  being  introduced.  But  how  will  my  view  of  a  suitable  monetary  policy  be 
affected if such measures are implemented? 
The answer depends entirely on the measures implemented and their effects. 
                                                 
10  The scenarios shown in Figure 7 should primarily be regarded as an illustration of the different alternatives. 
The repo-rate path there does not coincide with the one I have advocated at the monetary policy meetings.  
11  The Riksbank (2013c). 
12  A  central  element  of  uncertainty  is  how  the  repo  rate  affects  the  degree  of  household  indebtedness.  The 
Riksbank’s estimates imply that the debt ratio will increase when the repo rate is cut, but that the increase will 
be small. Svensson (2013b) says on the other hand that a lower repo rate would entail a lower debt ratio. But 
in his model there is no real reason to be concerned over household indebtedness, regardless of how the repo 
rate affects the degree of household indebtedness. For example, he does not allow for households’ interest-
rate expectations becoming unjustifiably low if the repo rate is cut.

Supervisory measures can have direct effects on financial risks and imbalances by limiting 
the  possibilities  of  particularly  vulnerable  households,  companies  or  banks  to  take  certain 
decisions. However, the measures may also have indirect effects on risks and imbalances, or 
side effects on the economy by affecting the cost of capital or the general demand situation. 
An example of a measure that probably first and foremost has direct effects is the mortgage 
cap. This affects primarily a small group of highly-indebted households and can be expected 
to contribute substantially to preventing financial imbalances arising. But the mortgage cap 
scarcely  has  any  major  effects  on  the  general  demand  in  the  economy,  or  on  the  cost  of 
capital for a typical household. 
An  example  of  a  measure  that  can  affect  the  cost  of  capital  is  higher  risk  weights  on 
mortgages. Such a measure would probably lead to an increase in mortgage rates in relation 
to other lending rates. And higher risk weights would probably also push up average lending 
rates at a given repo rate, at least in the short run. 
As I in practice have not let concern for households’ rapid build-up of debt affect my view of 
how  the  repo  rate  should  be  set  today,  measures  of  the  first  type,  that  is,  measures  that 
directly  limit  vulnerable  households’  opportunities  to  become  or  remain  heavily  indebted, 
would probably also have little effect on my choice of repo rate and repo-rate path. On the 
other hand, measures that entail an increase in the average lending rates or a weakening of 
general demand would justify cutting the repo rate. The purpose would then be to counteract 
the  effects  of  the  supervisory  measure  on  total  economic  developments.  However,  the 
supervision  measures  could  nevertheless  affect  financial  imbalances,  for  instance,  by 
changing the level of household mortgage rates in relation to companies’ borrowing rates. 
Further macroprudential policy measures thus need not change my view of which monetary 
policy  is  most  appropriate  now.  However,  such  measures  are  nevertheless  important  to 
monetary policy as they can reduce risks and uncertainties. It is easier to conduct monetary 
policy if financial stability is good.
