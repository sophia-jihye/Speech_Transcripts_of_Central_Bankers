 Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy 
Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Kochi 
Hiroshi Nakaso 
Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
It  is  my  pleasure  to  have  the  opportunity  today  to  exchange  views  with  administrative, 
financial, and business leaders in Kochi Prefecture. I would like to take this opportunity to 
express  my  sincerest  gratitude  for  your  cooperation  with  the  activities  of  the  Bank  of 
Japan's Kochi Branch. Today, I would like to have your views on the actual situation of the 
local economy, as well as your candid opinions about the Bank's policies and activities. Let 
me now start by talking about the Bank's outlook for Japan's economic activity and prices as 
well as its thinking behind the conduct of monetary policy, while outlining the  Outlook for 
Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report) released at the end of January 2017. 
 I. Recent Developments in and Outlook for Economic Activity at Home and Abroad 
Japan's economy has continued its moderate recovery trend. As for the outlook, it is likely 
to  continue  growing  at  a  pace  above  its  potential  on  the  back  of  highly  accommodative 
financial conditions and the effects of the government's large-scale stimulus measures, with 
the growth rates in overseas economies increasing moderately. Specifically, the medians of 
the Policy Board members' forecasts of the real GDP growth rates presented in the January 
2017 Outlook Report were 1.4 percent for fiscal 2016, 1.5 percent for fiscal 2017, and 1.1 
percent for fiscal 2018, above Japan's potential growth rate, which is estimated to be around 
0.5  percent  (Chart  1).  Compared  to  the  previous  forecasts  released  at  the  beginning  of 
November 2016, the projected growth rates are somewhat higher, reflecting improvement in 
overseas  economies  and  the  yen's  depreciation  in  addition  to  the  effects  of  the 
comprehensive revision to GDP statistics. In what follows, I will explain the background to 
these projections. 
 Overseas Economies 
First,  I  will  touch  on  developments  in  overseas  economies.  As  you  all  know,  in  financial 
markets, a pessimistic view had prevailed regarding the outlook until around autumn 2016. 
With the benefit of hindsight, however, the momentum for global economic growth seems 
to  have  strengthened  since  mid-2016.  In  particular,  improvement  in  manufacturing  and 
trade  has  been  notable.  An  uptrend  has  become  evident  recently  in  indicators  related  to 
business sentiment of the manufacturing sector globally, mainly on the back of an increase 
in IT-related demand led by that for smartphones and of the progress observed in emerging 
economies in inventory adjustments of materials (Chart 2). In Asian emerging economies, 
 1 
domestic  demand  has  been  resilient,  reflecting  the  effects  of  the  economic  stimulus 
measures implemented to date, and IT-related and material-related exports have picked up. 
The Chinese economy has continued to see stable growth on the whole, supported by policy 
effects resulting from such factors as a rise in public investment and a sales tax cut on small 
cars. Meanwhile, a recovery in advanced economies, which had been led by the household 
sector,  has  spread  to  the  corporate  sector  recently.  Reflecting  such  recovery  in  global 
demand, commodity prices, including crude oil prices, bottomed out in the first half of 2016 
and have started to rise. 
 Since the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, stock prices and long-term interest 
rates  have  risen  globally.  This  is  certainly  attributable  to  the  expectations  for  the  new 
administration's  stimulative  economic  policy,  but  improvement  in  fundamentals  also 
appears to underlie this development. 
 In terms of the outlook, advanced economies are expected to continue growing steadily, and 
a recovery in emerging economies is likely to take hold gradually on the back of the steady 
growth  in  advanced  economies  and  the  effects  of  economic  stimulus  measures  taken  by 
emerging economies. Looking at the weighted averages of projected real GDP growth rates 
of individual economies and regions released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 
January 2017, by value of exports from Japan, the growth rates of overseas economies are 
projected to increase through 2018; compared to the time when the October 2016 Outlook 
Report was published, the weighted average has been revised upward marginally (Chart 3). 
 Corporate Sector 
Reflecting  such  improvement  in  overseas  economies,  a  pick-up  in  Japan's  exports  and 
production  has  become evident  (Chart  4).  Exports and  production  have  started  to  increase 
since  around  last  summer,  but  this  had  been  supported  by  temporary  factors  such  as  an 
acceleration  of  automobile  production  to  more  than  offset  the  impact  of  the  Kumamoto 
Earthquake;  however,  they  have  maintained  their  uptrend  thereafter  and  there  is  a  steady 
rise  in  the  number  of  items  for  which  volume  increased.  The  recovery  in  exports  and 
production has been even more persistent, reflecting the progress in inventory adjustments, 
mainly in capital goods and producer goods, in addition to a moderate increase in demand at 
home  and  abroad.  As  for  the  outlook,  exports  and  production  are  projected  to  moderately 
 2 
increase, with the growth rates in overseas economies increasing moderately. 
 In  this  situation,  corporate  profits  have  been  at  around  the  historical  high  levels  and  are 
projected to follow a steady increasing trend on the back of an increase in demand at home 
and abroad and the yen's depreciation. Against the background of such favorable corporate 
profits,  business  fixed  investment  is  expected  to  rise  steadily,  backed  by  an  increase  in 
growth  expectations  and  a  rise  in  demand  related  to  the  2020  Tokyo  Olympics  as  well  as 
accommodative financial conditions. According to the December 2016 Tankan (Short-Term 
Economic  Survey  of  Enterprises  in  Japan),  corporate  profits  have  continued  to  be  at  high 
levels and firmness has continued to be seen in business fixed investment plans as a whole. 
 Household Sector 
Meanwhile,  despite  the  steady  improvement  in  the  employment  and  income  situation, 
private consumption had been somewhat weak since the beginning of 2016, but it has been 
on  an  improving  trend  recently.  As  I  mentioned  earlier,  in  the  first  half  of  last  year, 
consumer  sentiment  became  cautious,  reflecting  the  slowdown  in  the  global  economy  -- 
mainly  the  emerging  economies  --  and  a  subsequent  decline  in  stock  prices,  as  well  as 
irregular weather. However, it has improved recently, partly reflecting a rise in stock prices, 
and private consumption has started  to overcome the weakness observed before (Chart 5). 
In addition to services such as dining-out, which had remained relatively firm, an improving 
trend  has  become  clear  in  sales  of  durable  goods  --  such  as  automobiles  and  household 
electrical appliances -- and sales at supermarkets and convenience stores. The Consumption 
Activity  Index  (CAI),  which  the  Bank  calculates  by  combining  various  sales  and 
supply-side statistics, has picked up since last summer. 
 Going  forward,  private  consumption  is  expected  to  increase  moderately.  What  underpins 
this  is  the  steady  improvement  in  the  employment  and  income  situation.  With  regard  to 
supply-demand  conditions  in  the  labor  market,  the  active  job  openings-to-applicants  ratio 
and  the  diffusion  index  (DI)  for  employment  conditions  in  the  December  Tankan  have 
improved to almost the same levels seen around 1991-1992 (Chart 6). The unemployment 
rate  has  declined  to  around  3  percent  recently,  which  is  virtually  full  employment.  Under 
these  circumstances,  wages  have  risen  moderately,  albeit  with  some  fluctuations.  In 
particular, the year-on-year rate of change in hourly cash earnings of part-time employees, 
 3 
which are responsive to labor market conditions, has seen a relatively high increase,  being 
in  the  range  of  around  1.5-2.0  percent.  It  is  expected  that  more  and  more  firms  will  raise 
wages, partly through a base pay rise. 
 Upside and Downside Risks 
I  have  explained  so  far  the  baseline  scenario  of  Japan's  economic  outlook  through  fiscal 
2018. However, it should be noted that the outlook entails risks, and uncertainty regarding 
developments in overseas economies warrants particular attention. 
 Specifically, first of all, developments in the U.S. economy and the impact of its monetary 
policy on global financial markets should be noted. The details for economic policy of the 
new U.S. administration are still uncertain, but it is expected that proactive fiscal measures 
such as a tax cut and infrastructure investment will lead to rises in the economic growth rate 
and the inflation rate. In this situation, the short- and long-term interest rates in the United 
States are expected to rise, and how this affects global financial markets  -- including those 
of  the  emerging  economies  --  warrants  attention.  Other  risks  to  which  we  need  to  pay 
attention  include  (1)  developments  in  emerging  and  commodity-exporting  economies, 
particularly China, (2) the consequences stemming from the United Kingdom's vote to leave 
the European Union (EU) and their effects, and (3) prospects regarding the European debt 
problem, including the financial sector. 
 These  risks,  if  manifested,  are  likely  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  economic  activity. 
However,  they  could  have  a  positive  impact  as  well.  If  market  participants  and  economic 
entities factor the risks in to a certain extent, the confidence in the economic outlook going 
forward would be enhanced, leading to an upswing in economic activity, when (1) the view 
prevails that the actual impact may not be as significant as envisioned beforehand or (2) the 
probability of manifestation of these risks lessens. What happened after the referendum on 
Brexit is a case in point. Therefore, we should monitor developments in overseas economies 
with both upside and downside risks in mind.

II. Price Developments and their Outlook 
Price Developments 
Next, I will talk about the price developments in Japan. Almost four years have passed since 
the  Bank  introduced  quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary  easing  (QQE)  in  April  2013. 
During this period, Japan's price developments have improved considerably (Chart 7). Since 
autumn 2014, crude oil prices have declined significantly, pushing down consumer prices. 
However, looking at the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) for 
all  items  less  fresh  food  and  energy,  which  had  been  in  negative  territory  for  a  prolonged 
period before the introduction of QQE, it became positive in autumn 2013 and has remained 
in positive territory for over three years. Japan's economy is no longer in deflation, which is 
generally defined as a sustained decline in prices. 
 Nevertheless,  it  is  true  that  there  is  still  a  long  way  to  go  to  achieve  the  Bank's  price 
stability target of 2 percent. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI for all items less 
fresh  food  and  energy  has  remained  on  a  decelerating  trend  since  the  beginning  of  2016; 
thereafter,  the  rate  of  change  has  been  fluctuating.  This  is  attributable  to  a  slowdown  in 
firms' price hikes reflecting sluggish private consumption, and to price declines such as in 
durable  goods,  due  mainly  to  the  yen's  appreciation  last  year.  From  a  longer-term 
perspective, people's inflation expectations also have declined, following the course of the 
observed  inflation  rate,  which  has  continued  to  show  somewhat  weak  developments  with 
the decline in crude oil prices that has lasted for about two and a half years. 
 Outlook for Prices 
While  recent  price  developments  have  been  somewhat  sluggish,  the  Bank  judges  that  the 
momentum  toward  achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent  is  maintained. 
Specifically, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI for all items less fresh food is likely 
to increase from about 0 percent and become slightly positive, reflecting a bottoming out of 
crude oil prices, and thereafter is expected to increase toward 2 percent. The timing of the 
year-on-year rate of change in the CPI reaching around 2 percent will likely be at the end of 
the projection period of the Outlook Report  -- that is, around fiscal 2018. This outlook for 
prices is unchanged from that presented in the October 2016 Outlook Report. 
  5 
Going forward, the inflation rate is expected to rise through the following mechanism. First, 
the  output  gap  has  improved  steadily,  as  evidenced  by  the  tightening  of  labor  market 
conditions, and this will lead to a rise in the inflation rate through wage increases and other 
channels. Second, a pick-up in commodity prices, including crude oil prices, and the yen's 
depreciation are expected to push up consumer prices. Third, along with these developments, 
people's medium- to long-term inflation expectations are likely to rise. 
 The  tightening  of  labor  market  conditions  brings  about  upward  pressure  on  wages.  The 
Bank aims to achieve a situation where the inflation rate increases moderately, accompanied 
by  rises  in  corporate  profits  and  wages.  The  past  data  show  that  the  rates  of  increase  in 
wages and prices move almost in parallel. From this perspective, we are very interested in 
how  the  labor-management  wage  negotiations  in  the  coming  months  will play  out,  as  was 
the  case  last  year.  The  conditions  for  wage  increases  have  been  met  largely  as  the  labor 
market  conditions  have  tightened  with  corporate  profits  at  high  levels.  The  Bank  strongly 
expects that both labor and management will negotiate by making the most of the favorable 
conditions, leading to a virtuous cycle of the economy. 
 The effects of declines such as that in crude oil prices -- which had been exerting downward 
pressure  on  consumer  prices  --  will  dissipate  through  the  end  of  fiscal  2016  and  push  up 
consumer  prices  thereafter.  Specifically,  the  negative  contribution  of  energy  items  to 
consumer prices has lessened gradually and is expected to reach around 0 percentage point 
in  early  2017.  The  contribution  is  estimated  to  be  slightly  positive  in  fiscal  2017  on  the 
assumption that crude oil prices will increase at a fairly moderate pace in line with what the 
futures prices imply. 
 As  I  mentioned  earlier,  inflation  expectations  in  Japan  tend  to  be  largely  affected  by  the 
observed  inflation  rate.  This  mechanism  is  called  the  adaptive  formation  mechanism  of 
inflation  expectations.  The  decline  in  crude  oil  prices  since  autumn  2014  had  exerted 
downward  pressure  on  inflation  expectations  through  the  adaptive  formation  mechanism. 
Looking  ahead,  however,  this  effect  is  likely  to  be  neutral  to  inflation  expectations  or 
slightly push them up. The direct impact on consumer prices of a rise in crude oil prices and 
the  yen's  depreciation  are  observed  only  temporarily  and  will  dissipate  after  a  while. 
Nonetheless,  if  these  developments  lead  to  a  rise  in  medium-  to  long-term  inflation 
 6 
expectations,  there  will  be  a  persistent  rise  in  the  inflation  rate.  The  Bank  expects  that 
people's  inflation  expectations  will  follow  an  increasing  trend  and  converge  to  2  percent, 
supported also by the Bank's strong commitment to achieving the price stability target of 2 
percent. 
 III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy 
Next, I would like to talk about the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. In September 2016, 
the  Bank  introduced  "QQE  with  Yield  Curve  Control"  --  a  new  framework  for  monetary 
easing -- and thereby strengthened the two previous policy frameworks of QQE and "QQE 
with a Negative Interest Rate." 
 This framework consists of two components (Chart 8). The first is the yield curve control in 
which the Bank controls short- and long-term interest rates. This is designed to facilitate the 
formation  of  short-  and  long-term  interest  rates  that  are  considered  most  appropriate  for 
maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, taking 
account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. At 
present, in the guideline for market operations, the Bank sets the short-term policy interest 
rate at minus 0.1 percent and the target level of the 10-year JGB yields at around 0 percent, 
conducting JGB purchases so as to achieve this target level. 
 The  second  component  is  an  inflation-overshooting  commitment.  This  is  a  strong 
commitment that the Bank will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year 
rate of increase in the observed CPI exceeds 2 percent and stays above that level in a stable 
manner.  As  I  explained  earlier,  taking  into  account  that  inflation  expectation  formation  is 
largely adaptive in Japan, it is crucial that the public actually experience inflation above 2 
percent in order to raise inflation expectations to 2 percent and anchor them at that level. By 
demonstrating  its  strong  determination  to  achieve  the  price  stability  target  through  this 
commitment, the Bank aims to enhance its credibility with the public that it will achieve 2 
percent and to raise inflation expectations in a more forceful manner. 
 This  framework  is  designed  to  amplify  monetary  easing  effects  when  the  outlook  for 
economic  activity  and  prices  improves.  This  is  because,  while  there  would  be  upward 
pressure  on  interest  rates  in  accordance  with  such  improvement,  the  degree  of  monetary 
 7 
easing will increase through a decline in real interest rates against a rise in the natural rate 
of interest if the Bank contains such upward pressure and thereby maintains the shape of the 
yield curve. 
 With  regard  to  the  future  conduct  of  monetary  policy,  the  Bank  decides  the  guideline  for 
market operations at each Monetary Policy Meeting with a view to facilitating the formation 
of  a  yield  curve  that  is  deemed  most  appropriate  for  maintaining  the  momentum  toward 
achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent,  taking  account  of  developments  in 
economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. 
 Some market participants, taking account of a rise in interest rates overseas, argue that the 
Bank might consider raising the target level of the long-term interest rate in the near future. 
However, as described in the Outlook Report, although the momentum toward achieving the 
price  stability  target  of  2  percent  has  been  maintained,  it  is  not  yet  sufficiently  firm  and 
there is still a long way to go to achieve the target. In addition, the risks to the outlook for 
economic  activity  and  prices  seem  to  remain  skewed  to  the  downside,  particularly  those 
regarding  developments  in  overseas  economies  and  medium-  to  long-term  inflation 
expectations. Under these circumstances, I believe it is of utmost importance at the current 
phase that the Bank persistently pursue powerful monetary easing under "QQE with Yield 
Curve Control." 
 Conclusion 
Lastly, let me touch on the economy of Kochi Prefecture. 
 The  economy  of  Kochi  Prefecture  is  currently  recovering  moderately.  The  region  is 
benefiting from the recovery trend of the global economy mentioned earlier, which means 
that exports to emerging economies are increasing and production is picking up. 
 Looking at the demand side, public investment and housing investment are increasing, and 
firms are maintaining a proactive business fixed investment stance against the backdrop of 
high  levels  of  corporate  profits.  Moreover,  positive  developments  also  can  be  observed  in 
private  consumption,  such  as  a  pick-up  in  car  sales  reflecting  the  release  of  new  models. 
Needless  to  say,  the  background  to  this  development  in  private  consumption  is  the 
 8 
improvement 
in 
the 
employment 
and 
income 
situation.  The 
active 
job 
openings-to-applicants  ratio  in  Kochi  Prefecture  surpassed  the  long-hoped-for  ratio  of  1  a 
year ago and has continued to follow an uptrend since then. On this basis, wages are rising 
and employee income is following a moderate increasing trend. 
 However,  the  background  to  this  increase  in  the  active  job  openings-to-applicants  ratio  is 
not only the improvement in the business cycle but also labor shortages due to the decline in 
and aging of the population, which is more than ten years ahead of the national trend. This 
population  decline  creates  a  major  issue;  namely,  a  shrinking  of  the  regional  demand  in 
Kochi Prefecture. 
 In order to tackle this issue, the prefecture has been forging ahead with the Kochi Prefecture 
Industrial  Promotion  Plan  since  fiscal  2009.  Under  the  slogans  "local  production  for 
external  sales"  and  "extended  reproduction,"  the  plan  aims  to  strengthen  the  prefecture's 
food and tourism industries by making use of the agriculture, forestry, and fishery industries, 
which are the region's forte, and to expand sales channels outside the prefecture and abroad. 
In  line  with  this  plan,  efforts toward the "sixth-order  industry" utilizing specialties such as 
yuzu, chestnut, and bonito have been making progress in various places in the prefecture, and 
the value of production  in  that  industry is also rising.  In addition, an increasing number of 
firms  are  developing  products  that  take  advantage  of  local  uniqueness  and  traditional 
technologies and promoting both domestic and international sales channels.  These  include, 
for example, firms specializing in disaster-related products utilizing technologies unique to 
the  region,  which  has  a  high  awareness  of  the  need  for  disaster  prevention,  and  those 
making competitive paper products that take advantage of the Tosa Japanese paper tradition. 
In fact, some of these firms are leaders in their particular niche, holding large market shares 
both domestically and abroad. 
 In  terms  of  tourism,  a  variety  of  initiatives  have  been  producing  steady  results.  Kochi 
Prefecture is home to a considerable number of important historical figures such as Ryoma 
Sakamoto, a patriot samurai in the closing days of the Tokugawa shogunate, and is a region 
endowed with an enterprising spirit. It also is a prefecture rich in touristic resources such as 
nature, history, and culture, as exemplified by Muroto Global Geopark and Shimanto River. 
In all parts of the prefecture, the development of touristic resources making full use of the rich 
 9 
nature, as well as of food and a culture unique to Kochi  Prefecture, is going ahead and the 
number of tourists visiting the prefecture, including foreign tourists, is on an increasing trend. 
This year and next, an expo called the "Shikoku Kochi Bakumatsu Ishinhaku" will be held to 
commemorate the 150th anniversary of Taiseihokan -- or, returning power to the Emperor -- 
and  the Meiji Restoration, and it is expected that this will provide a further boost to tourist 
numbers and help spread the word about the prefecture's attractions to the whole country. 
 In the words of Emori Ueki, a Meiji era activist born in Kochi Prefecture, "freedom comes 
from the mountains of Tosa." Given the rapid decline in and aging of the population in Kochi 
Prefecture, it is no exaggeration to say that it is a mirror that reflects the future of Japan. I 
think that the development of Kochi Prefecture's economy will serve as a signpost pointing to 
the  future  direction  of  Japan's  economy  as  a  whole,  such  that  one  might  say  that  "the 
revitalization of Japan's economy comes from the mountains of Tosa." The Bank of Japan, 
and especially the Kochi Branch, will make every effort to contribute to the revitalization of 
the region. In closing, let me express my strong hopes for the further development of Kochi 
Prefecture's economy and convey my best regards. 
 Thank you.
