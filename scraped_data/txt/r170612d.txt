The Role of Expectations in Monetary Policy: 
Evolution of Theories and the Bank of Japan's Experience 
Speech at the University of Oxford 
Haruhiko Kuroda 
Governor of the Bank of Japan 
Introduction 
I am very honored to have the opportunity to give a speech at Oxford University today. At 
the same time, it is also an extremely emotional experience from a personal point of view. 
I was a graduate student at Oxford University from 1969 to 1971 and was able to enjoy 
Oxford,  the  university,  and  its  colleges  in  my  younger  days.  I  was  dispatched  here  by 
Japan's  Ministry  of  Finance,  planning  to  study  public  finance.  However,  since  Lady 
Ursula  Kathleen  Hicks,  a  prominent  scholar  in  public  finance,  had  already  retired,  I 
decided to study monetary economics under Professor Richard Good Smethurst. In those 
days, Emeritus Professor John Richard Hicks provided a series of seminars on monetary 
economics for graduate students,  and  I  participated  in  it.  The  lectures  and  seminars at 
Oxford  gave me the opportunity to study monetary economics and monetary policy in 
earnest, but I certainly could not have imagined at the time that about half a century later 
I would give a speech here about monetary policy as Governor of the Bank of Japan.   
In my speech today, titled "The  Role  of  Expectations  in  Monetary  Policy:  Evolution  of 
Theories and the Bank of Japan's Experience," I would like to talk about the evolution of 
theoretical ideas about monetary policy and the conduct of monetary policy by the Bank 
of Japan in recent  years. In April 2013, the Bank of Japan introduced quantitative and 
qualitative  monetary  easing  (QQE),  which  considerably  differs  from  the  policy 
framework  employed  until  then  and  which  has  since  been  further  enhanced  and 
strengthened.  These  policies  conducted  by  the  Bank  of  Japan,  together  with  policy 
initiatives by central banks in Europe and the United States in recent years, are frequently 
classified  as  unconventional  monetary  policies.  However,  the  roots  of  the  ideas 
underlying  these  policies  can  be  traced  back  to  work  by  economists  in  the  United 
Kingdom nearly a century ago. In today's speech, I would like to provide an overview of 
the debate in economics since the first half of the 20th century, discuss the implications 
for monetary policy today, and consider remaining issues.

I. Intellectual Origins: Monetary  Policy  Discussions by  Economists  in  the  United 
Kingdom in the First Half of the 20th Century 
Monetary policy discussions by economists in the United Kingdom in the first half of the 
20th  century  provide  extremely  useful  insights  into  monetary  policy  today.  I  am 
particularly  surprised  by  the  fact  that  those  insights  from  almost  a  century  ago  are 
relevant to the unconventional monetary policies in advanced economies in recent years. 
A British economist in  the first half of the 20th century that everyone first and foremost 
thinks  of  probably  is  John  Maynard  Keynes  (Chart  1).  Keynes,  the  founder  of 
macroeconomics,  highlighted  the  role  of  central  bank  monetary  policy  in  guiding 
long-term  interest  rates  during  a  recession  through  the  purchase  and  sale  of  long-term 
government bonds and other measures. As is well known, in 1933, Keynes sent an open 
letter to U.S. President Roosevelt, urging a reduction  of  long-term interest rates through 
purchases of long-term government bonds. 
At  the  same  time,  Keynes,  in  his  seminal  book,  The  General  Theory  of  Employment, 
Interest,  and  Money  published  in  1936,  accurately  pointed  out  that  when  long-term 
interest rates decline to certain levels, this can give rise to a "liquidity trap" -- a situation 
in  which  long-term  interest  rates  do  not  fall  further  and  the  monetary  authority  loses 
effective  control  over  interest  rates  because  people  expect  interest  rates  to  rise  in  the 
future and hold cash instead of investing in long-term bonds. What is surprising is that 
Keynes had predicted the possibility of a liquidity trap long before such a situation had 
ever arisen. In fact, although a liquidity trap had never actually arisen when the General 
Theory was written, he stated that "this limiting case might become practically important 
in future." 
As  you  all  know,  Keynes not only discussed the liquidity trap but also keenly examined 
many  other  issues  of  macroeconomics  from  an  academic  standpoint  and  had  a 
tremendous  influence  on  macroeconomic  policies  afterward.  However,  regarding  the 
topic  of  my  speech  today  --  expectations  and  monetary  policy  --  another  scholar 
providing  extremely  useful  insights  is  Ralph  George  Hawtrey,  a  close  friend  and 
 2 
intellectual sparring partner of Keynes. As a government economist known for numerous 
publications written while acting as Director of Financial Enquiries at the U.K. Treasury 
for  a  few  decades, Hawtrey devised his own economic theories rooted in practice and 
highlighted the role of monetary factors in the business cycle. 
From  an  extremely  early  stage,  he  identified  the  importance  of  conducting  monetary 
policy  in  a  forward-looking  manner  (Chart  2).  In  his  book  Monetary  Reconstruction 
published in 1923, he stated that "it is not the past rise in prices but the future rise that has 
to be counteracted." He also  pointed out that  "[t]he problem is a psychological one" and 
that "a very relevant factor in the psychological problem is the traders' expectations as to 
the intentions  of the authority which  fixes rates."  In other words,  Hawtrey highlighted 
that private entities decide their actions based on expectations for the future, identifying -- 
at this extremely early stage in the study of economics  -- that the central bank's policy 
stance toward future price stability is an important factor working on the expectations of 
such economic entities.   
Hawtrey also provides us with instructive insights about why interest rate control by the 
central bank produces significant policy effects (Chart 3). In his 1938 book A Century of 
Bank  Rate,  he  argues  that  "[t]he  pressure  applied  to  traders  by  a  moderate  rise  in  the 
short-term rate of interest,  say, 1 percent,  is  undeniably very slight.  Yet  apparently the 
Bank of England always counted on a rise of 1 percent or even  of 0.5 percent having a 
noticeable effect."  He  continues  by  stating  that, when the  Bank of England raises the 
official discount rate by 1 percent, "a trader would reason that this was intended to have a 
restrictive effect on markets, and that, if the effect was not brought about, the rate would 
simply go higher and higher till it was." Hawtrey thus probably was the first to clearly 
point out that the reason why a minor change in the  policy  interest  rate creates a major 
policy effect is people's expectations regarding the future monetary policy stance of the 
central bank. 
I  vividly  remember  hearing  about  this  last  point  from  Professor  John  Richard  Hicks 
during  my  days  at  Oxford.  However,  while  Hawtrey  called  this  policy  effect  resulting 
 3 
from  people  anticipating  the  intentions  of  the  central  bank  the  "psychological  effect," 
Hicks  argued  that  the  effect  was  based  on  extremely  rational  behavior  of  economic 
entities  (Chart  4).  From  a  theoretical  perspective,  Hicks  found  this  to  be  a  stronger 
argument with regard to the transmission mechanism of monetary policy than Hawtrey's 
argument.  Hicks  called  this  the  central  bank's  "announcement  effect,"  saying  that  the 
central bank's policy "should almost immediately result in a shift in expectations," and 
that  "[w]hat I learn from Hawtrey's analysis is that the 'classical' Bank Rate system was 
strong,  or  could  be  strong,  in  its  announcement  effects."  This  identification  of  the 
announcement  effect  by Hicks is based on the so-called expectations theory with regard 
to long-term interest rates. He  therefore can be said to have  pointed out at an early stage 
the importance of what today is called "forward guidance." 
This brief outline indicates that, nearly a century ago, British economists such as Keynes, 
Hawtrey,  and  Hicks  had  already  introduced  or  anticipated  key  concepts  related  to  the 
unconventional  monetary  policies  implemented  today,  such  as  the  liquidity  trap, 
forward-looking monetary policy, and forward guidance. Although their arguments were 
largely conceptual, they were later formalized by scholars such as Friedman and Lucas as 
well as the New Keynesians, and the essence of their arguments lives on in contemporary 
economics in a refined form. 
Central bank policy makers like myself have been influenced both directly and indirectly 
by the contributions of these British economists. Of particular importance is the point that 
a  strong  determination  by  the  central  bank  to  stabilize  prices  will  work  on  people's 
expectations and increase the effectiveness of monetary policy. This is also the essence of 
the  monetary  easing  that  the  Bank  of  Japan  is  currently  pursuing.  Based  on  these 
background  considerations,  I  would  now  like  to  explain  the  Bank  of  Japan's  policy 
conduct in recent years.

II. Deflation in Japan: Declines in Potential Growth Rate and Inflation Expectations 
Since the 1990s, economic volatility has sharply decreased in many advanced economies. 
Former  Federal  Reserve  Chairman  Ben  Bernanke  referred  to  this  as  the  "Great 
Moderation" and argued that a major reason was the dramatic improvement in the ability 
of central banks in those economies, including the United Kingdom, to stabilize inflation 
expectations through the introduction of measures such as inflation targeting. 
Meanwhile,  Japan's  economy  found  itself  in  a  completely  different  situation.  Japan 
experienced a major asset bubble from the late 1980s to the early 1990s and, following 
the  collapse  of  the  asset  bubble,  suffered  a  sharp  economic  slowdown  and  serious 
financial  instability.  Moreover,  firms  had  to  deal  with  the  so-called  three  excesses  -- 
excess  production  capacity,  excess  employment,  and  excess  debt  --  while  financial 
institutions  had  to  grapple  with  the  nonperforming  loan  problem.  While  the  negative 
legacy of the asset bubble had been more or less dealt with  by the mid-2000s, Japan's 
potential growth rate, which had been around 4 percent in the early 1990s, dropped to 
about 1 percent by the late 1990s (Chart 5). On the price front, the annual rate of change 
in  consumer  prices fell into negative territory in 1998 and generally remained negative 
over the following decade and a half. Against this background, inflation expectations also 
seem to have declined, although they were not accurately captured in a timely manner. 
On the monetary policy side, the policy interest rate, which was 6 percent  in the early 
1990s, had been lowered to 0.5 percent by 1995. At this point, conventional monetary 
easing measures through cuts in the short-term policy interest rate had been more or less 
exhausted. Paul Krugman dubbed this situation "Japan's trap"  and  stated that Japan had 
actually fallen into a liquidity trap, which had long been  regarded as just a theoretical 
possibility written in the back pages of macroeconomic textbooks. In order to get out of 
this  trap, the Bank of Japan introduced a zero interest rate policy in 1999, followed, in 
2001, by quantitative easing, in which the outstanding balance of current accounts  that 
financial institutions hold at the Bank of Japan was set as the operating target for money 
market operations. Thus, the Bank of Japan pioneered the introduction of unconventional 
 5 
monetary policies, but unfortunately Japan was unable to overcome deflation. 
Why did Japan's economy fail to get out of the liquidity trap even though the Bank of 
Japan had taken unprecedented monetary policy steps? With the benefit of hindsight, we 
now  know  that  Japan  faced  a  simultaneous  decline in the natural rate of interest and in 
inflation  expectations.  Under  these  circumstances,  as  nominal  short-term  interest  rates 
faced the zero lower bound, it was difficult to lower real interest rates to levels well below 
the  natural  rate  of  interest  and  achieve  sufficient  monetary  easing.  As  a  result,  the 
downturn  in  growth  during  this  period  caused  a  decline  in  prices,  further  reducing 
growth through the rise in real interest rates, so that weak economic growth and deflation 
reinforced each other over a long period. 
Then,  in  2008,  the  global  financial crisis  led  to  another  sharp  contraction  in  Japan's 
economy  (Chart 6).  Even though Japan's financial institutions had  already  resolved  the 
nonperforming  loan  problem  by  that  time  and  had  only  limited  exposure  to 
subprime-related products, Japan experienced a precipitous decline in real  GDP that was 
more severe than that in Europe and the United States, which was the epicenter of the 
crisis. There  are  a  number  of  reasons  for  this, but what certainly played a role is that at 
the time the policy interest rate in Japan was only 0.5 percent, so that -- unlike in Europe 
and the United States, where rate cuts of 3-4 percentage points were possible -- there was 
little room for a monetary policy response through cuts  in  the short-term  policy interest 
rate. This episode highlights the importance of bringing about an increase in the so-called 
neutral interest rate -- that is,  the nominal  interest  rate  level  that  is  neutral to  economic 
activity  --  by  anchoring  inflation  expectations  at  about  2  percent  and  of  securing  the 
ability of monetary policy to respond. 
 III. QQE: Monetary Policy to Work on Expectations 
I  took  office  as  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Japan  in  March  2013  and  immediately 
introduced  a  monetary  policy  regime  --  quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary  easing 
(QQE)  --  that  is  quite  different  from  past  regimes.  QQE  consists  of  two  pillars:  (1) 
 6 
directly working on people's expectations through a price stability target of 2 percent and 
a strong and clear commitment to doing whatever it takes to achieve this, and (2) directly 
encouraging  a  decline  in  long-term  interest  rates  through  large-scale  purchases  of 
long-term Japanese government bonds (JGBs). If inflation expectations rise as a result of 
the former and nominal long-term interest rates fall as a result of the latter, this will push 
real interest rates to levels below the natural rate of interest even in the face of the zero 
lower bound. 
In additional steps, the Bank of Japan in January 2016 introduced a negative interest rate 
policy in order to address the strong headwinds caused by turbulence in global financial 
markets.  The  negative  interest  rate  policy  aims  at  exerting  further  downward  pressure 
on interest rates across the entire yield curve by pushing down the short end of the yield 
curve,  in  combination  with  large-scale  purchases  of  JGBs.  Thereafter,  in  September 
2016, the  Bank  conducted  a  comprehensive  assessment  on  developments  in  economic 
activity and prices as well as policy effects since the introduction of QQE; based on the 
findings,  the  Bank  introduced  yield curve control, which focuses on long-term interest 
rates in addition to short-term interest rates as the operating target. However, the basic 
approach of lowering nominal  interest  rates across the entire  yield curve  and lowering 
real interest rates by raising inflation expectations has remained unchanged. 
In  modern  central  banking,  QQE  is  classified  as  unconventional  monetary  policy,  but 
from a somewhat longer-term perspective, it can be said to be a contemporary application 
of Hawtrey's theory on the importance of guiding expectations and Keynes' theory that 
monetary easing can be conducted through the purchase of long-term government bonds. 
An old East Asian proverb --  "visiting  old,  learn  new"  --  says that one can derive new 
understanding from  learning the lessons of the past,  and  I think this is  particularly apt 
with regard to the intellectual journey leading up to QQE. 
In  practice,  QQE  has  produced  its  intended  effects.  Inflation  expectations  climbed 
notably after the introduction of QQE. This demonstrates that a strong determination by 
the central bank pushes  up  people's forward-looking  inflation expectations. In addition, 
 7 
the large-scale purchases of JGBs as part of QQE have exerted downward pressure on 
nominal interest rates across the entire yield curve. As a result, the Bank  of  Japan  has 
succeeded in reducing real interest rates to levels well below the natural rate of interest 
for the first time in its two-decade long battle with the zero lower bound on the short-term 
policy interest rate (Chart 7). 
These monetary easing effects have stimulated economic activity both in the corporate 
and household sectors, and the output gap has improved substantially. Corporate profits 
are at record highs. The unemployment rate has fallen to less than 3 percent, meaning that 
Japan has almost achieved full employment  (Chart 8). Wages are rising moderately with 
the tightening of labor  market  conditions.  An especially noteworthy change is  that the 
practice  of  regular  increases  in  base  pay,  which  had  disappeared  during  the  prolonged 
deflation since the second half of the 1990s, has returned and has now been observed for 
the fourth consecutive year. A virtuous cycle between rising inflation and wage increases 
has been operating. In other words, Japan is no longer experiencing deflation in the sense 
of a sustained decline in prices. 
 IV. New Challenges under Low Inflation 
It can be said that Japan's experience over the past four years illustrates the effectiveness 
of the kind of  monetary policy approach that  works on expectations first pointed out by 
economists in the first half of the 20th century. That being said, while the policy approach 
has steered Japan's economy in the right direction, our  intellectual  journey  has  not  yet 
been completed. The rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) recently has been 
around 0 percent and there is still  a  long way to  go until the price stability target of 2 
percent is achieved. 
The main reason is that inflation expectations, which had clearly risen as a result of the 
introduction of QQE, have since declined again and have continued to be subdued (Chart 
9). Analysis by the Bank of Japan suggests that, as a result of prolonged deflation, the 
backward-looking,  or  adaptive,  component  in  the  formation  of  inflation  expectations 
 8 
continues to be much stronger in Japan than in Europe and the United States. Therefore, if, 
for whatever reason, the observed inflation rate declines -- even if only temporarily -- this 
will  tend  to  drag  down  inflation  expectations.  With  the  observed  inflation  rate  having 
fallen due to a drop in crude oil prices since autumn 2014 by more than 70 percent and to 
turbulence in global financial markets in 2015 and 2016 reflecting uncertainty regarding 
the prospects of emerging economies, this meant that inflation expectations also declined. 
The Bank of Japan aims to fundamentally dispel the deflationary mindset that has become 
entrenched among the public, but changing people's inflation perceptions is not easy. As 
Hawtrey argued, the problem is psychological. 
In response to this situation, when the Bank of Japan introduced "QQE with Yield Curve 
Control" in September last year, it also introduced an inflation-overshooting commitment 
(Chart 10). Specifically, the Bank  of  Japan committed itself to expanding the monetary 
base until  the  year-on-year rate of increase in  the observed CPI exceeds 2 percent  and 
stays above the target in a stable manner. The idea is that if people actually experience 
inflation above 2 percent, inflation expectations will rise through the adaptive component 
of expectation formation. At the same time, if people experience inflation above 2 percent, 
this  will  boost  the  credibility  of  the  Bank  of  Japan's  price  stability  target  and  the 
formation of inflation expectations will become more forward-looking, helping the Bank 
of Japan to anchor inflation expectations at about 2 percent. 
The problems that Japan's economy has faced since the second half of the 1990s  were 
long regarded as specific to Japan. However, following the global financial crisis, which 
saw the collapse of an asset bubble and severe damage to the financial system, a relatively 
prolonged slowdown in economic growth and a fall in the inflation rate have become an 
experience shared by many economies. As a result of the bold response of central banks 
based on the knowledge and insights gained in the field of economics over the decades, a 
recurrence of the Great Depression was avoided and global concerns over deflation have 
faded to a considerable extent. However, the performance of the global economy today is 
by no means satisfactory. 
 9 
Looking  back,  monetary  policy  to  work  on  expectations  has  played  a  major  role  in 
keeping  inflation  in  check  following  the  bout  of  high  inflation  worldwide  during  the 
1970s. The introduction of inflation targeting in many economies since the 1990s as well 
as  the  remarkable  developments  in  monetary  policy  theory  implicitly  focused  on 
responding to high inflation. While these policies and theoretical developments helped to 
bring about  the  Great Moderation, central banks at the same time started to face a new 
challenge, namely, how to appropriately manage inflation expectations in a low-inflation 
environment under the zero lower bound. 
Central bankers and scholars have only just started to find responses to this new challenge, 
both from a policy and a theoretical perspective. In particular with regard to the inflation 
expectation formation process, which likely differs across countries, regions, and periods, 
more  empirical  analysis  is  needed.  As  a  central  bank,  we  need  to  examine  concrete 
measures  to  appropriately  manage  inflation  expectations  based  on  such  analysis.  The 
inflation-overshooting  commitment  introduced  by  the  Bank  of  Japan  last  year  is  one 
answer, representing a response to the specific situation in Japan, but I strongly hope that 
scholars and policy makers will further deepen the debate from a global perspective. 
British scholars produced sharp insights into the importance of expectations in monetary 
policy nearly a century ago. Nevertheless, the role of expectations continues to provide 
challenges -- both old and new -- today. 
Thank you very much for your attention.

Effects of interest rate policy
“The pressure applied to traders by a moderate rise in the short-
term rate of interest, say, 1 percent, is undeniably very slight. Yet
apparently the Bank of England always counted on a rise of 1
percent or even of 0.5 percent having a noticeable effect.”
“In the first place, when the use of Bank rate to restrict credit
traders, being aware of the
became an established practice,
intentions of the Bank, were inclined to anticipate them. When
Bank rate went up from 3 to 4 percent, a trader would reason that
this was intended to have a restrictive effect on markets, and that,
if the effect was not brought about, the rate would simply go
higher and higher till it was. Those who took that view would
restrict their purchases and demand would fall off, and so the 4
percent rate might be found potent enough, even though,
if
unsupported by traders' anticipations, a 6 or 7 percent rate might
have been necessary.”

Announcement effect of monetary policy
“I want to use the announcement effect of an act of policy to mean
the change which takes place in people's minds, the change in the
prospect which they think to be before them, before there is any
change which expresses itself in transactions of any kind. It is the
same as what Hawtrey calls 'psychological effect'; but that is a
bad term, for it suggests something irrational, and this is entirely
rational.
Expectations of
the future (entirely rational expectations) are
based upon the data that are available in the present. An act of
policy is a significant addition to the data that are available; it
should result, and should almost immediately result, in a shift in
expectations. This is what I mean by an announcement effect.
What I learn from Hawtrey's analysis is that the 'classical' Bank
Rate system was strong, or could be strong, in its announcement
effects.”
