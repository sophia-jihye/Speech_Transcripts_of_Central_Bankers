Germany and Japan 
— A Central Banker's Perspective on their Past and 
Future Relationship 
Speech at the Dinner meeting hosted by Deutsche Bundesbank 
Regional Office in Berlin and Brandenburg   
Hiroshi Nakaso 
Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan 
Introduction 
Vielen Dank für Ihre sehr freundlichen Worte. Es ist mir eine große Freude und Ehre,  hier 
heute  im  schönen  Berlin  und  Brandenburg  vor  Ihnen  sprechen  zu  dürfen!  Ich  würde  mir 
wünschen,  meine  Ansprache  weiter  auf  Deutsch  halten  zu  können.  Um  Ihnen  aber  meine 
Gedanken besser vermitteln zu können, werde ich nun auf Englisch fortfahren. (Thank you 
very much for your kind words. It is my pleasure and honor to speak to you here today in 
the  beautiful  city  of  Berlin  and  Brandenburg.  I  wish  I  could  go  on  with  the  speech  in 
German. But in order to better convey my thoughts to you, I will now continue in English.) 
 I. Relationship between Germany and Japan 
Germany and Japan have a longstanding diplomatic relationship of more than 150 years. I 
think  the  phrase  that  best  describes  this  is  Ferne  Gefährten  (distant  companions).  This  is 
because we have many things in common, although our countries are geographically distant. 
The  diligence  of  our  populations  has  overcome  limitations  of  natural  resources, 
transforming our two countries into economic powers. Today, the labels ''made in Germany'' 
and ''made in Japan'' are a guarantee of quality and excellence. And as mature economies, 
we face similar challenges in the future, with societal aging being one example. 
 The  central  banks  of  Germany  and  Japan  also  developed  a  friendship  over  the  years.  The 
Bank of Japan established an office in Frankfurt am Main in 1956. The Bundesbank opened 
its Tokyo office in 1987, as the only overseas office besides New York. In 2012, the role of 
the  Tokyo  office  was  expanded  to  include  foreign  exchange  reserve  management.  The 
history of our bilateral relationship traces back to the time of the Reichsbank and the Bank 
deutscher Länder. In this context, let me tell you an extraordinary story involving a former 
governor of the Bank of Japan. 
 II. Mr. Mayekawa's Extraordinary Experience 
In the very early part of my career at the Bank of Japan, I worked for Mr. Haruo Mayekawa. 
He was a legendary central banker who served as the 24th Governor of the Bank of Japan, 
from 1979-84. He passed away in 1989 but is still remembered as the man who brought the 
Bank  of  Japan  back  into  the  international  central  banking  community  during  the  post-war 
era. His long international experience, which dated back to the prewar period, won the trust 
of his fellow central bankers. In October 1988, I had a chance to dine with Mr. Mayekawa 
 1 
and his wife at a traditional German restaurant in Berlin. He was invited as a special guest 
to  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  Annual  Meeting  held  here  in  Berlin  that  year. 
Over  a  good  wine,  he  became  a  little  more  eloquent  than  usual  and  started  to  tell  us  the 
following story. 
 Berlin was a special place, he began. The Bank of Japan, after its foundation in 1882, had 
established  several  overseas  offices.  In  1941,  Mr.  Mayekawa  was  assigned  to  the  Bank  of 
Japan's Rome Office. World War II had broken out. After the surrender of Italy, he moved to 
the Bank of Japan's Berlin Office, where he stayed until the final days of the war in Europe. 
He described to us what life was like in the bunkers of Berlin in those days. Then, after the 
fall of Berlin, he fled via the Siberian Railway to Manchuria, a part of China under Japanese 
control at the time. From there he took a ship back to Japan. Had he decided to remain in 
Manchuria,  he  might  have  been  caught  up  in  the  military  offensive  by  the  Soviet  Union 
following  its  declaration  of  war  on  Japan  in  August  1945.  When  Mr.  Mayekawa  finally 
returned home and stood in his doorway, Mrs. Mayekawa told us, she was so surprised that 
she first looked to see whether he had feet  -- because in Japan it is thought that ghosts do 
not  have  feet.  She  had  assumed  he  was  no  longer  alive,  because  he  had  been  reported 
missing. Mr. Mayekawa is probably the only governor in the history of central banking who 
experienced three unconditional surrenders in wartime; in Italy, Germany, and then in Japan. 
At the restaurant, looking at the colorful and prosperous lights of the Kurfürstendamm, he 
concluded his story by telling us how much he cherished peace and how much he thought 
sound economic development mattered. 
 Let me add that for me, too, personally, Germany is a very familiar place. As a young boy in 
the late 1960s, I was brought up in beautiful Hansestadt Hamburg. It was during this period 
that my father took me to West Berlin for the first time. My second visit was in 1988, when, 
as I mentioned, the IMF held an annual meeting in West Berlin and I attended the Japanese 
delegation. So, this is my third visit. But this visit is very special as it is my first one to the 
capital city of the united Germany. 
 III. Origins of Japan's Economic Ordeal 
The two central banks, the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan, have had the reputation as 
tough  inflation  fighters.  However,  the  policy  priority  started  to  diverge  in  the  1990s.  Our 
 2 
mission became focused on ending deflation and bringing Japan's economy back on track to 
sustained  growth.  This  is  the  topic  that  I  now  want  to  talk  about.  Let  me  begin  with  the 
background to the difficulties that Japan has faced. 
 I think the root cause of Japan's economic ordeal is the bursting of asset bubbles in the early 
1990s. Slide 1 looks at the magnitude of the bursting of asset bubbles. As you see in the left 
panel, the cumulative capital gains during the bubble years in Japan amounted to more than 
450 percent of nominal GDP. The bursting of the bubble resulted in a brutally large swing in 
the  opposite  direction,  with  the  cumulative  capital  losses  equivalent  to  almost  minus  230 
percent  of  nominal  GDP.  In  the  United  States,  which  was  the  epicenter  of  the  Global 
Financial  Crisis,  the  corresponding  numbers  were  300  percent  and  minus  100  percent, 
respectively. In both cases, the economic impacts were destructive. 
 In Japan's case, the toll was almost exclusively on the banking sector, which often had been 
compared  to  the  Invincible  Armada  during  the  bubble  era.  Slide  2  shows  the  cumulative 
credit losses experienced by Japanese banks. This figure climbed constantly until it reached 
almost  100  trillion  yen,  which  corresponds  to  about  20  percent  of  Japan's  nominal  GDP. 
During the decade of Japan's financial crisis, more than 180 financial institutions, including 
internationally active ones, went under. The banking sector was broken. This meant the loss 
of the credit intermediary function, which was badly needed at the time to support economic 
recovery.   
 When  Japan's  economy  overcame  the  aftermath  of  the  homegrown  financial  crisis  of  the 
1990s, it was struck by another major shock, triggered by the U.S. subprime loans problem 
and accentuated by the collapse of Lehman Brothers:  the Global Financial Crisis. The left 
panel in Slide 3 shows that the parallel shift of GDP to the downside took place in Japan. 
This  also  was  the  case  for  other  major  economies,  including  the  U.S.  economy.  Although 
the  GDP  recovered  to  pre-crisis  levels,  for  reasons  we  do  not  precisely  know,  it  has  not 
returned  to  the  original  trends  in  the  Japanese  economy  and  many  other  advanced 
economies.  On  the  contrary,  the  German  economy,  which  you  see  in  the  right  panel,  was 
exceptional in that it reverted to the original trend rather quickly with higher growth rates. 
The difference may be an interesting topic to be further explored.   
  3 
Therefore,  the  financial  crisis  was  the  root  cause  for  Japan's  ordeal.  But  the  country's 
problem  was  compounded  by  other  factors;  namely,  deflation  and  demography.  Slide  4 
shows  Japan's  potential  growth  rate  with  a  solid  red  line  and  its  determinants  in  bars  of 
different colors. The protracted period of deflation that lasted for almost 15 years after the 
homegrown  financial  crisis  in  the  1990s  prevented  firms  from  investing  in  capital,  and 
capital input remained sluggish because the corporate strategy under deflation was to sit on 
cash.  Meanwhile,  labor  input  has  negatively  contributed  since  the  1990s  as a  result  of  the 
shift in demographics. This has much to do with Japan's aging society, where the birth rates 
remained low and the baby boomers reached their retirement age.   
 As  the  solid  red line  in  the  graph  shows,  the  potential  growth  rate in Japan  has  been  on  a 
declining trend, coming down from around 4 percent in the late 1980s to almost 0 percent 
before  bouncing  back  to  0.8  percent  recently.  What  this  chart  implies  is  that,  in  order  to 
elevate  Japan's  potential  growth  rate,  we  need  to  raise  all  three  determinants:  total  factor 
productivity (TFP), labor input, and capital input. Another way of expressing this is that we 
need to raise labor productivity and labor input in order to elevate Japan's potential growth 
rate.   
 Slide  5  provides  a  decomposition  of  Japan's  GDP  growth  rates  into  labor  productivity 
growth and rate of change in the number of employed persons. It is quite obvious from the 
chart that the decline in labor force forecast for the next decades must be more than offset 
by  improvement  in  labor  productivity  if  the  Japanese  economy  is  to  maintain  positive 
growth.  What  this  chart  suggests  is  that,  for  a  country  like  Japan,  or  any  country  with  a 
shrinking population, improving labor productivity is the number one policy priority.   
 An interesting question in this regard is how Japan's situation compares with Germany, the 
economy of which is known to face similar demographic challenges sooner or later. Slide 6 
compares  the  economic  performances  of  Japan  and  Germany  over  the  last  decade,  from 
2006 through 2016, and the contributing factors. The average annual economic growth rate 
in Germany was 1.5 percent, which was more than twice as high as Japan's growth rate of 
0.6 percent during the same period. The improvement in labor productivity was more or less 
equivalent  in  both  economies.  The  major  difference  appears  to  be in  terms  of  labor  input. 
While labor input declined in Japan, it has shown positive growth in Germany. 
 4 
 Slide 7 shows why this is the case. While the hours worked by an employed person declined 
in  both  economies,  falls  in  the  unemployment  rate  and  increases  in  the  labor  force 
participation rate have been more pronounced in Germany than in Japan as far as this period 
is concerned. But challenges lie ahead for both economies. The right panel in Slide 8 shows 
that Japan has already turned into what is called a  "population onus society," in which the 
working age population declined at a faster pace than the total population. As the left panel 
suggests, this is forecast to be followed by Germany, albeit in a less conspicuous manner, in 
the coming decades.   
 The  decline  in  the  working  age  population  may  be  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  the 
number  of  foreign  workers.  This  seems  to  typically  have  been  the  case  with  Germany, 
which you see in the panel of Slide 9. Even for Japan, the number of foreign workers has 
climbed  in  recent  years  by  more  than  one  million  against  the  backdrop  of  an  acute  labor 
shortage.     
 Even if a decline in the working age population is inevitable, the negative impact on labor 
input  can  be  mitigated  by  raising  labor  participation  rates.  In  this  regard,  Japan  has  made 
tangible achievements in recent years. Slide 10 offers an international comparison of labor 
force  participation  rates.  The  lower  left  panel  shows  Japan's  labor  participation  rate  for 
women by age group over the past two decades. You see that more women in the age group 
of  25-34  years  (typically  young  working  mothers)  work  today  than  ever  before,  offsetting 
the overall decline in the working age population. The labor participation rate for this age 
group  has  climbed  to  77  percent  in  2016,  and  as  a  result,  the  notorious  M-shaped  curve 
largely  has  been  corrected.  An  international  comparison  shown  in  the  lower  right  panel 
reveals  that Japan's  participation  rates  for  women  in  2016 are  generally  higher  than in the 
United States, although not as high as in Germany or Sweden. 
 Thus,  of  the two  supply-side  determinants  of  economic  growth,  labor  input can  be  upheld 
by  raising  labor  participation  rates.  What  about  the  other  determinant,  labor  productivity? 
Slide  11  provides  us  with  some  insight.  The  left  panel  compares  the  level  of  labor 
productivity in the G7 countries. If you place the U.S. productivity level as the benchmark 
at  100,  Japan's  productivity  level  is  around  70  percent  of  the  U.S.  level.  The  German 
 5 
productivity  level  stands  highest  in  the  G7  economies.  Thus,  for  Japan  to  catch  up  to  the 
U.S. productivity level, it has to close a gap that amounts to 30 percent. As a matter of fact, 
the  right  panel  shows  that  Japan  achieved  one  of  the  highest  productivity  growth  rates 
among the G7 countries between 2000 and 2015. This suggests that there does remain room 
to catch up, and it is actually catching up. We know that our manufacturing companies are 
competitive  on  a  global  standard.  So,  it  is  mainly  the  services  industries  that  need  to 
accelerate  their  catch-up  process,  possibly  through  a  wider  use  of  information  and 
communication technologies. 
 IV. Bank of Japan's Monetary Policy 
Now let me talk about the monetary policy. The Bank of Japan did not just sit by and watch 
Japan's  economic  difficulties.  In  fact,  as  the  nation's  central  bank,  we  went  through  an 
all-out  struggle.  Slide  12  shows  that  the  problem  with  Japan  was  that  the  policy  rate  had 
reached 0 percent in the early 2000s long before other central banks in the major economies 
faced the same problem. This meant that there was no room for the Bank of Japan to reduce 
the  short-term  policy  rate.  Japan  was  faced  with  the  zero-lower  bound  ahead  of  other 
industrialized economies.   
 When  room  for  further  policy  rate  cuts  was  exhausted,  we  introduced  a  number  of  new 
monetary  policy  measures  that  are  described  today  as  unconventional  monetary  policies. 
The  Bank  of  Japan  originated  quantitative  easing  and  was  the  first  to  employ  forward 
guidance.  We  have  literally  been  an  inventor  of  various  sorts  of  new  forms  of  monetary 
policies. The latest version of such new policies is called Yield Curve Control (YCC). Slide 
13 shows the outline of the policy. It intends to facilitate the formation and thus the shape of 
a  yield  curve  that  is  considered  most  appropriate  for  maintaining  the  momentum  toward 
achieving the price stability target of 2 percent.   
 Under YCC, the operational target is the interest rate. The novelty is that we have two target 
rates. The short-term policy interest rate is set at minus 0.1 percent and the target level of 
the 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields at around 0 percent. We are buying a 
necessary and sufficient quantity of JGBs to maintain the rate targets. I think the policy has 
been  quite  effective.  The  left  panel  in  Slide  14  shows  that  Japan's  yield  curve  generally 
stays  lower  than  those  in the  United  States  and  Germany.  A  comparison  with  the  German 
 6 
yield curve reveals that, while shorter rates are lower in Germany, long-term rates are kept 
lower in Japan than in Germany. The right panel compares 10-year bond yields in the major 
economies.  While  the  U.S.  Treasury  rates  moved  up  after  the  presidential  election  in 
November  2016,  dragging  the  German  Bunds  rates  in  the  same  direction,  the  JGB  yields 
remained at lower levels under YCC. 
 I  now  turn  to  economic  and  inflation  development  in  Japan  to  show  that  the  monetary 
policy has worked quite effectively. Slide 15 provides the Bank of Japan's latest economic 
and  inflation  outlook.  As  you  see  in  the  table,  Japan's  economy  is  forecast  to  grow  1.9 
percent  in  fiscal  2017  and  1.4  percent  in  fiscal  2018.  This  is  well  above  Japan's  potential 
growth  rate,  which  is  estimated  to  be  around  0.8  percent.  Therefore,  the  output  gap  is 
expected  to  improve  further  into  positive  territory.  This  is  supposed  to  exert  upward 
pressure  on  prices.  However,  on  the  inflation  front,  consumer  price  index  (CPI)  inflation 
rates  remain  weak  and  are  only  expected  to  reach  1.8  percent  in  fiscal  2019,  still  falling 
short of the price stability target of 2 percent.     
 In the meantime, the economy has never been better balanced in the recent past. As we see 
in the left panel of Slide 16, corporate profits have climbed to record high levels. The labor 
market  is  very  tight  with  the  unemployment  rate,  shown  in  the  middle  panel,  all  the  way 
down  to  2.7  percent,  which  implies  full  employment.  Meanwhile,  job  opening  rates,  as 
shown in the right panel, rose to historically high levels. So, the question is why the prices 
are  so  weak  when the  macroeconomic  fundamentals  are  so  favorable.  As  a matter  of  fact, 
this may be a common question to be asked of the economies of the United  States and the 
Euro area. 
 My  answer  to  the  question  in  Japan  is  that,  against  the  backdrop  of  acute  labor  shortage, 
corporate firms in Japan are trying to absorb wage cost pressures without passing them on 
to sales prices, through such measures as labor-saving capital expenditure, and streamlining 
their  business  processes,  by  doing  away  with  excessive  or  unnecessary  services.  In  both 
cases, labor productivity improves and exerts downward pressure on inflation. As a matter 
of  fact, as  you see in the left panel of Slide 17, a macroeconomic perspective tells us that 
labor productivity is on a steady upward trend recently, while real wages are moving almost 
sideways. Thus, the gap between them, which we label the real wage gap, has declined, as 
 7 
you  see  in  the  right  panel.  This  means  that  real  wage  increases  have  not  caught  up  with 
improvements in labor productivity.   
 In  sum,  I  think  weak  inflation  in  Japan  has  to  do  with  higher  productivity,  which  can  be 
regarded  as  a  supply-side  shock.  Assuming  that  wages  eventually  catch  up  with  labor 
productivity  improvement  and  the  wage  gap  reverts  to  zero  over  time,  we  can  expect 
inflation rates to pick up accordingly. I think it is a matter of time before we start to witness 
inflationary pressures gather momentum. To the extent that good things are happening to the 
economy, I think we do not need to be overly frustrated about the low inflation. We can be 
patient and continue with the current monetary policy without any further easing. 
 V. Lessons from the Japanese Experience 
What lessons, if any, does the Japanese experience have for the Euro area, which now faces 
similar challenges ranging from low inflation to demographics? I wish I could offer  you a 
full  answer,  but  our  own  mission  to  overcome  deflation  and  bring  the  economy  back  on 
track  toward  sustained  growth  is  not  fully  completed.  So,  what  I'll  offer  here  are  three 
interim suggestions.   
 First, you definitely need to avoid a financial crisis. We have learned that a financial crisis 
inflicts lasting damage on the economy. Therefore, it is essential that the soundness of the 
financial  system  is  maintained  through  adequate  regulation  and  supervision.  It  is  just  as 
important  to  have  an  operational  safety  net,  including  a  deposit  insurance  system  and 
resolution framework that prevents a failure of a financial institution from developing into a 
systemic crisis. In this regard, the completion of the Basel III regulatory reforms that began 
following the onset of the global financial crisis is a significant achievement.   
 Second,  monetary  policy  alone  cannot  achieve  the  ultimate  goal  of  overcoming  deflation 
and  bringing  the  economy  back  on  track  to  sustained  growth.  Monetary  policy  must  be 
pursued in tandem with the growth strategy, or structural policies more broadly. Monetary 
easing raises potential GDP through an increase in the capital stock as well as labor input, 
thus  affecting  the  supply  side.  Moreover,  accommodative  monetary  conditions  should 
mitigate  any  frictional  costs  that  might  otherwise  accompany  the  necessary  structural 
reforms. What we in Japan and the Euro area have in our hands is a golden opportunity to 
 8 
upgrade our economies. We should not miss this chance to promote much needed structural 
reforms. 
 Third, the central bank needs to maintain its credentials as a deflation fighter as much as an 
inflation fighter by showing a clear and unequivocal commitment to battle deflation. Should 
this  be  lost,  our  experience  suggests  that  the  credentials  would  be  extremely  difficult  to 
recover.   
 I  am  sure  that  the  policy  makers  in  the  Euro  area,  including  the  Bundesbank,  recognize 
precisely these points and therefore require no advice from me. The cumulative wisdom we 
have  built  up  over  the  years  in  addressing  the  challenges  should  collectively  and  fully  be 
utilized in guiding our economies in the right direction. 
  Closing Remarks 
One  summer  day  in  the  late  1960s,  when  I  lived  in  Hamburg,  my  father  drove  me  to  the 
border of what was then the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR). At the border in the 
middle of a meadow, a Bundeswehr border guard approached me and said  ''Look boy, also 
beyond  here  is  Germany—auch  drüben  ist  Deutschland.''  What  Germany  has  achieved 
since  then  is  a  truly  admirable  Wirtschaftswunder  (economic  wonder).  I  understand  it  has 
embarked on the ''Industrie 4.0'' initiative to create yet another Wirtschaftswunder.   
 In the five decades since my boyhood in Germany, the social and economic environments in 
both  countries  have  changed  quite  dramatically.  Today,  an  average  Japanese  person  has  a 
life expectancy that is 15 years longer than people did in 1960. An average Japanese worker 
today  works  50  hours  less  per  month  compared  with  1960.  Similarly,  in  Germany,  life 
expectancy  today  is  13  years  longer  and  a  German  worker  works  70  hours  less  compared 
with 1960. This is a big change for the people in the two countries, whose common virtue 
used to be diligence in the 1960s. But this is not necessary a bad thing, because people have 
more  time  to  enjoy  life.  It  also  means  that  we  have  more  time  to  get  to  know  each  other 
even better.   
  9 
I  have  a  father,  who  is  now  fully  retired  and  is  one  of  those  enjoying  longer  life.  When  I 
visited  him  over  the  New  Year  holiday,  he  told  me  he  still  regularly  exchanges  updated 
family  history  with  his  alten  Kameraden  (old  comrades)  fifty  years  on  since  his  days  in 
Germany. Old friendship never dies. I now know it is the responsibility of our generation to 
not just inherit the friendship with Germany, but foster it and pass it on to the generations to 
come.   
 Thanks  to  technological  innovation,  we  can  learn  a  lot  more  easily  about  each  other's 
history and culture these days. In addition, traveling has become far easier, enabling ''seeing 
is believing'' for many people. Thus, I believe the relationship between Germany and Japan 
is  entering  a  new  stage  beyond  the  traditional  sphere,  where  economic  and  cultural 
interaction has become an everyday affair, making geographical distance less meaningful. I 
would  like  to  conclude  my  speech  this  evening  by  expressing  my  sincere  hope  that  our 
friendship develops from Ferne Gefährten (distant companions) to what can be called Enge 
Gefährten (close companions). This concludes my speech this evening.   
 Ich danke Ihnen für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit. (I thank you for your attention.)

The data used to compute labor productivity except for the GDP deflator series are based on the “Financial Statements Statistics of Corporations 
by Industry, Quarterly,” and do not cover the finance and insurance industry.
3. The real wage gap is defined as the deviation of real wages from labor productivity.
4. Shaded areas indicate recession periods.
5. Data for real wages and labor productivity are seasonally adjusted.
