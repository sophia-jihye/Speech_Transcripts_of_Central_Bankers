Data, correlations and economic policy 
challenges∗ 
At the beginning of the Riksbank’s monetary policy reports, there is a page 
describing the monetary policy strategy. The basis of the strategy is that the 
Riksbank shall strive towards an annual change of 2 per cent in the consumer 
price index with a fixed interest rate (CPIF). Given that there is confidence in the 
inflation target, monetary policy shall also support good growth in output and 
employment. The Riksbank therefore conducts what is generally referred to as 
flexible inflation targeting.  
This is the basic framework for monetary policy. Within this framework, the 
Riksbank must cope with the fact that the economy and the way it works change 
over time. My intention here today is to discuss some of the challenges facing 
monetary policy and economic policy in general as a result of changes that have 
occurred over the last decade. In brief, it is a question of surprisingly subdued 
wage increases, the apparent difficulty in reducing unemployment further via 
expansionary policy alone, and the apparent deterioration in matching on the 
labour market. 
I intend to discuss this with the help of a simple survey, in which I look at how five 
key variables covary. The time period I’m studying is 2007–2018 and I’m using 
monthly data. The five key variables are:  
inflation, measured as the CPIF, the target variable for monetary policy 
• 
•  wage increases, according to short-term wage statistics from the National 
Institute of Economic Research (NIER) 
•  unemployment, according to the Labour Force Surveys (LFS) 
• 
job openings, according to statistics from the Swedish Public Employment 
Service (Arbetsförmedlingen) on remaining job openings 
                                                           
∗ I would especially like to thank Mikael Apel and Emelie Theobald for their help with this speech. Meredith 
Beechey, Charlotta Edler, Jesper Hansson, Ann-Leena Mikiver, Åsa Olli Segendorf, Cecilia Roos-Isaksson and Ulf 
Söderström have all submitted valuable comments.

    the krona exchange rate, according to the trade-weighted KIX index. 
In order to focus on the trends in these five variables, I remove seasonal 
variations and general noise in the series by using moving averages over twelve 
months throughout. We will follow the time series for these variables two at a 
time. By doing so, we can see the covariation between inflation and 
unemployment, for example.  
Looking at data is a good place to start 
It is important to understand that covariation between two variables does not 
necessarily mean that there is a causal relationship, a causality, between them. 
Instead, the covariation may, for example, depend on a third variable that is not 
shown. A classic example is the strong correlation between sleeping with your 
shoes on and waking up with a headache. But this presumably does not imply that 
the shoes cause the headache. There is instead an underlying variable explaining 
why a person both sleeps with their shoes on and wakes up with a headache. 
We should also be aware that when plotting two variables against each other, it is 
very rare to expect to find a clear-cut correlation of the type we see in textbook 
illustrations. The reason is, of course, that the variables are not just linked to each 
other but are also constantly influenced by a number of other factors. For 
example, inflation can be affected by changes in energy prices that do not have 
any significant impact on unemployment. Unemployment can, in turn, be affected 
by reforms on the labour market, for example, which do not have any significant 
effect on inflation, at least not immediately. In other words, we cannot expect to 
see an exact relationship but often have to be content with just barely being able 
to detect one.  
On the other hand, the absence of a correlation that is visible to the eye does not 
mean that there isn’t one. It may still be there and be detectable only if we 
control for variables other than just the two we are studying. 
To gain a better understanding of what happens behind the scenes, therefore, we 
often have to delve deeper into the data, consider more variables and use more 
sophisticated analytical methods than “eyeball econometrics”. But studying 
exactly what the data looks like is always a good starting-point. 
So let’s now look at the figures! 
The Phillips curve – central but controversial 
Allow me to begin with the correlation that is normally called “the Phillips curve”. 
The name comes from the New Zealand economist, William Phillips, who, in an 
article in 1958, showed that there was a negative correlation between 
unemployment and wage increases in British data for the period 1861–1957. High 
unemployment tended therefore to be associated with low wage increases and 
vice versa, as in Figure 1. When many people compete for jobs, demand for higher 
wage increases falls while a shortage of labour leads to greater wage increases.

 Unemployment
 Subsequently, the Phillips curve concept was broadened to accommodate slightly 
different, though similar, correlations. In 1960, two American economists, Paul 
Samuelson and Robert Solow, both awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences in 
Memory of Alfred Nobel, reformulated the curve in terms of unemployment and 
inflation rather than unemployment and wage increases. As there is a close 
relationship between unemployment and output, the Phillips curve was also often 
formulated in terms of the correlation between inflation and output – or, as it is 
commonly expressed nowadays, resource utilisation. But it is basically the same 
thing we want to identify, namely a correlation between economic activity and 
the rate of increase in prices and wages. 
For a time, the Phillips curve was interpreted as economic policy-makers being 
able to choose a combination of inflation and unemployment. This was thought to 
be possible if the aim was a more permanent reduction in unemployment and 
there was a willingness to accept higher inflation in return.  
But about ten years after the launch of the Phillips curve, Milton Friedman and 
Edmund Phelps, Nobel laureates in economics themselves, each lay the 
foundations for the so-called “expectations-augmented Phillips curve”. In brief, 
this implies that there is a short-term negative correlation between inflation and 
unemployment, but no long-term relationship. In other words, it is not possible to 
choose a certain combination of inflation and unemployment and then expect it 
to last. The reasoning behind this can be illustrated using Figure 2.

Unemployment
 The short-term correlation basically depends on the fact that higher inflation is 
often unexpected inflation. An expansionary policy can lead to lower 
unemployment and higher inflation; we move from A to B. But gradually, agents 
in the economy realise that inflation has risen and demand higher wage increases 
as compensation. In other words, the higher inflation is incorporated in the 
expectations and becomes the norm, and the higher wage increases cause 
unemployment to rise. The short-term correlation shifts upwards and we move 
from B to C. We are then back to the same unemployment as when we started, 
but with higher inflation. If the same thing were to be repeated, we would move 
in a similar way from C to D to E. Once again, unemployment is the same but 
inflation is higher. This unemployment is normally referred to as “equilibrium 
unemployment”.  
A consequence is thus that an expansionary monetary policy cannot permanently 
create high employment and low unemployment. The long-run Phillips curve is 
therefore assumed to be vertical, as shown in the figure.  
It’s good to keep this in mind, but I won’t discuss the long-run Phillips curve any 
more here. Instead, I will concentrate on the short-run Phillips curve, as it is an 
important piece of the puzzle for economic policy-makers, not least central banks. 
It is the link between demand in the economy, which central banks are assumed 
to be able to influence with their policy rates, and inflation.  
Negatively sloped Phillips curve with inflation – but flat 
with wage increases 
So what does the correlation look like in Swedish data? As I mentioned in my 
introduction, I will look at data for the last decade. To make the figures clearer, I 
have marked the period 2007–2010 in blue and the period from 2011 in red.

As we see in Figure 3, there is a reasonably clear negative correlation during the 
whole period. The following additional observations can be made if we look a little 
closer: 
(i) 
(ii) 
During the period 2015–2017, inflation rose while unemployment fell.  
Over the last six months, unemployment has fallen while inflation has 
remained on a level consistent with the inflation target. 
For a given level of unemployment, inflation has tended to be lower in 
recent years than it was during the period 2007–2010. 
(iii) 
As I noted, the original Phillips curve was formulated in terms of wage growth and 
not inflation. So what does such a curve look like for Sweden over the last 
decade? 
Seen over the entire period, the correlation also seems to be negative in Figure 4. 
But if we look at developments since 2011 in particular, there does not appear to 
be a correlation – The Phillips correlation seems to be more or less horizontal. 
Despite good economic developments especially in recent years, and many 
believe we are in the midst of an economic boom, wage growth has not increased. 
Why is this?

First of all, we should remember here that we are, after all, talking about a rather 
short period of time. In other words, it is still slightly too early to draw the 
conclusion that some form of structural change has taken place on the labour 
market that will affect developments in the future. But obviously, it is 
nevertheless interesting to reflect on the causes of the development. 
It is also worth pointing out the fact that the unusually low wage growth, given 
the activity in the economy, is not a specifically Swedish phenomenon. The 
situation is much the same in most other industrialised countries and the 
underlying reasons are currently the subject of rather intensive discussion.1   
A more flexible labour supply a possible explanation  
In my view, an important overarching explanation is that the labour supply has 
probably become more flexible and elastic than previously. In other words, the 
supply curve on the labour market is flatter. This implies that greater resource 
utilisation does not necessarily lead to higher wage increases. When demand in 
the economy rises, it can be satisfied by labour being drafted into the production 
process, without much of a pressure to increase wages.   
As I see it, there are primarily three probable causes behind the more flexible and 
elastic labour supply. The first is globalisation and increasing economic 
integration. Globalisation, and hence rising trade, increases labour supply in an 
indirect way. By this, I mean that products previously manufactured inside the 
                                                           
1 See for instance Leduc and Wilson (2017). 
  6 [16] 
   country by domestic labour can now often be manufactured abroad, often more 
cheaply, and then be imported. This implies that global labour supply affects 
domestic wage increases, especially regarding the less educated workforce.  
Economic integration within the EU affects labour supply in a direct way as a 
result of the free movement of labour within the Union. Many utilise the 
opportunities provided by free movement – some by moving permanently, others 
by working temporarily in other countries within the Union. 
The other cause is technological development. The electronic revolution has made 
it possible to organise work in a different way than previously. For example, it has 
made teleworking much more possible. This occurs not only inside Sweden but 
also in the form of teleworking from other countries in organisations that are 
located in Sweden. Teleworking makes it possible to use the labour force more 
flexibly over the business cycle, so that the work can be part-time when economic 
activity is low and full-time when activity is high.  
The third cause has to do with changes of institutions in a broad sense. A concrete 
Swedish example is that more and more collective agreements contain 
agreements on working time “banks”. According to these agreements, the 
number of hours worked for an employee can be redistributed over the business 
cycle. Another example is the emergence of temporary employment agencies in 
Sweden. From once upon a time being illegal, the industry is currently about 
80,000 strong. In 2017, 250,000 were employed by the temporary employment 
industry in the areas of temporary staffing, career transition and direct 
recruitment.  
In Sweden, we have also seen greater labour supply among older people. 
According to the LFS for the first quarter of 2018, almost four per cent of those 
employed were between 65 and 74 years old. One can assume that their labour 
supply is very flexible. If we add all these explanations together, it is perhaps not 
so strange that the correlation between resource utilisation and nominal wage 
increases seems to have weakened in recent years. 
Other explanations also feasible  
But there are also other feasible explanations for the observation in Figure 4. One 
is that what is normally referred to as “structural unemployment”, the 
unemployment level in a situation with normal activity in the economy, has 
fallen.2 An overestimation of structural unemployment implies that there is more 
spare capacity in the economy than originally thought and it is thereby possible to 
stimulate demand more before wage growth kicks in.  
The fact that structural unemployment cannot be observed and also varies over 
time obviously makes it difficult to verify the hypothesis. Purely theoretically, the 
observation that wage increases are unexpectedly low is well in line with an 
overestimation of structural unemployment.  Personally, I am a little sceptical 
                                                           
2 For example, Bell and Blanchflower (2018) think this is the case in the United Kingdom. 
  7 [16] 
   about this hypothesis as far as Sweden is concerned. I will come back to this later 
on.  
Another possible explanation for the low wage increases has to do with how 
inflation has developed after the financial crisis. For about six years, between 
2011 and 2017, CPIF inflation was below and often well below target. It would not 
be particularly surprising if this has had a certain impact on what economic agents 
generally believe about inflation.  
It is true that inflation expectations, as they are measured in surveys, indicate that 
economic agents are now once again expecting inflation to remain on target in 
the long term.  It also appears that employee organisations are increasingly seeing 
the inflation target as the basis for wage negotiations. At the same time, however, 
employers are claiming that the inflation target is no longer an obvious starting-
point. According to the Swedish Association of Industrial Employers, it is instead 
competitiveness and wage outcomes in the euro area that constitute their 
benchmark.3 The implications of this are not obvious. Ultimately, the outcome 
depends on each respective party’s negotiating strength. 
But since wage increases in Germany, for example, have tended to be quite 
modest and since the industrial sector’s wage agreements in turn constitute a 
benchmark for other collective agreements in Sweden, it is conceivable that this 
could have contributed to the flat Phillips curve since 2011 in Figure 4. In the long 
term, however, this should not be a major problem as the euro area has an 
inflation target of “close to 2 per cent”, i.e. very close to our own target.  This 
should imply that wage increases will also be higher in the euro area going 
forward.  But tensions may arise periodically, of course. 
All in all, therefore, there are numerous feasible explanations for why wage 
increases have been relatively low despite good economic development. But so 
far we have no definitive answer to why it is like this nor to how permanent the 
phenomenon is.  
Research on the Phillips curve ongoing  
As I mentioned, the discussion about the Phillips curve is international to a high 
degree. Quite lively debate has been taking place in various countries recently 
centred on intensive estimation of Phillips curves, using slightly different 
specifications and different methods.4 This is what I mean when I say that we 
need more advanced methods than studying pairwise plots, in order to try to 
come to grips with what the correlation actual looks like.  
In this context, it can be interesting to mention that a few fresh contributions to 
the debate originate from the School of Business here at Örebro University, where 
Sune Karlsson and Pär Österholm have estimated Phillips curves for the US and 
Sweden respectively in terms of inflation and unemployment. For Sweden during 
the period 1995–2017, the Phillips curve has, perhaps not so surprisingly, been 
found not to have been stable over time. It is also found that the Phillips curve, 
                                                           
3 See, for example, Kinnwall and Rune (2018). 
4 See for example Blanchard (2016), Cunliffe (2017) and Murphy (2018). 
  8 [16] 
   specified in this way, has not become flatter in recent years. The Phillips curve has 
also been found to have been unstable for the US. It appears to have been flatter 
in 2005–2013 but thereafter to have had a clearer negative slope.  
It should be understood that economic research helps to improve our knowledge 
in that findings from many different quarters are thrashed out and hopefully 
eventually all point in a particular direction. Findings have so far varied a great 
deal. Off and on, the Phillips curve has been said to be dead, still alive but flatter 
than before or about the same as usual. My interpretation is that “the jury is still 
out” but that the most common finding in the studies performed seems to be that 
the correlation between the economic situation and inflation or wage increases 
has weakened, but is still there. 
Correlation between job openings and wage 
increases 
The number of people unemployed is a measure indicating an unsatisfied labour 
supply, i.e. the number of people who would like to have a job but have yet to 
obtain one. The unsatisfied labour demand, i.e. job openings that remain unfilled, 
can also be measured in a similar way.  The unsatisfied labour demand, or labour 
shortage as it is normally referred to, is normally measured in terms of job 
vacancies.  
In the statistics, the discrepancy is made between job vacancies and job openings. 
The fact that an employer has a job opening means that the employer has started 
the external recruitment of an employee but has yet to employ someone. This is a 
wider concept than vacancy, which is defined as a “vacant, unstaffed job that can 
be taken up immediately”. The difference is that a job opening can be staffed, for 
example by a supply worker performing the work temporarily. But it can also be 
unstaffed without it necessarily being possible for someone to fill it immediately. 
One reason can be that the employer has planned well in advance and starts 
recruitment in good time before the needs become acute. 
As I noted in my introduction, the fact that I am pointing out these rather subtle 
and technical discrepancies is only because I have chosen to highlight various 
correlations over the past decade by using monthly data. In Swedish statistics, 
there are monthly data on job openings, while job vacancies are only reported 
quarterly. Even though it would be desirable in many ways to use vacancies, I 
therefore have to use job openings as an approximation. If we look at the data, it 
does not make much difference in this context, but it can still be good to know 
that I am simplifying a little here as job openings and job vacancies are not really 
the same thing. 
If we now view job openings as a measure of labour demand, we could see the 
relationship between job openings and wage increases as a kind of inverse Phillips 
curve. In the same way as the relationship between wage increases and 
unemployment can be expected to be negative, the correlation between wage 
increases and job openings should be positive.

Figure 5 indicates that this is not really the case during this period. Seen over the 
entire period, the correlation, if anything, is negative. If we look again at 
developments since 2011, the curve is almost horizontal, once again reflecting 
that wage increases have been low and stable. 
We have now looked at the correlations between wage increases and 
unemployment and between wage increases and the number of job openings. Let 
us complete the cycle and also study the third possible combination, that is, the 
correlation between the number of job openings and unemployment. 
 The Beveridge curve shows how well the 
labour market is functioning   
The correlation between job openings, or job vacancies to be exact, and 
unemployment is another well-known curve within economics. It is called the 
Beveridge curve and like the Phillips curve was developed in 1958. In contrast to 
the Phillips curve, however, William Beveridge was not the originator of the curve, 
but a British economist who gave his name to the curve as a result of his 
commitment to labour issues such as unemployment and skills matching. 
The Beveridge curve is a way of measuring how well the labour market is 
functioning. It is reasonable to assume that when demand in the economy is high, 
the number of job openings rises while unemployment falls, and vice versa. The 
correlation should therefore be negative. But it is above all the position on the 
Beveridge curve that is interesting. If there is a large number of job openings at 
the same time as unemployment is high, it suggest that those who are 
  10 [16] 
   unemployed cannot for some reason fill the openings. In other words, there are 
problems matching job-seekers to the job openings on the labour market, i.e. the 
labour market is not functioning particularly well. 
What then does the Beveridge curve look like in Swedish data over the last 
decade? 
As we see in Figure 6, the correlation is negative, exactly as expected. But we also 
see that the correlation from 2011 is higher than previously, i.e. for each given 
level of unemployment, there is a greater number of job openings. In other 
words, it seems as though matching on the Swedish labour market is now worse 
than it was before.

What overall conclusions can we therefore draw from these simple correlations I 
have presented? Well, if we look merely at the data, lower unemployment has not 
led to higher wage increases. It has, on the other hand, been associated with a 
rise in the number of job openings. It is not altogether easy to interpret this 
development. One interpretation could, however, be that companies after the 
financial crisis have, to a greater extent, been looking to recruit workers with 
different types of cutting-edge expertise. This is unfortunately a type of labour 
that is often difficult to find. This is also the impression I get when I have travelled 
around the country and talked to different companies. If higher wages are 
offered, it is for this type of labour, but this nevertheless does not appear to have 
prevented a shortage of labour from emerging in this segment of the labour 
market.  
  11 [16] 
   On the increasingly dominant “traditional” labour market, however, labour 
shortage does not seem to have been such a major problem. There, a flexible 
labour supply has helped to restrain wage increases, in the way I described earlier. 
Why has inflation risen? 
The Phillips correlation measured in terms of inflation has been negatively sloped 
since 2011, while in terms of wage increases, it has been completely flat. How 
then has inflation risen despite wage increases not having done so?  
Inflation rose steadily between 2014 and 2017, measured in terms of the CPIF, 
from around 0.5 per cent to a level consistent with the inflation target of 2 per 
cent. It is of course difficult to identify the exact impact of individual factors on 
inflation, but it is nevertheless possible to highlight some things that have played 
a part. One factor that affects the CPIF in rather a direct and straightforward way 
is changes in the international market prices for energy. Particularly in 2017, 
higher energy prices helped fuel CPIF inflation. Earlier in the period, the 
contribution from energy prices was instead negative.  
Another factor, which is more difficult to capture and had an inhibitory effect for 
a long time, is international economic activity. In Sweden, resource utilisation has 
been rising for quite a long time, which should have made it easier for companies 
to raise their prices. At the same time, however, a weak and uncertain economic 
situation abroad has contributed to lower external price pressures. Recently, 
however, increasingly strong international economic activity has pushed inflation 
upwards in many countries. More inflation impulses from abroad should also have 
further improved the conditions for an inflation rate in line with the target. 
A factor that has probably also contributed to higher inflation is the rise in both 
short- and long-term inflation expectations, as they are measured in surveys, 
since 2015. Since the end of 2016, more long-term inflation expectations have 
been close to the inflation target of 2 per cent. Actual inflation obviously affects 
expectations, but the converse is also true. When confidence in the inflation 
target is strong, it becomes easier to reach the target, as price and wage 
formation are adapted to these expectations. 
The development of the exchange rate has also contributed to the upturn in 
inflation. In a simple theoretical framework, the change in price level, i.e. 
inflation, is affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate.5 But such a correlation is 
difficult to find. If we compare exchange rate fluctuations and inflation during the 
same period, the correlation is zero. However, the exchange rate influences 
inflation with a time lag. The correlation between inflation and exchange rate 
fluctuations twelve months previously is 0.19 in my data material. If we lag the 
exchange rate fluctuations a further twelve months, the correlation increases to 
0.43. The maximum correlation (0.46) occurs when the time lag is 27 months. It 
now becomes clear that there is a positive correlation between exchange rate 
                                                           
5 In models where prices are rigid, the inflation rate is instead affected by the level of the exchange rate, or by 
the real exchange rate’s deviation from its long-term value. 
  12 [16] 
    fluctuations and inflation, see Figure 7. When the krona weakens, i.e. when the 
KIX-index increases, inflation also rises.

Of course, the correlation between the exchange rate and inflation is neither 
clear-cut nor straightforward. It depends, for example, on what has caused the 
exchange rate to fluctuate and how long it is expected to last.6 But the fact that 
there is a correlation, insofar as a weakening of the exchange rate tends to result 
in rising inflation and vice versa, is obvious. 
Finally, it should be emphasised that monetary policy has of course been 
important in this development. From the ongoing debate, the impression can 
sometimes be that monetary policy does not play such a major role and that 
economic activity had been just as strong and inflation had been on target 
regardless of the policy conducted by the Riksbank. This is of course not the case.  
No causal relationship between wages and 
prices 
What then does the fact that inflation has risen but not wages actually signify? To 
begin with, and for the sake of completeness, we can also plot inflation against 
wage increases (see Figure 8). As we see, there is a tendency towards a positive 
correlation, at least periodically.

But what about the causal relationships? There sometimes appears to be a 
tendency to see wage increases as the source of all inflation. The perceived chain 
of events is that an increase in inflation is always preceded by a tighter labour 
market pushing up wage increases and companies then passing on the increased 
costs in the form of higher prices. Can we therefore expect modest wage 
increases to push down inflation going forward?  
No, such an unshakeable causal relationship between wage increases and 
inflation does not exist. It can just as easily be the case that stronger demand can 
allow companies to increase their prices. This increases their profits and margins, 
which in turn provides scope for them to raise wages. The interplay between 
prices, wages and activity in the economy – and of course a number of other 
variables, not least productivity – is complex.  
There are quite a few studies that have examined the links between wage 
increases and future inflation and whether wage increases tend to precede or lag 
behind inflation. Not unexpectedly, the findings vary somewhat, but a fairly 
common finding seems to be that wage increases are not particularly informative 
when it comes to forecasting inflation.7 The fact that wage increases have been 
modest for a while need not therefore signify that inflation will fall in the period 
ahead. Personally, I believe that both inflation and long-term inflation 
expectations will remain close to 2 per cent going forward, even if monetary 
policy is made slightly less expansionary.

   With inflation on target – new challenges 
So allow me to summarise. I think this survey presents three important economic 
policy challenges. An important starting-point is that inflation is on target. It has 
now been around the target of 2 per cent in outcomes and expectations for some 
time. Target attainment is good. Occasional monthly variations by the odd tenth 
of a percentage point around the 2 per cent mark must not determine monetary 
policy, as I see it. And given that inflation is on target, there is scope for 
considering other important macroeconomic variables.  
The first challenge is that for several years there has been no correlation between 
unemployment and vacancies on the one hand and wage increases on the other. 
Unemployment has fallen but wage increases have remained steady at around 2 
per cent as an annual rate. Inflation has indeed climbed back to target without 
any help from wage increases, which shows that inflation does not necessarily 
have to be wage-driven. But there is still reason to ask oneself how permanent 
the subdued wage increases are. 
The second challenge has to do with unemployment. The key question is: Has 
unemployment bottomed out? Or can it fall further with an expansionary 
monetary policy? My assessment is that it will not be possible to bring 
unemployment down much further with monetary policy alone. In my view, the 
increasing demand for labour that we are currently witnessing is more likely to 
lead to increased labour supply than to lower unemployment. This is also what 
Labour Force Survey flow statistics show. Further reduction in unemployment 
requires measures from other policy areas. 
The third and final challenge is the fact that skills matching on the labour market 
has deteriorated. This implies that output and employment are not as high as they 
could have been without the matching problems. Monetary policy can scarcely 
improve matching on the Swedish labour market. Here, too, measures in other 
policy areas are required. It is a question of increasing productivity among 
unemployed persons and reducing the cost of employing them. Labour market 
policy has a crucial role to play here.
