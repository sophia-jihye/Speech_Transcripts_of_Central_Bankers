Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy 
Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Niigata 
Masazumi Wakatabe 
Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan 
(English translation based on the Japanese original) 
Introduction 
It  is  my  pleasure  to  have  the  opportunity  today  to  exchange  views  with  administrative, 
financial,  and  business  leaders  in  Niigata  Prefecture.  I  also  would  like  to  take  this 
opportunity  to  express  my  sincere  gratitude  for  your  cooperation  with the activities  of  the 
Bank of Japan's Niigata Branch. 
 This is my first time to attend a meeting of this kind since I was appointed Deputy Governor 
of the Bank of Japan in March this year. It is said that people here in the Echigo and Sado 
regions  historically  have  overcome  severe  natural  environment  --  such  as  dealing  with 
heavy snow, crossing over mountain ridges, and managing floods -- with diligence, patience, 
and  great  ingenuity.1  I  would  like  to  hear  your  views  on  the  current  status  of  the  local 
economy,  as  well  as  your  candid  opinions  about  the  Bank's  policies  and  activities.  First,  I 
will  briefly  explain  developments  in  Japan's  economic  activity  and  prices,  and  then  talk 
about the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. 
 I. Current Developments in Economic Activity and Prices 
Let  me  start  by  talking  about  the  current  developments  in  economic  activity.  Japan's 
economy is expanding moderately. The real economic growth rate excluding the effects of 
price  movements,  after  registering  relatively  high  growth  of  3.0  percent  on  an  annualized 
basis in the April-June quarter of this year, marked negative growth of minus 1.2 percent in 
the  July-September  quarter.  This  likely  is  mainly  due  to  temporary  factors  accompanying 
natural disasters that occurred successively this summer. Such a view is underpinned by the 
fact that exports and production, which had declined due to the effects of natural disasters, 
have turned to an increase since October. 
 The current economic recovery phase likely has lasted for six years already,  which mostly 
overlaps  with  the  period  of  quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary  easing  (QQE)  that  the 
Bank introduced in April 2013, and this month its duration is expected to be the same as the

longest post-war recovery phase in the mid-2000s (Chart 1).2  I would like to point out two 
characteristics of the current prolonged economic recovery, as follows. 
 A.  First  Characteristic  of  the  Current  Recovery:  Economic  Recovery  Being 
Widespread 
The  first  characteristic is that  the economic  recovery  has  been  widespread,  bringing  about 
benefits to a wide range of economic entities. 
 First, in the corporate sector, there has been notable improvement not only in large firms but 
also  small  and  medium-sized  firms  (Chart  2).  For  example,  according  to  our  Tankan 
(Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan), the proportion of small enterprises 
responding  that  their  business  conditions  have  been  "favorable"  clearly  has  exceeded  the 
proportion  of  those  responding  that  they  have  been  "unfavorable"  for  the  first  time  since 
1991. Corporate profits also have improved widely, with domestic demand increasing under 
large-scale  monetary  easing.  In  particular,  profits  of  small  and  medium-sized  firms  that 
support  regional  economies  clearly  have  increased.  This  is  a  characteristic  that  was  not 
observed in the economic recovery phase in the mid-2000s, when improvement in corporate 
profits  was  uneven,  seen  mainly  in  large  manufacturing  firms  that  benefited  from  high 
growth in overseas economies. 
 Such  improvement  in  the  corporate  sector  --  including  small  and  medium-sized  firms  in 
local areas -- has led to firms' more active spending, such as business fixed investment, and 
its  effects  also  have  spread  to  the  household  sector  through  increases  in  employment  and 
                                                   
2  The  following  studies  assess  that  the  Bank's  QQE  from  2013  has  pushed  up  production  and  the 
inflation  rate,  and  also  has  led  to  increased  employment:  (1)  Miyao  Ryuzo,  Hi  dentōteki  kin'yū

wages.  The  number  of  job  openings  has  increased  significantly,  with  the  active  job 
openings-to-applicants ratio currently standing in the range of 1.6-1.7, a level that exceeds 
the  peak  of  the  bubble  period  in  the  late  1980s  (Chart  3).  Labor  market  conditions  have 
been tightening across Japan, and the active job openings-to-applicants ratios recently have 
exceeded  1  in  all  prefectures,  which  was  not  observed  even  in  the  bubble  period.  At  the 
same time, the unemployment rate has declined in a wide range of regions. 
 An  improvement  in  the labor  market  has  been  widespread  across  generations  as  well.  For 
example,  the  unemployment  rate  of  the  younger  generation  aged  15-24  rose  substantially 
amid the Japanese financial crisis of the late 1990s, and declined only moderately for a long 
time  after  that  (Chart  4).  However,  the  situation  has  changed  dramatically  in  the  past  few 
years. The youth unemployment rate has declined to a level below that of the bubble period, 
and labor market conditions for new graduates have created more of a seller's market than 
ever  before.  With  the  perception  of  labor  shortage  heightening  further,  the  number  of 
long-term  unemployed  workers  -- those  unemployed  for  over  a  year  --  has been  declining 
steadily, although it used to be considered quite difficult for them to find a job. In addition, 
improvement  in  the  employment  situation  has  contributed  to  providing  new 
job 
opportunities for those who had not participated in the labor market before. The population 
aged  15-64  that  has  played  a  major  role  in  the  labor  market,  or  the  so-called  working-age 
population,  has  been  declining  from  the  peak  in  around  2000.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
number of employed persons recently has been increasing substantially (Chart 5). This is a 
result  of  labor  participation  by  women  and  seniors  promoted  through  improvement  in 
employment  together  with  the  development  of  various  labor-related  measures  by  the 
government.  In  addition,  the  poverty  rate,  which  has  risen  moderately  since  the  1990s, 
recently seems to have flattened or declined somewhat. 
 The declines in the youth unemployment rate and long-term unemployment rate, as well as 
the increase in labor participation by women and seniors, are significant not only in terms of 
increasing  the  current  employment  and  production  but  also  strengthening  the  growth 
potential of the economy in the future. People acquire skills through actually working each 
day  and  thereby  raise  their  productivity.  In  particular,  whether  or  not  people  have  job 
opportunities  to  enhance  skills  in  their  youth  is  likely  to  significantly  affect  their  future 
 3 
careers  as  well  as  the  productivity  of  an  economy  as  a  whole.  Given  this,  it  is  very 
important  to  provide  diverse  and  stable  job  opportunities  for  the  younger  generation.  The 
decline in the long-term unemployment rate also leads to raising the economy's productivity, 
since  skills  could  be  lost  gradually  as  the  duration  of  unemployment  becomes  prolonged. 
Widespread  improvement  in  the  labor  market  is  likely  to  raise  the  growth  potential  of 
Japan's economy. 
 B. Second Characteristic of the Current Recovery: Inflation Rate Turning Positive 
The  second  characteristic  of  the  current  economic  recovery  is  that  wages  and  prices  have 
turned to an increase under large-scale monetary easing, which is different from the case in 
the mid-2000s, when prices continued on a declining trend. The year-on-year rate of change 
in  the  consumer  price  index  (CPI)  has  been  on  an  uptrend  for  more  than  five  years  since 
autumn  2013,  and  Japan's  economy  is  no  longer  in  deflation,  in  the  sense  of  a  sustained 
decline  in  prices  (Chart  6).  Price  developments  clearly  have  improved  compared  to  the 
period  prior  to  the  introduction  of  QQE,  when  the  economy  experienced  prolonged 
deflation. However, while the Bank's price stability target is to achieve the inflation rate of 2 
percent,  the  current  rate  is  at  around  1  percent.  I  will  later  talk  about  this  point  in  detail, 
together with the Bank's monetary policy. 
 II. Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices 
Now I would like to explain the outlook for economic activity and prices. 
 A. Outlook for Economic Activity 
I  will  first  touch  upon  the  outlook  for  economic  activity.  Japan's  economy  is  expected  to 
continue on an expanding trend from fiscal 2019 through  fiscal 2020. Corporate profits at 
high  levels  and  improvement  in  the  employment  situation  are  expected  to  bring  about 
increases  in  business  fixed  investment  and  private  consumption,  with  overseas  economies 
continuing to grow firmly on the whole. 
 However, there are various risk factors to this baseline scenario, including developments in 
overseas economies. In particular, the consequences of the trade friction between the United 
States and China still warrant some attention. In addition to this friction, various problems 
 4 
exist  between  the  two  countries,  including  those  regarding  intellectual  property  rights, 
technology transfer, and national security. Thus, the situation may remain highly uncertain 
ahead  of  resolution  of  these  problems.  At  this  point,  the  impact  of  these  problems  on 
economic  activity  at  home  and  abroad  is  likely  to  be  limited.  However,  if  the  problems 
become  more  complex  and  prolonged,  downward  pressure  on  the  global  economy  could 
heighten  not  only  through  the  gradual  spread  of  the  negative  effects  on  trade  activity,  but 
also  deterioration  in  firms'  fixed  investment  stance  and  cautiousness  in  financial  market 
sentiment. Looking back, the Great Depression of the 1930s is well known as a period when 
protectionist  policies  prevailed  around  the  world.  Subsequent  research  suggests  that  what 
mainly brought about the significant global economic downturn was severe deflation under 
fiscal and monetary policies not responding appropriately, rather than protectionist policies.3 
Therefore,  policy  authorities  worldwide  should  bear  in  mind  the  importance  of  fiscal  and 
monetary  policy  management.  Furthermore,  attention  should  be  paid  to  the  fact  that  it  is 
difficult  to  analyze  the  effects  of  protectionist  moves  on  the  economy.4  This  is  partly 
because  trade  structure  characterized  by  the  network  of  global  supply  chains  is  far  more 
complex compared to that in the 1930s, the share of trade volume in the global economy has 
increased,  and  the  amount  of  global  capital  flows  has  become  massive.  The  Bank  will 
thoroughly examine the consequences of recent developments in the trade friction and their 
potential effects on Japan's economy. 
 B. Outlook for Prices 
As for the outlook for prices, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI in Japan is likely to 
increase  gradually  with  the  economy  continuing  on  an  expanding  trend.  The  outlook  for 
prices is considered to be determined basically by two factors: the supply-demand balance 
of  the  economy  as  a  whole  and  people's  expectations  for  future  price  developments. 
Regarding the supply-demand balance, the tendency of  demand exceeding supply  is likely 
                                                   
3  For  example,  see  Douglas  A.  Irwin,  Clashing  over  Commerce:  A  History  of  US  Trade  Policy 
(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2017), 397-400. 
4  While traded goods were mainly primary products at the time of the Great Depression, the share of 
manufactured goods in trade is large at present. As the proportion of manufactured goods increases 
among  traded  goods,  trade  volume  tends  to  fluctuate  to  a  larger  degree  in  response  to  changes  in 
income.  For  details,  see  Douglas  A.  Irwin,  Trade  Policy  Disaster:  Lessons  from  the  1930s 
(Cambridge: MIT Press, 2012), 167n25. 
 5 
to  continue  with  the  economy  following  an  expanding  trend.  As  actual  wages  and  prices 
increase  along  with  this  development,  people's  inflation  expectations  are  expected  to  rise 
gradually, and thus moderate inflation is more likely to be achieved. 
 There are various risk factors to the outlook for prices as well. For example, we cannot deny 
the  possibility  that  actual  wages  and  prices  will  not  rise  easily  despite  excess  demand 
continuing going forward. Even when wages and prices rise, there is a possibility that such 
movements  will  be  perceived  as  a  temporary  phenomenon  and  people's  inflation 
expectations will not rise. Moreover, the scheduled consumption tax hike in October 2019 
poses another risk for economic activity and prices.5 
 Households in Japan tend to respond sensitively to price rises, partly because they have not 
experienced  inflation  for  a  long  time.  Reflecting  such  behavior  of  households,  firms  have 
been cautious about raising prices of products. As the economy continues to improve,  this 
cautious  stance  of  firms  and  households  is  likely  to  dissipate  gradually,  although  there  is 
uncertainty as to when this change will occur. Such a situation may be due in part to a lack 
of  public  understanding  regarding  the  reasons  why  economic  expansion  accompanying 
moderate  inflation  is  desirable  and  of  public  confidence  in  the  Bank's  determination  to 
achieve  it.  If  this  is  the  case,  the  Bank  should  never  be  complacent  and  continue  making 
efforts  to  communicate  better to  the  public.  I  would  like to  talk  about this  point  hereafter, 
together with the discussion on monetary policy. 
 III. Monetary Policy 
Let  me  now  move  on  to  monetary  policy.  The  Bank  has  continued  large-scale  monetary 
easing  by,  for  example,  maintaining  10-year  Japanese  government  bond  (JGB)  yields  at 
extremely low levels of around zero percent through purchasing large amounts of JGBs in 
                                                   
5  As  shown  in  the  Bank's  Comprehensive  Assessment  released  in  September  2016,  there  are  three 
reasons why the inflation rate did not reach the price stability target of 2 percent within two years as 
initially  expected:  the  decline  in  crude  oil  prices,  the  slowdown  in  emerging  economies,  and  the 
consumption tax hike. The Bank estimates that  the net burden on households  due to  the scheduled 
consumption tax hike in October 2019 will be smaller than that at the time of the tax hike in April 
2014.  However,  it  is  necessary  to  carefully  examine  the  effects  of  the  scheduled  consumption  tax 
hike on people's consumption behavior and inflation expectations.

the market. It also has committed to continuing with such monetary easing going forward. 
In  what  follows,  I  would  like  to  talk  about  the  Bank's  basic  thinking  as  to  why  it  is 
continuing with monetary easing and what it aims to achieve. 
 A. Negative Effects of Deflation 
Why is the Bank aiming at price stability? Needless to say, households and private firms are 
the main players in a market economy, but a market economy sometimes may not function 
well.  Therefore,  the  government  and  public  institutions  would  need  to  complement  it 
properly. Price stability is one of the areas in which public institutions should be involved.6 
 The principle of the Bank's monetary policy is stipulated by the Bank of Japan Act. Article 
2 prescribes that "[c]urrency and monetary control by the Bank of Japan shall be aimed at 
achieving  price  stability,  thereby  contributing  to  the  sound  development  of  the  national 
economy."  The  ultimate  objective  is  not  price  stability  itself  but  the  resultant  sound 
development  of  the  national  economy,  generally  accompanied  by  improvements  in 
employment and household income. Historically, the economy was negatively affected not 
only  by  rapid  inflation,  such as  experienced after World War  II  and  in the 1970s,  but  also 
serious  deflation  around  the  time  of  the  Showa  Depression  in  the  prewar  period  and 
deflation that lasted for about 15 years since the late 1990s. 
 Although people tend to think price declines are favorable because goods can be purchased 
at  a  cheaper  price,  they  actually  give  rise  to  significant  negative  effects  in  three  respects. 
First, declines in prices refer not only to those of goods and services that you purchase, but 
also  those  of  goods  and  services  that  your  firm  sells.  If  sales  of  your  firm  decrease,  this 
reduces  your  salary  and  consequently  the  budget  available  for  spending,  or  can  lead  to 
cutbacks in employment. As a result, economic activity as a whole will contract. 
                                                    
6  In the context of price stability, prices refer to the aggregated prices of goods and services in the 
economy  as  a  whole,  which  differ  from  individual  prices  of  goods  and  services.  In  the  long  run, 
prices on an aggregate basis are determined by the relationship between the total amount of goods 
and services transacted in the economy and money. That is, in the long run, prices will rise if money 
increases,  and  will  decline  if  it  decreases.  In  modern  society,  most  money  is  in  the  form  of  bank 
deposits, which are created partly by bank lending, and its base is issued by the central bank. 
 7 
Second,  price  declines  bring  about  difficulties  in  conducting  economic  policies.  In  an 
economy where prices decline, tax revenue does not increase easily. Price declines also may 
be  an  obstacle  to  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy.  When  an  economy  is  under  downward 
pressure,  it  usually  becomes  necessary  to  reduce  interest  rates  to  support  the  economy. 
Theoretically  and  empirically,  however,  interest  rate  levels  tend  to  decrease  to  around  0 
percent  when  prices  decline  (Chart  7).  Thus,  room for  monetary  policy  response  becomes 
smaller if we rely only on the conventional policy of lowering interest rates, which would 
make economic depression more severe. 
 Third,  when economic  depression  lasts  for  a  long  time  amid  price declines,  there  is a  risk 
that  the  growth  potential of  the  economy  would  be  lowered and the behavior  and  mindset 
based on the assumption that prices do not rise will become entrenched  in the society, as I 
mentioned earlier. In other economies, nominal GDP and nominal income increase steadily 
amid moderate inflation. From a global perspective, I have to say that the past situation for 
Japan's economy was quite exceptional, in that nominal GDP and nominal income  peaked 
out and subsequently leveled off for a long time under prolonged deflation (Chart 8). Price 
declines may bring about significant negative effects  on the economy, even if their pace is 
moderate or does not accelerate. 
 B. Price Stability Target of 2 Percent 
On  this  basis,  price  stability  needed  for  the  sound  development  of  the  national  economy 
involves avoiding not only rapid inflation but also deflation. Metaphorically speaking, this 
is like maintaining a comfortable room temperature. A room's temperature should not be too 
hot  or cold.  So,  as  for  prices,  should  we aim at literally  0  percent  inflation? In  a  situation 
where  the  inflation  rate  is  around  0  percent,  room  for  monetary  policy  response  through 
interest  rate  control  would  be  limited,  as  I  mentioned  earlier.  Under  such  circumstances, 
there  is  a  risk  of  economic  stagnation  and  deflation  becoming  prolonged  once  downward 
pressure is exerted on the economy. Thus, one can draw the conclusion that the "appropriate 
level of temperature for the economy"  -- in other words, the inflation rate at which central 
 8 
banks should aim -- is not literally 0 percent but a sufficiently positive figure, which secures 
room for monetary policy response to avoid deflation.7 
 In relation to the "appropriate level of temperature for the economy," an increasing number 
of  central  banks  worldwide  have  adopted  inflation  targeting  as  a  framework  for  monetary 
policy, and setting the target level at around 2 percent has become a global standard among 
advanced  economies  and  regions  (Chart  9).8  As  financial  markets  and  economies  are 
closely linked internationally, aiming at 2 percent inflation when other economies do so has 
an  important  implication.  For  example,  while  it  should  be  noted  that  the  Bank's  monetary 
policy does not target foreign exchange rates, the fact that Japan aims at achieving the same 
inflation rate as many other economies, including the United States and Europe, is likely to 
stabilize  foreign  exchange  rates  from  a  long-term  perspective,  and  thereby  contribute  to 
establishing  a  business  environment  that  enables  firms  to  make  decisions  easily  and 
continue with their activities without unnecessary anxiety. 
 Based  on  these  considerations,  the  Bank  has  set  2  percent  inflation  as  the  price  stability 
target and committed to achieving it. This is the Bank's commitment and a declaration to the 
general public. As long as this is ensured, the experience of the deflationary era will not be 
repeated.  At  present,  although  the  inflation  rate  in  Japan  is  improving  steadily,  it  has 
remained at around 1 percent, and thus we are only halfway to achieving 2 percent inflation. 
In  a  case  where  downward  pressure  is  exerted  on  the  economy  again,  it  may  revert  to 
deflation. The Bank will encourage a rise in the inflation rate to the level that is appropriate 
for  the  economy  by  continuing  large-scale  monetary  easing  with  the  aim  of  achieving  2 
                                                   
7  Those  who  proposed  inflation  targeting  at  an  early  stage  considered  that  the  most  convincing 
reason for aiming at a positive inflation rate was avoiding a risk of falling into deflation. For details, 
see  Ben  S.  Bernanke  et  al.,  Inflation  Targeting:  Lessons  from  the  International  Experience 
(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1999), 29-30. 
8  Although  it  depends  on  the  definition,  approximately  40  central  banks  now  adopt  inflation 
targeting.  For  details,  see  José  De Gregorio  et  al.,  "IMF  Reform:  The  Unfinished  Agenda," CEPR 
(2018): 12.

percent  inflation  and  thereby  maintaining  economic  improvement  for  a  sufficiently  long 
period.9 
 In  continuing  with  monetary  easing,  it  is  necessary  to  continuously  examine  not  only  the 
effectiveness  on  inflation but  also  the impact  on  the  financial markets and  system.  This  is 
expected to enhance the sustainability of the policy and consequently raise the certainty of 
achieving 2 percent inflation.10 
 C. Communication to the General Public 
In  order  to  enhance  policy  effects,  I  think  that  it  is  important  for  the  Bank  to  engage  in 
information  dissemination  and  communication  so  that  as  many  people  as  possible  would 
understand the state of the economy that the Bank aims to achieve, as well as its underlying 
thinking.  The  conventional  monetary  policy  that  we  learned  at  school  mainly  focuses  on 
raising  or  lowering  interest  rates,  which  was  relatively  easy  to  understand.  However,  in 
Japan since the late 1990s and in the United States and Europe since the Global Financial 
Crisis in the late 2000s, short-term interest rates have been close to 0 percent, which is an 
environment  that  cannot  be  dealt  with  only  through  conventional  monetary  policy.  Under 
these circumstances, central banks actively adopted the so-called unconventional monetary 
policy. This produced extremely powerful effects during the course of the global economy 
moving  out  of  the  Global  Financial  Crisis.  At  the  same  time,  however,  monetary  policy 
became  highly  complex  and  difficult  to  understand  for  some  non-experts.  Outside  Japan, 
                                                   
9  There are various debates over why the target level of inflation should be 2 percent, or what would 
be the most desirable inflation rate. Recent studies increasingly suggest that the desirable inflation 
rate be positive in view of preventing a risk of falling into deflation, based on the experience of the 
Global  Financial  Crisis  from  2008.  However,  the  proposed  specific  figure  ranges  widely  from  a 
positive rate close to 0 percent to around 6 percent. Meanwhile, Seiji Adachi argues that, using the 
data for Japan's economy from 1983 through the second quarter of 2017, the inflation rate that would 
be achieved under certain conditions in a time of an inflationary regime is 1.94 percent in terms of 
the CPI inflation rate excluding fresh food and energy.  For details, see Adachi Seiji, "2 pāsento no 
infure mokuhyō wa datō ka," Keiki to Saikuru, no. 64 (2017): 3-16. 
10  The Bank  has been  making  a  wide  variety  of  efforts  including  conducting on-site  examinations 
and  off-site  monitoring  of  individual  financial  institutions,  providing  a  wide  range  of  information 
such as through the Financial System Report, and cooperating with relevant regulatory authorities in 
the development of financial regulations. 
 10 
some appear to have joked that central banks' public statements can only be understood by 
those with a Ph.D. in economics. 
 It  is  true  that  the  Bank's  current  policy  is  somewhat  technical,  and  we  are  expected  to 
communicate in detail to gain understanding from experts including market participants and 
overseas authorities. Nevertheless, it is important for central banks to reach out not only to 
experts but also households and firms, which play the main roles of and are driving forces 
for Japan's economy.11  Regarding households and firms, I am aware that it is important to 
reiterate  the  essence  of  the  policy  --  that  is,  what  the  Bank  aims  at  and  how  it  seeks  to 
achieve this -- rather than the details that tend to be highly technical. 
 For  example,  according  to  a  survey  conducted  by  the  Bank,  many  households  think  that 
their circumstances become worse off when prices rise (Chart 10). No one welcomes price 
rises when their own income does not increase. Thus, it may seem natural that households' 
tolerance of price rises would not increase easily, but wages generally grew at a higher pace 
than inflation and households' purchasing power rose in the past phase of moderate inflation 
(Chart 11). In order to change the cautious stance of households that tend to be reluctant to 
accept price rises, it also is important to explain this basic mechanism of the economy in a 
way  that  is  easy  to  understand.  In  addition,  the  effects  of  monetary  policy  depend  on 
economic  conditions.  The  expected  growth  rate  of  Japan's  economy  is  likely  to  rise  as 
private  firms  actively  undertake  investment  in  capital  and  human  resources  as  well  as 
innovation,  or as  the  government establishes  a  business  environment  that  encourages  such 
investment for the future or makes beneficial public spending, including that for education 
as well as for the promotion of science and technology, while securing confidence in fiscal 
sustainability.  As  the  expected  growth  rate  rises,  monetary  easing  will  more  significantly 
boost  the  willingness  of  firms  to  invest  and  households  to  consume,  thereby  further 
ensuring  the  path  toward  achieving  the  price  stability  target  of  2  percent.  Thus,  there  are 
synergy  effects  between  efforts  by  various  economic  entities  and  the  Bank's  monetary 
policy. With a view to sharing  among various entities the significance of these effects, the 
                                                   
11  For a study that underlines the importance of influencing households' and firms' expectations, see, 
for example, Olivier Coibion et al., "Inflation Expectations as a Policy Tool?" NBER Working Paper, 
no. 24788 (2018).

Bank needs to communicate effectively to a wide range of people. 
 I suppose that those attending this meeting also experience situations where it is necessary 
to convey a message to residents and clients in plain language while engaging in complex 
day-to-day operations. The same applies to monetary policy. Taking account of this, I have 
explained today the essence of the Bank's thinking behind monetary policy. 
 Conclusion 
Lastly,  I  would  like  to  talk  about  the  economy  of  Niigata  Prefecture.  The  economy  has 
continued to recover steadily. Exports and production have maintained their relatively high 
levels,  mainly  on  the  back  of  favorable  external  demand.  Amid  high  levels  of  corporate 
profits,  business  fixed  investment  intended  for  enhancing  capacity  and  saving  labor  has 
increased.  With  labor  market  conditions  tightening,  employee  income  has  increased 
moderately and private consumption also has recovered moderately. 
 On the other hand, Niigata Prefecture is facing challenges such as population decline, labor 
shortage,  and  sluggish  final  demand.  However,  the  prefecture's  economy  has  some 
advantages in overcoming these challenges and thereby achieving economic growth. 
 For  instance,  there  is  an  agglomeration  of  industries  with  high  technological  prowess  in  a 
wide  range  of  fields  such  as  metals,  machinery,  food,  materials,  and  construction.  In 
addition, the information and communications industry has started to make advancements, 
as partly evidenced by launches of new IT firms. As traditionally strong industries adjust to 
globalization  and  technological  progress,  and  new  industries  such  as  the  information  and 
communications  industry  start  up,  the  growth  potential  of  the  prefecture's  economy  is 
expected to heighten further. 
 Moreover,  Niigata  Prefecture  is  blessed  with  a  varied  culture  and  history,  as  well  as 
abundant  nature  and  food.  This  summer,  I  enjoyed  an  exhibition  at  the  Tokyo  National 
Museum entitled "JOMON: 10,000 Years of Prehistoric Art in Japan." I was overwhelmed 
by  the  sublime  beauty  of  the  national  treasure  from  Niigata  Prefecture  --  a  vessel  with 
flame-like ornamentation from the Sasayama site in Tōkamachi city. The prefecture is also 
 12 
famous  for  its  sake  (rice  wine),  and  this  owes  to  the  entrepreneurial  spirit  that  sought  to 
diversify product lines and enhance their quality against the background of declining prices 
of rice in the Edo era that resulted from excess supply.12  Furthermore, while Koshihikari is 
now a byword for delicious rice, efforts were needed to overcome many difficulties to get to 
that point.13 
 Another  significant  advantage  is  that  the  prefecture  is  close  to  the  growing  economies  of 
northeast Asia. It has close historical relations with regions on the opposite shores, such  as 
the  Russian  Far  East,  China,  and  the  Korean  Peninsula.  With  the  traditions  of  trade  via 
Kitamaebune,  or  northern-bound  ships,  Niigata  Prefecture  now  has  the  potential  as  the 
largest foothold for international interaction along the Sea of Japan to capture demand from 
fast-growing Asian economies, both in terms of trade and tourism. 
 January 2019 marks the 150th anniversary since the Niigata port was opened to the world as 
a  trade  port  ahead  of  many  other  ones.  As  I  mentioned  at  the  outset,  people  here  in  the 
Echigo  and  Sado  regions  historically  have  overcome  challenges  with  their  diligence, 
patience,  and  ingenuity.  I  would  like  to  close  by  expressing  my  hope  that  you  will  be 
frontrunners in terms of overcoming deflation and vitalizing local economies while making 
the most of the prefecture's advantages. 
 Thank you very much for your attention. 
                                                    
12  According to a history book, sake breweries in Niigata Prefecture in the Edo era tried to grasp the 
taste of consumers  by inviting specialists  based long distances away. Specifically,  Buzaemon from 
the Uonuma Shiozawa region, who started a sake brewery in the late 1600s, and Kaemon from the 
same  region  invited  tōji  --  sake  brewers  --  from  Kyoto  and  Tokyo,  respectively.  For  details,  see 
Tanaka  Keiichi  et  al.,  Niigata-ken  no  rekishi,  2nd  ed.  (Tokyo:  Yamakawa  Shuppansha  Ltd.,  2009), 
166-67. 
13  Koshihikari  originally  was developed at an agricultural experiment station in Niigata Prefecture 
during wartime in 1944, when quantity generally was prioritized over taste, and its breeding business 
subsequently was suspended. After the launch of the Koshihikari brand, the Agricultural Cooperative 
Association of Niigata Prefecture spared no marketing efforts to enhance its brand value ahead of the 
competitors.  For  details,  see  Sakai  Yoshiaki,  Koshihikari  monogatari:  nippon-ichi  umai  kome  no 
tanjō (Tokyo: Chuokoron-Shinsha, Inc., 1997).
