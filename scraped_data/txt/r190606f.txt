    It is a pleasure to be at the IIF. I would like to speak today about your raison d’etre: sustainable cross border 
capital flows.  
Capital flows can be an enormous force for good.  For example, when my native Canada was an emerging 
economy, net capital inflows averaged 10% of GDP every year for around three decades.  
But the recent history of capital flows is more chequered. 
After all, the IIF was founded 36 years ago in response to the Latin American debt crisis.  That crisis was the 
product of an initially well founded and productive – but ultimately over exuberant and destructive – recycling 
of petro dollars by the banking system. 
That period provided painful examples both of how capital flows can support development and how capital 
flow volatility can undermine it. 
The Asian crisis almost 15 years later underscored the risks of relying on inflows that look stable but prove 
ephemeral.  And subsequent crises in Latin America around the turn of the millennium and in advanced 
economies (AEs) a decade ago reinforced the risks of taking capital flows for granted. 
In theory, foreign capital inflows should support growth through greater allocative efficiency, better risk sharing 
and increased technology transfer.  
But in reality financial openness has proven a double-edged sword.  The typical emerging market economy 
(EME) receiving higher capital inflows will grow 0.3 percentage points faster, all else equal (Chart 1).  But the 
typical EME with higher capital flow volatility will grow 0.7 percentage points slower (Chart 2).1

   Time and again, waves of investment into EMEs are sharply withdrawn (Chart 3).  And more generally, 
financial openness has tended to amplify domestic imbalances and leave EMEs more vulnerable to foreign 
shocks.2 
As a consequence, a fifth of all surges in capital flows to EMEs have ended in financial crises.  And EMEs are 
at least three times more likely to experience a financial crisis after capital flow surges than in normal times.3

   Given the uncertainty over the sustainability of capital inflows, EMEs have defensively accumulated reserves 
and limited the opening of their capital accounts, including by resorting to overt capital flow management in 
some cases.  Overall, EMEs have increased their financial openness by considerably less than advanced 
economies (AEs) since 1980, leaving their external balance sheets only around a third the size of those in 
AEs, despite much faster growth in external trade (Chart 4).  
These responses, while understandable, carry significant opportunity costs.  Excess precautionary savings in 
EMEs are pushing down equilibrium interest rates, increasing the risks of a global liquidity trap.  And 
enormous cross border flows will be required to close EME infrastructure investment gaps and to finance the 
essential transition to a low carbon economy. 
Today, I want to examine what drives capital flow volatility and, in the process, sketch an agenda for 
sustainable capital flows in the new world order. 
Specifically, what should be the priorities to increase sustainable cross border capital flows?  How many are 
the responsibility of the receiving country?  What about the advanced economies who set the tone for the 
global financial cycle?  And to what extent does the structure of the international monetary financial system 
itself, including the global safety net, determine safe flows? 
To begin to answer these questions, the Bank of England is developing a holistic “Capital Flows-at-Risk” 
framework that assesses the relative contribution of the three drivers of Capital Flows-at-Risk:4 
 ‘Pull factors’ – domestic conditions and institutions that affect the relative attractiveness of investing in an 
individual country.  
 ‘Push factors’ – that determine global risk appetite and financial conditions, particularly the level and 
prospects for US monetary policy and financial stability.  
 ‘The Pipes’ – the structure of the global financial system itself, particularly the degree to which it dampens 
or amplifies shocks.  
                                                        
4  This builds on early work by the IMF presented in the October 2018 Global Financial Stability Report relating to portfolio flows.  More 
details on the Bank of England work will be forthcoming in a Working Paper.

Notes: This chart shows the unconditional distribution of capital flows to EMEs over 2006-2018, and an estimated 
distribution conditional on a one standard deviation negative shock to pull factors.  The diamonds highlight the fifth 
percentile, which is our preferred measure of Capital Flows-at-Risk.  We estimate several quantiles of the distribution 
through quantile regression and then fit a skewed-t distribution; hence, the distribution can both shift and change shape 
in response to shocks - see annex for further details.  
The grey line in Chart 5 shows the unconditional distribution of capital flows, and the purple line shows how 
the distribution shifts in response to a negative shock.  “Capital Flows-at-Risk” are defined as capital outflows 
in a severe, low-probability event (that with 5% probability or less). The left tail ‘fattens’ if bad outcomes 
become more likely and/or the “5% probability event” becomes more severe – shown by the shift from A 
(Capital Flows-at-Risk of 1.2% of GDP) to B (Capital Flows-at-Risk of 4.2% of GDP).  
The Bank’s framework can be used to assess policy options and associated trade-offs, and to communicate 
policy decisions.  
Today, I will provide some tentative conclusions in order to spur further debate and analysis, including as part 
of the IMF’s work on its “Integrated Policy Framework” and the G20 discussions on the future of the financial 
architecture. 
Our core finding is that the distribution of capital flows will shift and change shape when there is a change in 
any of the three drivers – pull, push or pipes.5  In an interdependent world, everyone – advanced economies, 
                                                      
5 The Capital Flows-at-Risk model presented in chart 6 does not explicitly model ‘the pipes’. The impact of augmenting 
the framework with pipes is shown later on in charts [15 and 16].

   emerging economies as well as the public and private sectors – is responsible for reducing capital flow 
volatility and increasing sustainable capital flows in order to meet the challenges of our age. 
Turning to the three drivers in more detail. 
Pull factors 
The conventional wisdom, prior to the financial crisis, was that the best contribution each country can do for 
itself and others would be to “keep its own house in order”.6  
The foundations of that house are: 
  Credible inflation targeting regimes.  Credible domestic frameworks for implementing monetary policy 
– with an operationally independent and accountable central bank at their core – have generally 
delivered inflation rates that are both lower and less variable.7  This directly benefits all citizens in 
good times.  Moreover, greater monetary policy credibility gives a central bank more scope to respond 
to shocks, and enables financial markets to anticipate better the path for monetary policy, thereby 
providing a stabilising force during bad times.  During the taper tantrum, those economies with better-
anchored inflation expectations were able to keep monetary policy relatively more accommodative. 8 
  Flexible exchange rates. A flexible exchange rate acts as a valuable shock absorber for an economy 
because domestic wages and prices are relatively “sticky” (in other words, slow to adjust). For 
example, suppose there is a spike in global risk aversion. As capital flows are withdrawn flexible 
exchange rates depreciate. In general, this boosts an economy’s competitiveness. However, where 
economies borrow heavily in foreign currency, and this exposure is unhedged, depreciations can be 
detrimental for the economy.9  
  Fiscal sustainability.  A sustainable fiscal position provides governments with more room to respond to 
adverse shocks to demand.  Financial markets therefore reward more sustainable fiscal positions: the 
IMF found that declines in inflows between 2010 and 2015 were 1 percentage points of GDP larger for 
countries with above-average public debt ratios.10  Fiscal sustainability is also necessary for a credible 
nominal anchor.

they can amplify the impact of push shocks via a collateral valuation effect

     An effective macroprudential policy toolkit to curtail the damaging extremes of domestic financial 
cycles.  Macroprudential policy can guard against rapid credit growth, which is amongst the best early 
warning indicators of an impending downturn.11  And higher domestic bank capital ratios reduce the 
sensitivity of capital inflows to changes in global volatility.12  
  And deep domestic capital markets to reduce the reliance on foreign investors and the need to issue 
in foreign currency, which dampens capital flow volatility (Chart 6).

Notes: The grey bars on this chart show the unconditional 5th percentile of the distribution of capital flows in a panel 
of 13 EMEs since 1996. The purple bars build on the contribution of pull factors to the conditional 5th percentile of 
capital flows in the current quarter and two quarters ahead. Pull factors are proxied by domestic financial condition 
indices (DFCIs), which are mean-orthogonalised by a global financial conditions index (GFCI). The coefficient on the 
DFCIs is estimated by panel quantile regressions. The chart shows PPP-weighted averages across the 13 EMEs in 
our panel. See Annex for further details. 
 The Bank of England’s analysis finds that the conventional prescription to concentrate on putting one’s own 
house in order had merit: pull factors were the main drivers of capital flow instability prior to the 2008 crisis 
(Chart 7).  Over the years, this advice has been taken to heart.13  
80% of EMEs are now inflation-targeters, compared to none just prior to the Asian Financial Crisis.  These 
regimes have generally been successful: inflation has been low and stable across EMEs since the mid-2000s 
at a median rate of 2.5%, close to the rate in AEs.  In many respects, the exceptions such as Argentina and 
Turkey prove the norm. 
Fiscal policy is more of a mixed picture; debt ratios are lower than in advanced economies but fiscal deficits 
have widened materially in recent years. 
In general, the resilience of emerging economy banking systems has increased with implementation of most of 
the FSB post-crisis reforms on track.  EMEs are the most active users of macroprudential policy. 
                                                      
13 In the model pull factors are proxied by domestic financial conditions (mean-orthogonalised by global financial conditions), which 
encompass market views about domestic institutional frameworks.

   However, while there has been progress in developing domestic capital markets – the depth of EME financial 
markets has doubled since the turn of millennium – this has been insufficient to meet rising financing needs.  
As a result, the share of FX-denominated debt has increased sharply (Chart 8). 
And while domestic markets have deepened, the share of foreign ownership in EME local currency bond 
markets has risen, up from 5% on average pre-crisis to around 25% today.

 Despite these vulnerabilities, the Bank’s analysis finds that, for EMEs as a whole, reforms to domestic 
institutional “pull factors” have substantially increased the sustainability of capital flows and so shifted the 
distribution of capital flows to the right (Chart 9), all else equal.

Notes: Chart shows the contribution of pull factors to capital flows to EMEs during the Asian Financial Crisis (purple), 
and since 2008 (green). In both distributions push factors are held at their sample average, so only pull factors are 
changing. See chart 5 and annex for further details.  
 Push factors 
Unfortunately for EMEs, all else has not been equal. The importance of “push factors” has increased over time 
as monetary policy and financial stability shocks in advanced economies have become both more prevalent 
and more potent.    
And push factors are arguably becoming more important as the fundamental asymmetry at the heart of the 
global economy deepens. 
When the IIF was founded, EMEs made up a little more than 1/3 of global GDP.  Since the last Fed tightening 
cycle, their share of global activity has risen from around 45% to 60%.  By 2030, it is projected to rise to 
around three quarters.   
But while the real global economy is being reordered, the international monetary financial system has barely 
begun its transition.  The dollar represents the currency of choice for at least half of international trade 
invoices, two-thirds of global securities issuance, it denominates two-thirds of EME foreign currency external 
debt and acts as the monetary anchor in countries accounting for 70% of global GDP.14

    In fact, the dollar is as dominant today as it was during the Bretton Woods era, and is likely to remain so for 
some time, as its roles in international payments, as a reserve asset and a funding currency are mutually 
reinforcing. 15 
This means developments in the US have disproportionate influence on global economic and financial 
conditions.  Indeed, our research suggests that the influence of US financial conditions on foreign GDP has 
increased by a third relative to its average from 1990 to 2005, despite the US’s rapidly declining share of 
global GDP.

  When the Fed responds to domestic developments (such as a loosening in fiscal policy) global financial 
conditions and activity react strongly.  This was the case during both the 2013 ‘taper tantrum’ and over the 
past year, as Fed communications significantly shifted expectations for US monetary policy.  During both 
periods, Capital Flows-at-Risk in EMEs spiked (Chart 10).  
Financial (in)stability in advanced economies has also influenced the sustainability of capital flows to EMEs.  
During the 2008 global financial crisis, severely undercapitalised and liquidity-constrained banks in advanced 
economies severely contracted lending to emerging markets, global risk appetite deteriorated, investors 
everywhere retreated out of EMEs into ‘safe haven’ economies, and Capital Flows-at-Risk spiked sharply.  
Similar channels operated again three years later during the 2011 euro crisis (Chart 10). 
In total, push factors from AEs have weighed more heavily over the past decade, which has offset some of the 
improvement in ‘pull factors’, and shifted the distribution of capital flows back to the left (Chart 11).  Keeping 
one’s own house in order is necessary but not sufficient for sustainable capital flows in the new world order.16

 16 Some recent papers have proposed that the existence of a Global Financial Cycle has transformed the well-known international 
finance trilemma into a ‘dilemma’, according to which independent monetary policies are possible if and only if the capital account is 
managed, directly or indirectly (see Rey, H (2013), Dilemma not trilemma: the global financial cycle and monetary policy independence, 
in Global dimensions of unconventional monetary policy, proceedings of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Jackson Hole 
symposium, 2013, pp 285–333).  Other papers suggest the trilemma is still alive, but the process of trade and financial globalisation has 
worsened the trade-offs that domestic central banks face, raising the marginal value of macroprudential tools (see Obstfeld, M (2015), 
Trilemmas and Tradeoffs: Living with Financial Globalization," Central Banking, Analysis, and Economic Policies Book Series, in: 
Claudio Raddatz & Diego Saravia & Jaume Ventura (ed.), Global Liquidity, Spillovers to Emerging Markets and Policy Responses,

   Pipes 
This underscores the importance of the third driver of Capital Flows-at-Risk, the Pipes, or the structure of the 
global financial system itself.  
Since the crisis, “the pipes” have changed Capital Flows-at-Risk in at least three ways. 
First, over the past decade G20 reforms have made the core safer, simpler and fairer, which has reduced 
Capital Flows-at-Risk.  
Large global banks’ common equity requirements and buffers are ten times higher than the pre-crisis 
standard.  In keeping with new global liquidity standards, banks have changed their funding models and their 
liquid assets – relative to their liabilities that can readily run – are tenfold higher now than before the crisis.  
Regulation has also made banks less complex and more focused.  Trading assets have been cut in half, and 
interbank lending is down by one-third.  
Second, the growth in assets under management, from around $50 trillion a decade ago to over $80 trillion 
today, is bringing welcome diversity to the financial system, but is also increasing the risks of sudden stops 
and sharp capital reversals.  
Chart 12: Structure of external liabilities for emerging market economies  
Sources: IMF, EPFR and Bank of England calculations 
  For EMEs, market-based finance has accounted for all the increase in foreign lending since the crisis, as bank 
lending has declined and FDI has stayed fairly constant (Chart 12).

   Within market-based finance, investment funds are growing, accounting for the bulk of the growth in asset 
management over the last decade. 
In parallel, investment fund flows to EMEs now account for around one third of total portfolio flows, compared 
to around one tenth pre-crisis.  
These flows are particularly flighty (Chart 13), reflecting the fact that more than $30 trillion of global assets are 
held in investment funds that promise daily liquidity to investors despite investing in potentially illiquid 
underlying assets, such as EME debt.17  We have recently seen analogous situations in the UK within some 
niche managers and smaller markets, such as open-ended property funds investing in commercial real 
estate.18  The complications would be much greater if a major asset class like EME debt were to freeze up. 
This structural mismatch means that these funds can behave particularly pro-cyclically.  Bank of England work 
finds that redemptions by EME bond funds (those with larger structural mismatches) in response to price falls 
are five times those for EME equity funds (those with less structural mismatch).  In turn, EME equity funds are 
twice as responsive as AE equity funds. 
While the shift to market-based finance has increased global capital flows to EMEs, it also amplifies spikes in 
Capital Flows-at-Risk.  Moreover, market-based finance flows are particularly sensitive to push shocks, 
especially in extreme scenarios (Chart 13).  The recent global growth in assets under management has not 
yet been fully tested in an extreme scenario, such as a global downturn.

   The third aspect of the pipes is the global financial safety net (GFSN).  Developments in this regard have 
arguably further increased Capital Flows-at-Risk.  The GFSN has become more fragmented over the past two 
decades and its core – IMF resources – has shrunk relative to the size of the global financial system 
(Chart 14).  As a result, individual countries have chosen to self-insure at high cost to both themselves and 
the rest of the world.  
While the IMF’s nominal resources have more than tripled over the past decade, they still only represent 
around 1% of global gross external liabilities and have been on a downward trend from 2.5% in 1980.  Other 
multilateral arrangements, such as Regional Financing Arrangements (RFAs) and swap lines, are only partial 
substitutes.  RFAs are largely untested and swap lines may only be used in very specific situations between 
specific countries.  
There is no evidence the formal GFSN deters countries from holding reserves.19  The extra reserves that 
EMEs have accumulated over the past two decades have reduced the sensitivity of Capital Flows-at-Risk to 
Push factors by almost 50%.  But this extra insurance has come at a domestic high cost, both to finance and 
because reserves can crowd out domestic investment.20  And it has global externalities, with the vast 
accumulation of safe assets distorting yields, building global imbalances and increasing the risks of a global 
liquidity trap.21

Journal of International Money and Finance 94: 160–182. 
20 To limit the impact of FX reserve accumulation on the domestic money supply, most central banks sterilise their intervention through 
the issuance of bonds. The fiscal cost of FX reserve accumulation can be calculated as the difference between the interest paid on the 
sterilisation instrument and the interest received on FX reserve assets, which are typically low-yielding, low-risk foreign government 
bonds. The IMF estimated this wedge to be around 200 bps on average.  It can crowd out domestic investment as central bank 
sterilisation bonds compete for domestic savings. 
21 The increased demand for safe assets driven by this desire for safety – which Ben Bernanke christened a ‘savings glut’ – helped drive 
down the equilibrium interest rate, the interest rate central banks must deliver in order to balance demand with supply and so achieve 
stable inflation.

Capital Flows-at-Risk as a % of GDP

Notes: This chart shows estimates and projections for the sensitivity of Capital Flows-at-Risk to negative push shocks at 
different points in time. The chart is based on separate panel quantile regressions for FDI, banking, market-based finance 
and investment fund flows. We use the global FCI (push), country-specific FCIs (pull), and the share of NFC debt 
denominated in foreign currency as regressors. The third bar combines regression results with projections for the 
composition of flows and the role of FX-denominated debt in 2030, as described below and in footnote 21. The fourth bar 
also takes into account projected growth in EM’s external balance sheets as described below and in footnote 21. 
 In particular, we estimate that the growing shares of FX-denominated debt, market-based intermediation and, 
within that, the increasing role of investment funds, have increased the sensitivity of Capital Flows-at-Risk to 
push factors by 50% since the crisis (second bar, Chart 15) – largely using up the self-insurance purchased 
by EMEs. 
Left unattended, these vulnerabilities are likely to grow.  
If history serves as a guide to the evolution of EME balance sheets, EMEs’ external liabilities could double as 
a share of GDP by 2030: market-based finance could then account for half of external liabilities, up from one-
third today.  And if investment funds keep growing as they have over the past few years they could represent 
40% of market-based finance flows to EMEs in a decade’s time. 22 
 22 There is a systematic cross-country relationship between the size and composition of external balance sheets with levels of incomes per 
capita.  This has been combined with current forecasts (and for investment funds recent trends) to generate scenarios for the size and 
composition of EM balance sheets in 2030. In early stages of development a country’s cross-border finance tends to reflect trade finance 
provided by banks.  As global value chains develop FDI becomes more important.  Finally, market-based finance increases as financial

   These flows will benefit EMEs in good times, but if domestic institutional frameworks do not evolve in parallel, 
they could also be major sources of instability.  By 2030, the sensitivity of Capital Flows-at-Risk to push factors 
could triple (fourth bar, Chart 15).  
This would fully cancel out the positive impact of domestic reforms in EMEs over the past two decades: the 
shift left in the distribution when there is a push shock (grey distribution, Chart 16) is likely to be at least as 
great as the shift right that we have seen over the past two decades because of improvements in pull factors. 
While these calculations should be taken with a grain of salt, they suggest that in a new world order that 
combines growing market-based finance with a deepening asymmetry at the heart of the international 
monetary financial system, fast reforming EMEs could be running to stand still in their quest for higher 
sustainable capital flows.

   Policy Priorities  
This possibility underscores that everyone must contribute to building the sustainable capital flows we need. 
Emerging market economies should continue determined reform of domestic institutional frameworks to turn 
pull factors into insulators rather than amplifiers. 
Historically, countries have only benefited from financial openness once they reach a critical threshold of 
financial depth and institutional quality.23 
EMEs therefore need to reinforce the significant progress they have made on monetary policy credibility, 
including safeguarding central bank independence. 
Fiscal space will need to be used carefully given ongoing structural imperatives, the rising risks of global 
shocks, and the clear limits of monetary policy. 
To realise fully the benefits of financial openness EMEs need to reinforce banking system resilience and 
deepen their domestic capital markets, particularly to reduce reliance on foreign-denominated debt.24 
It will be particularly important for EMEs to continue to develop macroprudential policy toolkits to guard against 
excessive credit growth and high levels of indebtedness.  Tightening of prudential policy in EMEs dampens the 
spillover from US monetary policy tightening by around a quarter,25 and reduces Capital Flows-at-Risk 
(Chart 17).

Notes: Chart shows conditional distributions of capital flows to EMEs under an average macro-prudential stance and a 
one standard deviation tighter macro-prudential stance, as measured by Cerutti et al. (2014). The unconditional 
distribution differs from others in the speech given data on macro-prudential actions only starts in 2001 rather than in 
1996 as the rest of our data. See chart 5 and annex for further details. 
So many of the traditional imperatives for EMEs remain, but the Bank of England’s analysis shows that 
keeping one’s house in order won’t be sufficient, the neighbourhood too must change.26 
It is in the interest of advanced economies to moderate push factors. 
As EMEs have grown as a share of the global economy, so too have ‘spillbacks’ to advanced economies.  
The projected rise in capital flow volatility because of structural changes in the global financial system could 
take 1.2 percentage points off EME growth by 2030, all else equal.  Rising ‘spillbacks’ to advanced economies 
means growth there could also be at least 0.2 percentage points lower.27 
And while it is unrealistic to expect advanced economy policymakers to internalise fully spillovers from their 
actions on emerging markets, given their domestic mandates, AE monetary policies will increasingly need to 
take account of spillbacks. The spillover from a one standard deviation tightening in US financial conditions 
now reduces GDP for the average emerging market economy by around 0.2%, twice its 1990-2004 average.  
And the spillback from a 1% hit to EME GDP now drags on US activity by 0.15%, compared to 0.1% in 1990.  
                                                      
26 Some economists have called for monetary policy rules that constrain the actions of sending-country central banks under some 
circumstances, see Rajan, R (2019), Rising Tide, Finance and Development, June.  Certain kinds of unconventional monetary policy 
actions in specific environments could be ruled out of order because of the large adverse spillovers they create—much as sustained 
one-directional intervention in the exchange rate was frowned on until recently. In this view, adhering to such rules would not be a 
matter of altruism. Countries that have signed the IMF Articles of Agreement already accept responsibility for the international 
consequences of their actions. 
27 The impact on EME growth combines estimated higher volatility, derived from the Capital Flows-at-Risk model in the face of 
increasing sensitivity of capital flows to global factors, with the historical relationship between growth and volatility shown in Chart 2.  
The spillback to advanced economies is consistent with estimates in the following paragraph for the US.

   Taking the two together, spillbacks from a tightening in US financial conditions have tripled - accounting for 
around 6% of the impact of changes in US financial conditions on US GDP.  These effects will grow as 
financial integration continues. 
Continued transparency around monetary policy will also help EMEs to anticipate Capital Flows-at-Risk, and 
take pre-emptive actions where warranted. 
As long as there remains a fundamental asymmetry between the multi-polar global economy and dollar-
dominated international monetary financial system, absent other reforms EMEs may turn to Capital Flow 
Management (CFM) measures to safeguard financial stability in the face of push shocks. 
For example, limits on foreign currency borrowing and restrictions on the activities of open-ended investment 
funds could help EMEs to avoid dangerous build-up in volatile debt. 
But there are clear shortcomings to CFMs.  History has shown them to be addictive and often highly 
distortionary.  That is why the IMF’s Institutional View makes clear that CFMs should not substitute for 
domestic institutional reforms nor warranted macroeconomic adjustments. 
There are two major challenges in operationalising CFMs.  The first is proving intent so as not to provoke 
retaliation.  The second is that they can panic investors and make matters worse. 
A Capital Flows-at-Risk framework might help with these judgements.  If authorities can develop and agree a 
holistic approach it could inform policy actions, including the occasional disciplined use of Capital Flow 
Management tools in EMEs and the deployment of macroprudential measures in AEs. 
Indeed, policymakers in ‘push’ economies also have special responsibilities to manage risks in these global 
public goods.  This is especially the case for the Bank of England, given the City’s role as the world’s leading 
internationally active financial centre.  Recognising that the City is a global public good, we have transformed 
the resiliency of UK-based banks, we are well on the path to ending too-big-to-fail, and we have overhauled 
our liquidity facilities to support continuously open markets.28  We have simplified the complex and opaque 
web of OTC derivatives trade.  And we have convened market participants to develop new standards of 
market practice, such as the Global FX Code and the FMSB standards for FICC markets.  The UK’s Senior 
Managers Regime (SMR) gives teeth to voluntary codes by incentivising firms to embed them and by re-
establishing the link between seniority and accountability. 
The Bank’s findings suggest that the global macroprudential responsibilities of AEs will likely extend to the 
oversight of market-based finance given its potential for major cross-border spillovers.

  Reinforcing the best of resilient non-bank financial intermediation 
Over half of investment funds have a structural mismatch between the frequency with which they offer 
redemptions and the time it would take them to liquidate their assets.29  Under stress they may need to fire sell 
assets, magnifying market adjustments and triggering further redemptions – a vicious feedback loop that can 
ultimately disrupt market functioning.  
Two-thirds of investment funds with structural mismatches are domiciled in the US and Europe so, as is the 
case for banks, ensuring leverage and liquidity risks are managed in funds investing abroad is both a national 
asset and a global public good.  
System-wide stress simulations are currently being developed, including at the Bank of England, to assess 
these risks.30  And authorities are beginning to consider macroprudential policy tools to guard against the 
build-up of systemic risks in non-banks.  
Regulators currently have far less sight of risks within funds compared to the core banking system, particularly 
synthetic leverage arising from funds’ use of derivatives.  IOSCO is consulting on a set of metrics for 
measuring leverage.  To be most decision-useful, these need to be consistent and comprehensive across 
countries. 
The upcoming FSB-IOSCO evaluation of implementation and effectiveness of recommendations to address 
liquidity mismatch in funds will be crucial to improve our understanding of best practice, including the merits of 
adjustments to redemption periods to be more consistent with investments. 
We are mindful that these decisions could have global as well as local implications.  And we would welcome 
the IIF’s contributions to informing these judgements. 
The GFSN 
Better surveillance, a more resilient core of the financial system and a macroprudential approach to market-
based finance will all help increase sustainable capital flows, but they will be most effective if they are 
underpinned by an adequate GFSN. 
Pooling resources at the IMF is much more efficient than individual countries self-insuring against Capital 
Flows-at-Risk, distributing the costs across all 189 member countries.  To maintain reserve adequacy in the 
face of future larger and more risky external balance sheets, EMEs would need to double their current level of 
reserves over the next 10 years – an increase of $9 trillion.  A better alternative would be to hold $3 trillion in 
                                                      
29 Estimates are based on the FSB’s measure of ‘collective investment vehicles with features that make them susceptible to runs’, see 
FSB Global Monitoring Report on Non-Bank Financial Intermediation 2018.

   pooled resources, achieving the same level of insurance for a much lower cost.31  This would imply a tripling in 
the IMF’s resources over the next decade, enough to maintain their current share of global external liabilities. 32 
The design of the GFSN is also important.  Positive steps have been made in recent years by introducing 
precautionary liquidity facilities so countries can borrow to prevent crises, as well as mitigate their impact.  
This should also reduce stigma of drawing on the facilities.  But so far, only a few countries have taken them 
up.  It is important to do everything we can to normalise use of these precautionary facilities.33 
Conclusion 
In the deceptively simpler time of the pre-crisis world order, “keeping your house in order” was a handy 
prescription of the G7 to EMEs.  When countries were hit by volatile capital flows, they were admonished that 
there were “no innocent bystanders” and that only by doubling down on the Washington Consensus reforms 
could they be free to enjoy the benefits of sustainable cross-border investment.  
The experience of successive crises and shocks – confirmed by the Bank of England’s analysis – suggests 
that advice was once worthy but is increasingly incomplete.  The significant improvements in the institutional 
frameworks of EMEs are being offset by the deepening fundamental asymmetry in the international monetary 
financial system, the continued shrinking of the GFSN, and the rapid rise of market-based finance.  
Now there can be innocent bystanders: but there should be no disinterested observers.  
We are all responsible for addressing the fault lines in the global financial system and its safety net.  The IIF 
with its diverse and global membership can make a major contribution.  
In doing so we will reduce the volatility of capital flows, increase the sustainability of cross-border investment, 
and meet the great challenges of our age. 
                                                        
31 Since 1980 a maximum of 30% of EMs have concurrently been in an IMF programme, and since 1970 a maximum of 38% of EMs 
have experienced a crisis concurrently. 
32 This is based on projections of emerging market economies’ external balance sheets – see footnote 21. 
33 To date three countries, Colombia, Mexico, and Poland, have used the IMFs Flexible Credit Line.  While none of the three countries 
have so far drawn down on these lines, the FCL has provided a valuable backstop for these countries and helped boost market 
confidence during the period of heightened risks.

   Annex: Capital flows-at-risk 
The Bank’s capital flows-at-risk (KF@R) framework is based on the use of quantile regression methodology.  
It models the entire distribution of gross capital inflows to emerging market economies (EMs) based on a set 
of covariates, and focuses on the dynamics of the left tail of those conditional distributions, which is taken to 
be the relevant measure of capital flows-at-risk. 
In  the  baseline  specification,  the  distribution  of  capital  flows  is  estimated  conditional  on  proxies  for  “push” 
and “pull” factors.  For this purpose, the framework makes use of in-house financial conditions indices (FCIs), 
which measure co-movement in a series of financial indicators at the country level.34  The global average of 
these  indices  is  considered  to  be  a  summary  measure  of  “push”  factors,  and  the  residual  obtained  from 
regressing country indices on this global FCI to be a country-specific summary measure of “pull” factors.  
For different horizons (h) and quantiles (φ) of the distribution, a panel regression of capital flows is performed 
on a constant, and the proxies for push and pull factors:35  
KF@Ri,t+h,φ =   αt+h,φ +   βt+h,φ𝑃𝑢𝑠ℎt +   γt+h,φ𝑃𝑢𝑙𝑙i,t+h,φ +   εi,t+h,φ                 (1) 
This specification allows capital flows-at-risk to be estimated, which is measured as the 5th percentile of the 
distribution in the baseline case. This specification is estimated on quarterly gross-inflows from non-residents 
to a set of 13 EMs over the period 1996-2018.36  The specification is estimated separately for FDI, banking 
and  portfolio  flows,  and  a  split  of  portfolio  flows  into  those  intermediated  via  investment  funds  and  those 
which  are  not.    The  analysis  focuses  on  the  effect  of  push  and  pull  shocks  on  capital  flows  in  the 
contemporaneous quarter and the subsequent two quarters. 
In a second specification the role of a set of additional factors (X) in affecting the sensitivity of capital flows-
at-risk to global push shocks is considered.  This is done by adding an interactive effect to equation (1):37 
KF@R =   α +   β 𝑃𝑢𝑠ℎ + γ 𝑃𝑢𝑙𝑙 +   δ X +   θ (𝑃𝑢𝑠ℎ ∗ X) + 𝑢                         (2) 
A  series  of  factors  is  considered:  in  one  specification  the  focus  is  on  the  share  of  foreign  currency-
denominated  debt  and  a  measure  of  reserve  adequacy,  while  in  another  specification  the  role  of  macro-
prudential policy is analysed.   
                                                      
34 The FCI is the first principal component of the following series: long term government bond yields, term spreads, sovereign spreads, 
interbank  spreads,  corporate  spreads,  equity  returns,  equity  volatility  and  financials  market  capitalisation  (normalised  by  the  broader 
market). These indices are based on those presented by the IMF in their April 2017 GFSR. 
35 The main difference  between  this specification  and  the  one  proposed  by  the  IMF in their  October  2018  GFSR is  that  they consider 
capital flows in aggregate across EMs and, consequently, can only look at the effect of push factors. The choice to do this in a panel 
setting  with  country-specific  series  means  pull  factors  can  be  incorporated  into  the  analysis.  The  current  analysis  also  broadens  the 
scope from portfolio flows to different types of capital flows. 
36 The  EMs  considered  are  Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  Colombia,  Hungary,  India,  Indonesia,  Mexico,  Peru,  Philippines,  Russia,  South 
Africa and Turkey.  
37 Horizon and quantile subscripts are dropped here for simplicity.
