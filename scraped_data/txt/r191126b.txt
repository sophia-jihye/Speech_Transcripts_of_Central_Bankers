Building on the Gains from the Long Expansion 
Remarks by 
Jerome H. Powell 
Chair 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
at 
Annual Meeting of the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce 
Providence, Rhode Island 
November 25, 2019 
Over the past year, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC) have been conducting a first-ever public review of how we make monetary 
policy.  As part of that review, we held Fed Listens events around the country where 
representatives from a wide range of groups have been telling us how the economy is 
working for them and the people they represent and how the Federal Reserve might better 
promote the goals Congress has set for us:  maximum employment and price stability.  
We have heard two messages loud and clear.  First, as this expansion continues into its 
11th year—the longest in U.S. history—economic conditions are generally good.  
Second, the benefits of the long expansion are only now reaching many communities, and 
there is plenty of room to build on the impressive gains achieved so far.   
These themes show through in many ways in official statistics.  For example, 
more than a decade of steady advances has pushed the jobless rate near a 50-year low, 
where it has remained for well over a year.  But the wealth of middle-income families—
savings, home equity, and other assets—has only recently surpassed levels seen before 
the Great Recession, and the wealth of people with lower incomes, while growing, has 
yet to fully recover.1  
Fortunately, the outlook for further progress is good:  Forecasters are generally 
predicting continued growth, a strong job market, and inflation near 2 percent.  Tonight I 
will begin by discussing the Fed’s policy actions over the past year to support the 
favorable outlook.  Then I will turn to two important opportunities for further gains from

this expansion:  maintaining a stable and reliable pace of 2 percent inflation and 
spreading the benefits of employment more widely.   
Monetary Policy and the Economy in 2019 
We started 2019 with a favorable outlook, and over the year the outlook has 
changed only modestly in the eyes of many forecasters (figure 1).  For example, in the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters, the forecast for inflation is a bit lower, but the 
unemployment forecast is unchanged and the forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) 
is nearly unchanged.2  The key to the ongoing favorable outlook is household spending, 
which represents about 70 percent of the economy and continues to be strong, supported 
by the healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence.  
While events of the year have not much changed the outlook, the process of 
getting from there to here has been far from dull.  I will describe how we grappled with 
incoming information and made important monetary policy changes through the year to 
help keep the favorable outlook on track.   
As the year began, growth appeared robust, but the economy faced some risks 
flowing mainly from weakening global economic growth and trade developments.  
Foreign growth, which slipped in the second half of last year, slid further as 2019 
progressed.  While weaker foreign growth does not necessarily translate into similar 
weakness here, it does hurt our exporters and presents a risk that the weakness may 
spread more broadly.  At the same time, business contacts around the country have been 
telling us that trade-related uncertainties are weighing on their decisions.  These global 
developments have been holding back overall economic growth.  Manufacturing output,

similar change.

which had only recently surpassed its level before the Great Recession, has declined this 
year and is again below its pre-recession peak.  Business investment has also weakened.  
In addition, inflation pressures proved unexpectedly muted this year.  After 
remaining close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for much of last year, inflation is 
now running below 2 percent.  Some of the softness in overall inflation is the result of a 
fall in oil prices and should not affect inflation going forward.  But core inflation—which 
omits volatile food and energy prices—is also running somewhat below 2 percent.   
The main themes of our deliberations this year have been a continuing favorable 
outlook founded on strength in the household sector, with a few yellow flags including 
muted inflation and weakness in manufacturing.  In addition, global growth and trade 
have presented ongoing risks and uncertainties.  We also faced some less prominent 
factors that always confront policymakers.  Specifically, we never have a crystal clear 
real-time picture of how the economy is performing.  In addition, the precise timing and 
size of the effects of our policy decisions cannot be known in real time.  
In August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics previewed a likely revision to its count 
of payroll job creation for the 12 months ended March 2019.  The preview indicated that 
job gains over that period were about half a million lower than previously reported.  On a 
monthly basis, job gains were likely about 170,000 per month, rather than 210,000.  
While this news did not dramatically alter our outlook, it pointed to an economy with 
somewhat less momentum than we had thought.3   
3 The Fed’s real-time assessment of job growth this year is discussed in Jerome H. Powell (2019), “Data-
Dependent Monetary Policy in an Evolving Economy,” speech delivered at “Trucks and Terabytes:  
Integrating the ‘Old’ and ‘New’ Economies,” the 61st Annual Meeting of the National Association for 
Business Economics, Denver, Colorado, October 8,  
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191008a.htm.

Uncertainty about how our policies are affecting the economy also entered our 
discussions.  As you know, we set our policy interest rate to achieve our goals of 
maximum employment and stable prices.  In doing so, we often refer to certain 
benchmarks.  One of these is the interest rate that would be neutral—neither restraining 
the economy nor pushing it upward.  We call that rate “r*” (pronounced “r star”).  A 
policy rate above r* would tend to restrain economic activity, while a setting below r* 
would tend to speed up the economy.  A second benchmark is the natural rate of 
unemployment, which is the lowest rate of unemployment that would not create upward 
pressure on inflation.  We call that rate “u*” (pronounced “u star”).  You can think of r* 
and u* as two of the main stars by which we navigate.  In an ideal world, policymakers 
could rely on these stars like mariners before the advent of GPS.  But, unlike celestial 
stars on a clear night, we cannot directly observe these stars, and their values change in 
ways that are difficult to track in real time.  Standard estimates of r* and u* made by 
policymakers and other analysts have been falling since 2012 (figure 2).  Since the end of 
last year, incoming data—especially muted inflation data—prompted analysts inside and 
outside the Fed to again revise down their estimates of r* and u*.4  Taken at face value, a 
lower r* would suggest that monetary policy is providing somewhat less support for 
employment and inflation than previously believed, and the fall in u* would suggest that 
the labor market was less tight than believed.5  Both could help explain the weakness in 
                                                 
4 Averaging across the estimates in figure 2, the estimates of r* are down 0.3 percentage point and those of 
u* are down 0.2 percentage point. 
5 Taken literally, the revised estimates of the stars would, by standard rules of thumb, call for a somewhat 
lower federal funds rate.  For example, using the Taylor (1993) rule and using Okun’s law to state the rule 
in terms of the unemployment gap with a coefficient of 1 instead of the output gap with a coefficient of 0.5, 
the shift in r* and u* would call for a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate.  John B. Taylor 
(1993), “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public 
Policy, vol. 39 (December) (New York:  Elsevier), pp. 195–214.

inflation.  As with the revised jobs data, these revised estimates of the stars were not a 
game changer for policy, but they provided another reason why a somewhat lower setting 
of our policy interest rate might be appropriate. 
How did we add up all of these considerations?  To help keep the U.S. economy 
strong in the face of global developments and to provide some insurance against ongoing 
risks, we progressively eased the stance of monetary policy over the course of the year.  
First, we signaled that increases in our short-term interest rate were unlikely.  Then, from 
July to October, we reduced the target range for the federal funds rate by 3/4 percentage 
point.  The full effects of these monetary policy actions will be felt over time, but we 
believe they are already helping to support consumer and business sentiment and 
boosting spending in interest-sensitive sectors, such as housing and  consumer durable 
goods. 
We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as 
long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our 
outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 
symmetric 2 percent objective.  Looking ahead, we will be monitoring the effects of our 
policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the 
appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate.  Of course, if developments 
emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.  
Policy is not on a preset course. 
I will wrap up with two areas where we have an opportunity to build on our gains.  
 - 6 - 
A Sustained Return of Inflation to 2 percent 
For many years as the economy recovered from the Great Recession, inflation 
averaged around 1.5 percent—below our 2 percent objective (figure 3).  We had long 
expected that inflation would gradually rise as the expansion continued, and, as I noted, 
both overall and core inflation ran at rates consistent with our goal for much of 2018.  But 
this year, inflation is again running below 2 percent.   
It is reasonable to ask why inflation running somewhat below 2 percent is a big 
deal.  We have heard a lot about inflation at our Fed Listens events.  People are 
concerned about the rising cost of medical care, of housing, and of college, but nobody 
seems to be complaining about overall inflation running below 2 percent.  Even central 
bankers are not concerned about any particular minor fluctuation in inflation.   
Around the world, however, we have seen that inflation running persistently 
below target can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which inflation expectations drift down, 
pulling actual inflation further down.  Lower inflation can, in turn, pull interest rates to 
ever-lower levels.  The experience of Japan, and now the euro area, suggests that this 
dynamic is very difficult to reverse, and once under way, it can make it harder for a 
central bank to support its economy by further lowering interest rates.  That is why it is 
essential that we at the Fed use our tools to make sure that we do not permit an unhealthy 
downward drift in inflation expectations and inflation.  We are strongly committed to 
symmetrically and sustainably achieving our 2 percent inflation objective so that in 
making long-term plans, households and businesses can reasonably expect 2 percent 
inflation over time. 
 - 7 - 
Spreading the Benefits of Employment 
Many people at our Fed Listens events have told us that this long expansion is 
now benefiting low- and middle-income communities to a degree that has not been felt 
for many years.  We have heard about companies, communities, and schools working 
together to help employees build skills—and of employers working creatively to structure 
jobs so that employees can do their jobs while coping with the demands of family and life 
beyond the workplace.  We have heard that many people who in the past struggled to stay 
in the workforce are now working and adding new and better chapters to their lives.  
These stories show clearly in the job market data.  Employment gains have been broad 
based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of educational attainment as well 
as among people with disabilities (figure 4).   
The strong labor market is also encouraging more people in their prime working 
years—ages 25 to 54—to rejoin or remain in the labor force, meaning that they either 
have a job or are actively looking for one.  This is a welcome development.  For several 
decades up until the mid-1990s, the share of prime-age people in the labor force rose, as 
an influx of women more than offset some decline in male participation.  In the mid-
1990s, however, prime-age participation began to fall, and the drop-off became steeper in 
the Great Recession and the early years of the recovery (figure 5).  Between 2007 and 
2013, falling participation by both men and women contributed to a 2 percentage point 
overall decline.  Our falling participation rate stands out among advanced economies.  
While the United States was roughly in the middle of the pack among 32 economies as of 
1995, in 2018 we ranked near the bottom (figure 6).  Fortunately, in the strong job market 
since 2014, prime-age participation has been staging a comeback.  So far, we have made 
 - 8 - 
up more than half the loss in the Great Recession, which translates to almost 2 million 
more people in the labor force.  But prime age participation could be still higher.  
Income growth of low- and middle-income households has shown a pattern 
similar to that of participation, with two decades of disappointing news turning to better 
news during the past few years.  According to Census data, inflation-adjusted incomes for 
the lowest 20 percent of households declined slightly over the two decades through 2014, 
and income for the middle 20 percent rose only modestly.  Since then, incomes for these 
groups have risen more rapidly, as wage growth has picked up—and picked up most for 
the lower-paying jobs (figure 7).   
Recent years’ data paint a hopeful picture of more people in their prime years in 
the workforce and wages rising for low- and middle-income workers.  But as the people 
at our Fed Listens events emphasized, this is just a start:  There is still plenty of room for 
building on these gains.  The Fed can play a role in this effort by steadfastly pursuing our 
goals of maximum employment and price stability.  The research literature suggests a 
variety of policies, beyond the scope of monetary policy, that could spur further progress 
by better preparing people to meet the challenges of technological innovation and global 
competition and by supporting and rewarding labor force participation.6  These policies 
could bring immense benefits both to the lives of workers and families directly affected 
and to the strength of the economy overall.  Of course, the task of evaluating the costs 
and benefits of these policies falls to our elected representatives.

 Conclusion 
- 9 - 
Monetary policy is now well positioned to support a strong labor market and 
return inflation decisively to our symmetric 2 percent objective.  If the outlook changes 
materially, policy will change as well.  At this point in the long expansion, I see the glass 
as much more than half full.  With the right policies, we can fill it further, building on the 
gains so far and spreading the benefits more broadly to all Americans.
