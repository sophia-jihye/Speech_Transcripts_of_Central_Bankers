A Payments System for the Digital Economy
Philip Lowe
Governor
  Address to the 2019 Australian Payments Network Summit 
Sydney – 10 December 2019
Thank you for the invitation to address this year's Australian Payments Network Summit. This
summit has become an important fixture on the Australian payments calendar and this is the third
time I have had the privilege of joining you.
A recurring theme across these summits has been the need to improve customer outcomes. I am
very pleased to see that this focus has been continued at this year's summit. The focus on customer
outcomes aligns very closely with the focus of the Payments System Board. The Board wants to see
a payments system that is innovative, dynamic, secure, competitive, and that serves the needs of all
Australians.
Increasingly, this means that the payments system needs to support Australia's digital economy.
With the digital economy being an important key to Australia's future economic prosperity, we need
a payments system that is fit for purpose. We will only fully capitalise on the fantastic opportunities
out there if we have a payments system that works for the digital economy. The positive news is that
we have made some substantial progress in this direction over recent years and in some areas,
Australia's payments system is world class. However, in the fast-moving world of payments, things
don't stand still and there are some important areas we need to work on.
In my remarks today, I would like to do three things.
The first is to talk about some of the progress that has been made over recent years.
The second is to highlight a few areas where we would like to see more progress, particularly around
payments and the digital economy.
And third, I will highlight some of the questions we will explore in next year's review of retail
payments regulation in Australia.

Progress Is Being Made
Over recent years there have been significant changes in the way that we make payments. We now
have greater choice than ever before and payments are faster and more flexible than they used to
be.
The launch of the New Payments Platform – the NPP – in early 2018 has been an important part of
this journey. This new payments infrastructure allows consumers and businesses to make real-time, 
24/7 payments with richer data and simple addressing using PayIDs.
After the NPP was launched, it got off to a slow start, but it is now hitting its stride. Monthly
transaction values and volumes have both tripled over the past year (Graph 1). In November, the
platform processed an average of 1.1 million payments each day, worth about $1.1 billion. The rate
of take-up of fast retail payments in Australia is a little quicker than that in most other countries that
have also introduced fast payments (Graph 2).

I expect that we will see a further pickup in usage once the CBA has delivered on core NPP
functionality for all its customers. The slow implementation has been disappointing and we expect
the required functionality to be available soon.
There are now 86 entities connected to the NPP, including 74 that are indirectly connected via a
direct NPP participant. There are at least six non-ADI fintechs that are using the NPP's capabilities to
innovate and provide new services to customers. All up, approximately 66 million Australian bank
accounts are now able to make and receive NPP payments.
Use of the PayID service has also been growing, with around 3.8 million PayIDs having been
registered to date. If you have not already got a PayID, I encourage you to get one. I also
encourage you to ask for other people's PayIDs when making payments, as an alternative to asking
for their BSB and account number. It is much easier and faster.
One specific example of where the NPP is bringing direct benefits to people is its use by the
Australian Government, supported by the banking arm of the RBA, to make emergency payments.
During the current bushfires, the government has been able to use the NPP to make immediate
payments to people at a time when they are most in need, whether that be on the weekend or after
their bank has shut for the night.

One other area of the payments system where we have seen significant change is the take-up of
‘tap-and-go’ payments. Around 80 per cent of point-of-sale transactions are now ‘tap-and-go’, which
is a much higher share than in most other countries. This growth has been made possible by the
acquirers rolling out new technology in their terminals and by the willingness of Australians to try
something different. There has also been rapid take-up of mobile payments, including through
wearable devices.
Progress has also been made on improving the safety of electronic payments, particularly in relation
to fraud in card-not-present transactions. The rate of fraud is still too high, but it has come down
recently (Graph 3). I would like to acknowledge the work that AusPayNet has done here to develop a
new framework to tackle fraud. This framework strengthens the authentication requirements for
certain types of transactions, including through the use of multi-factor authentication.
help reduce card-not-present fraud and support the continued growth in online commerce.

As our electronic payments system continues to improve, we are seeing a further shift away from
cash and cheques. The RBA recently undertook the latest wave of our three-yearly consumer
payments survey. We are still processing the results, but ahead of publishing them early next year, I
thought I would show you the latest estimate on the use of cash (Graph 4). As expected, there has
https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-gov-2019-12-10.html

been a further trend decline in the use of cash, with cash now accounting for just around a quarter
of day-to-day transactions, and most of these are for small-value payments. Given the other
innovations that I just spoke about, I expect that this trend will continue.

Further Progress Needed
The progress across these various fronts means that there is a positive story to be told about
innovation in Australia's payments system.
At the same time, though, there are still some significant gaps and areas in our payments system
that need addressing and where progress would support the digital economy in Australia. I would
like to talk about four of these.
NPP
The first of these is further industry work to realise the full potential of the NPP, including its data-
rich capabilities.
The NPP infrastructure can help make electronic invoicing commonplace and help invoices be paid on
time. It can also support significant improvement in business processes, as more data moves with
the payment. Real-time settlement and posting of funds also enables some types of delivery-versus-
https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-gov-2019-12-10.html

payment, so that the seller can confirm receipt of funds and be confident in delivering goods or
services to the buyer.
A Payments System for the Digital Economy | Speeches | RBA
The layered architecture of the system was designed to promote competition and innovation in the
development of new overlay services. Notwithstanding this, one of the consequences of the slower-
than-promised rollout of the NPP by some of the major banks is that there has been less effort than
expected on developing innovative functionality. Payment systems are networks, and participants
need to know that others will be ready to receive payments and use the network. Some banks have
been reluctant to commit time and funding to support the development of new functionality given
that others have been slow to roll out their ‘day 1’ functionality. The slow rollout has also reduced
the incentive for fintechs and others to develop new ideas. So we have not yet benefited from the
full network effects.
The Payments System Board considered this issue as part of its industry consultation on NPP access
and functionality, conducted with the ACCC earlier this year. As part of that review we recommended
that NPPA – the industry-owned company formed to establish and operate the NPP – publish a
roadmap and timeline for the additional functionality that it has agreed to develop. The inaugural
roadmap was published in October and NPPA also introduced a ‘mandatory compliance framework’.
Under this compliance framework, NPPA can designate core capabilities that NPP participants must
support within a specified period of time, with penalties for non-compliance. This is a welcome
development.
One important element of the roadmap is the development of a ‘mandated payments service’ to
support recurring and ‘debit-like’ payments. This new service will allow account-holders to establish
and manage standing authorisations (or consents) for payments to be initiated from their account by
third parties. This will provide convenience, transparency and security for recurring or subscription-
type payments and a range of other payments.
Another element of the roadmap that has the potential to promote the digital economy is the
development of NPP message standards for payroll, tax, superannuation and e-invoicing payments.
The standards will define the specific data elements that must be included with these payment types,
which will support automation and straight-through processing. We would expect financial
institutions to be competing with each other to enable their customers to make and receive these
data-rich payments.
Less positively, there is still uncertainty about the future of the two remaining services that were
expected to be part of the initial suite of Osko overlay services. These are the ‘request-to-pay’ and
‘payment with document’ services. We understand there are still challenges in securing committed
project funding and priority from NPP participants to move ahead, even though BPAY has indicated it
is ready to complete the rollout. The RBA strongly supports the development of these additional NPP
capabilities, which are likely to deliver significant value for businesses and the broader community.
Digital identity
A second area where the Payments System Board would like to see further progress is the provision
of portable digital identity services that allow Australians to securely prove who they are in the digital
https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-gov-2019-12-10.html

environment.
A Payments System for the Digital Economy | Speeches | RBA
Today, our digital identity system is fragmented and siloed, which has resulted in a proliferation of
identity credentials and passwords. This gives rise to security vulnerabilities and creates significant
inconvenience and inefficiencies, which can undermine development of the digital economy. These
generate compliance risks and other costs for financial institutions, so it is strongly in their interests
to make progress here. It is fair to say that a number of other countries are well ahead of us in this
area.
The Australian Payments Council has recognised the importance of this issue and has developed the
‘TrustID’ framework. The Government's Digital Transformation Agency has also been working on a
complementary framework (the Trusted Digital Identity Framework), which specifies how digital
identity services will be used to access online government services. The challenge now is to build on
these frameworks and develop a strong digital identity ecosystem in Australia with competing but
interoperable digital identity services.
The rollout of open banking and the consumer data right should bring additional competition among
financial services providers, and digital identity is likely to reduce the scope for identity fraud, while
providing convenient authentication, as part of an open banking regime.
A strong digital identity system would also open up new areas of digital commerce and help reduce
online payments fraud. It will also help build trust in a wide range of online interactions. Building this
trust is increasingly important as people spend more of their time and money online. So we would
like to see some concrete solutions developed and adopted here.
Cross-border retail payments
A third area where we would like to see more progress is on reducing the cost of cross-border
payments.
For many people, the costs here are still too high and the payments are still too hard to make. It is
important that we address this. It is an issue not just for Australians, but for our neighbours as well.
I recently chaired a meeting of the Governors from the South Pacific central banks, where I heard
first-hand about the problems caused by the high cost of cross-border payments.
Analysis by the World Bank indicates that the price of sending money from Australia has been
consistently higher than the average price across the G20 countries (Graph 5). And a recent ACCC
inquiry found that prices for cross-border retail payment services are opaque. Customers are not
always aware of how the ‘retail’ exchange rate they are being quoted compares with the wholesale
exchange rate they see on the news, or of the final amount that will be received in foreign
currency.
 There are also sometimes add-on fees.

Graph 5
As part of the RBA's monitoring of the marketplace, our staff recently conducted a form of online
shadow shopping exercise, exploring the pricing of international money transfer services by both
banks and some of the new non-bank digital money transfer operators (MTOs).
This exercise showed that there is a very wide range of prices across providers and highlighted the
importance of shopping around.
The main results are summarised in this graph (Graph 6). In nearly every case, the major banks are
more expensive than the digital MTOs. For the major banks, the average mark-up over the wholesale
exchange rate is around 5½ per cent, versus about 1 per cent for the digital MTOs.

Graph 6
The graph illustrates why the cost of cross-border payments is such an issue for the South Pacific
countries. These costs are noticeably higher than for payments to most other countries. This is a
particular problem as many people in the South Pacific rely on receiving remittances from family and
friends in Australia and New Zealand. In many cases, low-income people are paying very high fees
and it is important that we address this where we can. As is evident from the graph, most digital
MTOs do not service the smaller South Pacific economies, which limits customers' choice of
providers.
In part, the high costs – and slow speed – of international money transfers is the result of
inefficiencies in the traditional correspondent banking process. It is understandable why some large
tech firms operating across borders see an opportunity here. Where people are being served poorly
by existing arrangements, new solutions are likely to emerge with new technologies. This represents
a challenge to the traditional financial institutions to offer better service at a lower cost to their
customers, while still meeting their AML/CTF requirements.
Central banks have a role to play here too, and there is an increased focus globally on what we can
do to reduce the cost of cross-border payments. One example of this is the promotion of

standardised and richer payment messaging globally through the adoption of the ISO20022
standard. The RBA is also working closely with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, AUSTRAC and
other South Pacific central banks to develop a regional framework to address the Know-Your-
Customer concerns that have limited competition and kept prices high.
Operational resilience
A fourth area where we would like to see more progress is improving the operational resilience of the
electronic payments system.
[4]
Disruptions to retail payments hurt both consumers and businesses. Given that many people now
carry little or no cash, the reliability of electronic payment services has become critical to the smooth
functioning of our economy.
We understand that, given the complexity of IT systems, some level of payments incidents and
outages to services is inevitable. But it is apparent from the data we have that the frequency and
duration of retail payments outages have risen sharply in recent years. In response, the RBA has
begun working with APRA and the industry to enhance the data on retail payment service outages
and to introduce a suitable disclosure framework for these data. These measures will provide greater
transparency around the reliability of services and allow institutions to better benchmark their
operational performance.
The 2020 Review of Retail Payments Regulation
The third and final issue I would like to touch on is the Payments System Board's review of retail
payments regulation next year.
The review is intended to be wide-ranging and to cover all aspects of the retail payments landscape,
not just the RBA's existing cards regulation. As the first step in the process, we released an Issues
Paper a couple of weeks ago and have asked for submissions by 31 January.
 There will also be
opportunities to meet with RBA staff conducting the review.
[5]
The review will cover a lot of ground, including hopefully some of the issues that I just mentioned.
There are, though, a few other questions I would like to highlight.
The first is what can be done to reduce further the cost of electronic payments?
Both the Productivity Commission and the Black Economy Taskforce have called for us to examine
this question. It is understandable why. As we move to a predominantly electronic world, the cost of
electronic payments becomes a bigger issue. The Payments System Board's regulation of interchange
fees and the surcharging framework, as well as its efforts to promote competition and encourage
least-cost routing, have all helped lower payment costs.
At issue is how we make further progress: what combination of regulation and market forces will
best deliver this? Relevant questions here include: whether interchange fees should be lowered
further; how best to ensure that merchants can choose the payment rails that give them the best
https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-gov-2019-12-10.html
10/12

value for money; and whether restrictions relating to no-surcharge rules should be applied to other
arrangements, including the buy-now-pay-later schemes.
A Payments System for the Digital Economy | Speeches | RBA
A second issue is what is the future of the cheque system?
Cheque use in Australia has been in sharp decline for some time. Over the past year, the number of
cheques written has fallen by another 19 per cent and the value of cheques written has fallen by
more than 30 per cent, as the real estate industry has continued to shift to electronic property
settlements (Graph 7). At some point it will be appropriate to wind up the cheque system, and that
point is getting closer. Before this happens, though, it is important that alternative payment methods
are available for those who rely on cheques. Using the NPP infrastructure for new payment solutions
is likely to help here.
Graph 7
Third, is there a case for some rationalisation of Australia's three domestically focused payment
schemes, namely BPAY, eftpos and NPPA? A number of industry participants have indicated to us
that they face significant and sometimes conflicting investment demands from the three different
entities. This raises the question of whether some consolidation or some form of coordination of
investment priorities might be in the public interest.
Fourth, and finally, what are the implications for the regulatory framework of technology changes,
new entrants and new business models?
https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-gov-2019-12-10.html
11/12
A Payments System for the Digital Economy | Speeches | RBA
10/12/2019
The world of payments is moving quickly, with new technologies and new players offering solutions
to longstanding problems. At the same time, expectations regarding security, resilience, functionality
and privacy are continually rising. Meeting these expectations can be challenging, but doing so is
critical to building and maintaining the trust that lies at the heart of effective payment systems. The
entry of non-financial firms into the payments market also raises new regulatory issues. As part of
the review, it would be good to hear how the regulatory system can best encourage a dynamic and
innovative payments system in Australia that fully serves the needs of its customers.
So these are some of the many issues on our agenda. We are looking forward to receiving your
input. For now, thank you for listening and I am happy to answer your questions.
Thank you.

For example, bank customers may also incur additional fees charged by the ‘correspondent banks’ that intermediate
the payment to its final destination on behalf of the sending bank. These fees may not be known at the point of the
transaction and can result in less foreign currency being received than expected.
