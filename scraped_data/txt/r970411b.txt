Mr.  Bäckström  discusses  monetary  policy  and  unemployment  in  Sweden
Speech  by  the  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Sweden,  Mr.  Urban  Bäckström,  before  the  Swedish
Economics Association on 6/3/97.
First a word of thanks for the invitation to  this  evening’s  discussion.  This  is  the
third year in succession that  your  Association’s  agenda  has  featured  monetary  policy.  My  first
introductory talk, in 1995, was about the importance of low inflation and the background to and
implications  of  focusing  on  price  stability.  Last  year  I  took  up  matters  to  do  with  monetary
policy’s  construction  and  effects,  as  well  as  the  considerations  behind  the  monetary  policy
decisions in recent years. This evening I shall be elaborating on those discussions and then deal
with monetary policy in the context of Sweden’s high unemployment.
Economic developments in Sweden
Following the deep recession in the Swedish economy in the early 1990s, we are
now in the fourth year of economic expansion. Since 1994 production’s annual growth rate has
averaged 2.8 per cent, which is considerably above the trend to which we have been accustomed
in recent decades.
In  1994  and  1995  the  GDP  growth  rate  averaged  as  much  as  3.5  per  cent.  This
increase was concentrated on the internationally oriented sector and industrial activity registered
the  fastest  upswing  in  a  long  time.  This  led  to  capacity  problems  despite  relatively  high
investment  growth.  The  strong  expansion  was  therefore  not  sustainable.  Moreover,  the
credibility  of  economic  policy  was  impaired  by  weak  central  government  finance  and  an
unfavourable  history  of  inflation.  There  was  a  lack  of  confidence  that  the  expansionary  trend
could continue without generating higher inflation. Inflation expectations  moved  up--more  and
more people began to count on  rising inflation. All this was manifested in, for example, rising
long-term  interest  rates,  a  weak  exchange  rate,  rising  producer  prices  and  accelerating  wage
increases.
The Riksbank therefore tightened interest rate policy, beginning in August 1994.
The  restrictive  turn  was  criticised  in  some  quarters  because  inflation  had  not  yet  started  to
accelerate. But our intention was precisely that. If monetary policy measures are taken in time,
the  inflationary  process  can  be  checked  before  it  has  taken  off.  Once  inflation  has  got  going,
more pronounced monetary policy measures are needed for a return to low inflation.
Vigorous  efforts  have  also  been  made  over  these  years  to  tackle  the  central
government financial deficit. With its six-monthly control stations, the convergence programme
enables  people  to  keep  an  eye  on  the  political  system’s  determination  to  complete  the
consolidation of the budget and fulfil the goal of balance  in  1998.  Government  representatives
have also expressed an ambition to achieve a surplus after that. With the improvement in central
government finance, confidence in economic policy grew appreciably and inflation expectations
fell  back  notably  in  the  autumn  of  1995  and  during  1996.  This  in  turn  is  a  fundamental
prerequisite for lastingly stable growth.  During  1996  the  Riksbank  was  in  a  position  to  reduce
the repo rate by degrees to the lowest level for more than thirty years.
Towards  the  end  of  1995  the  growth  of  production  slackened  and  the  increase
during 1996 probably stopped at between 1 and 1.5 per cent. However, the slowdown seems to
have  been  relatively  gentle.  The  demand  situation  appears  to  be  good,  particularly  when  one
BIS Review   38/1997

considers  that  the  growth  of  private  sector  production  was  held  back  by  marked  destocking  in
1996.  Stock  adjustments  are  not  uncommon  after  some  years  of  rising  output  and  they  do  not
seem  to  have  had  negative  effects  on  private  consumption.  In  the  second  half  of  1996  private
consumption picked up and export demand went on rising. As the destocking comes to an end,
domestic and international demand should therefore be able to generate an accelerating growth
of production this year and in 1988.
Considering  the  economy’s  unutilised  resources,  I  do  not  expect  inflationary
capacity restrictions to arise in the coming years. If inflation expectations also remain  low  and
confidence  in  economic  policy  in  general  is  stable,  this,  too,  will  contribute  to  a  subdued
development of future inflation.
Since  the  autumn  there  have  been  some  months  in  which  the  level  of  consumer
prices was lower than a year earlier. In a price analysis, however, it is important to distinguish
transitory effects on inflation from the underlying inflationary process. In January this year the
level of consumer prices was 0.1 per cent lower than a year earlier. Strictly speaking, however,
what  Sweden  is  experiencing  is  not  deflation.  The  falling  price  level  has  to  do  with  transitory
effects,  above  all  the  Riksbank’s  marked  reduction  of  the  repo  rate  during  1996.  Excluding
house mortgage interest costs, the rate of inflation in January 1997 was about 1.5 per cent.
The  outlook  for  inflation  points  to  room  for  a  fall  in  bond  rates.  Moreover,
underlying  economic  factors  suggest  that,  after  the  depreciation  in  recent  months,  the  krona  is
undervalued and should be capable of appreciating.
The present monetary stance appears to be well balanced. After the major changes
in  the  past  year,  for  example  in  the  repo  rate,  time  is  needed  to  assess  their  effects.  Another
matter to consider is the recent months’ developments in financial markets. They, too, call for a
cautious line in monetary policy.
I note that the Swedish economy seems to have made good progress in adjusting
to a low inflation regime, with stable, sustained growth. What gives cause for concern, however,
is that the recovery of employment appears to be much more sluggish and that unemployment is
persistently high.
High cost of unemployment
As shown in Diagram 1, registered unemployment in Sweden rose sharply in the
early  1990s;  from  a  level  between  2  and  3  per  cent,  it  shot  up  to  around  8  per  cent.  This  was
accompanied  by  increased  participation  in  labour  market  programmes.  Total  unemployment
accordingly reached around 13 per cent, an increase of almost 10 percentage points or up to half
a  million  people.  This  is  the  highest  level  since  the  1930s.  It  is  primarily  among  youth  that
unemployment is high, as shown in Diagram 2. Sweden seems to have landed in much the same
situation as many other countries in Europe.
High unemployment is associated with grave social problems and large economic
costs.  Unemployment’s  long-run  economic  costs  in  terms  of  GDP  can  be  said  to  be  of

approximately  the  same  magnitude  as  the  unemployment  rate.1  Sweden’s  increase  in
unemployment can in this way be estimated to cost around 10 per cent of GDP a year, which is
equivalent  to  SKr  150  billion.  Considering  the  sensitivity  of  general  government  finance  to
variations in unemployment and production, the cost to the public sector, in the  form  of  lower

tax revenue and increased expenditure on unemployment support, for example, may actually be
as high as 9 per cent of GDP or SKr 135 billion.2
Conversely,  an  appreciable  reduction  of  unemployment  implies  decreased  social
tensions  as  well  as  substantial  economic  gains.  Calculated  in  the  same  way,  halving  registered
unemployment from 8 to 4 per cent, for example, would confer an estimated long-term gain in
production  of  4  per  cent  of  GDP  and  strengthen  government  finance  by  as  much  as  over
SKr 50 billion a year.
Simple  calculations  of  this  type  are  obviously  uncertain  but  they  do  serve  to
illustrate  the  sort  of  economic  benefits  that  may  be  reaped  from  an  appreciable  fall  in
unemployment.
What can the Riksbank and monetary policy do?
There  was  a  time  when  many  people  believed  that  the  problem  of  very  high
unemployment could be tackled with a generally expansionary economic policy. Lower interest
rates,  devaluations  or  fiscal  stimuli  were  seen  as  instruments  for  boosting  demand,  raising
production, improving employment and thereby lowering unemployment. Even today, advocates
of  similar  views  are  not  uncommon.  As  the  consolidation  of  the  budget  places  constraints  on
fiscal policy, attention concentrates on monetary  policy.  Representatives  of  this  line  argue  that
the problem of unemployment could be solved if only the Riksbank had a wider objective than
combating inflation. Some say that the Riksbank ought therefore also to have explicit goals for
growth, employment and unemployment, goals that should be as important as keeping inflation
under control.
You will hardly be surprised to hear that I do not share such opinions. The current
situation in the labour market is more complicated than that.
An  expansionary  economic  policy,  aimed  at  boosting  demand  above  the
economy’s long-term production potential, would actually be liable to worsen the labour market
situation in the longer run. Inflation would move up and the economy would function less well.
Neither is it the case that higher inflation would generate permanently  higher  employment  and
lastingly lower unemployment. Let me give you an example.
Suppose  inflation  is  2  per  cent  initially  and  monetary  policy  is  given  an
expansionary turn that disregards the sustainable level of output. If wage agreements have been
concluded for a considerable period, an upward shift in inflation to, say, 5 per cent could in the
best  case  contribute  to  a  short-run  increase  in  employment  because  firms’  real  wage  costs  are
reduced. In time, however, 5 per cent inflation will be perceived as normal and wage demands
will be pitched accordingly. With higher nominal wage increases, real wage costs will rise again
and  unemployment  will  tend  to  return  to  its  initial  level.  A  renewed  attempt  to  stimulate
employment and reduce unemployment would then entail a further acceleration of inflation from
5  to,  say,  8  per  cent  and  the  procedure  would  be  repeated.  Ultimately,  all  that  is  achieved  is
higher average inflation and an economy than functions less efficiently; unemployment stays at
its initial level.

The  level  of  unemployment  to  which  an  economy  returns  when  inflation
expectations  have  been  adjusted  to  actual  inflation  is  usually  referred  to  as  equilibrium
unemployment. It is immune to monetary policy and determined primarily by structural factors
such as demographic changes, technology and the institutional conditions in the labour market.
What I have just described is the textbook model for the long-term Phillips curve.
The  message  is  that  an  economy  has  a  path  for  long-term  growth  that  is
determined  by  underlying,  structural  factors.  Under  certain  circumstances,  fiscal  and  monetary
policy  are  capable  of  influencing  fluctuations  in  activity  around  this  trend,  though  one  should
not  expect  to  be  able  to  fine-tune  demand.  A  basic  idea  behind  a  monetary  policy  focused  on
price stability is that  the  economy  is  capable  of  sustained  growth  along  this  long-term  path.  If
this  path  accommodates  a  rapid  increase  in  production,  growth  will  be  high;  but  if  potential
output  rises  slowly,  actual  growth  will  be  weak  even  if  monetary  policy  were  to  be  very
expansionary and possibly affect the situation temporarily.
A  very  important  conclusion  from  this  is  that  permanently  low  unemployment
cannot  be  achieved  by  accepting  permanently  high  inflation.  In  other  words,  sustained
employment  cannot  be  generated  by  implementing  an  expansionary  monetary  policy  and
disregarding  unemployment’s  equilibrium  level  or  the  potential  level  of  output.  The  narrower
the  gap  between  actual  production  and  the  capacity  ceiling  and  the  lower  unemployment
happens to be in relation to its equilibrium level, the greater will be the risk of higher inflation.
From  this  also  follows  a  need  to  know  whether  the  equilibrium  level  of
unemployment has risen. If that is the case, measures should be taken specifically to lower the
equilibrium level, a task that is outside the scope of monetary policy.
Where is unemployment’s equilibrium level?
What  is  unemployment’s  current  equilibrium  level  in  Sweden?  As  always  when
one  goes  from  a  theoretical  analysis  to  practical  economics,  everything  becomes  much  more
complex. Unemployment’s equilibrium level is not an observable quantity. One has to make do
with estimates and their inevitable uncertainty means that interpretations have to be cautious.
The available estimates suggest that equilibrium unemployment in Sweden moved
up  in  the  early  1990s  and,  in  terms  of  registered  unemployment,  is  now  somewhere  in  the
interval  between  4.5  and  7.5  per  cent.3  The  OECD  also  counts  on  a  marked  increase  in  the
1990s; in the latest report on Sweden the current level is put at between 6 and 7 per cent.4
There  is  not,  in  fact,  complete  agreement  that  equilibrium  unemployment  has
moved  up  sharply.5  But  what  suggests  that  it  has,  even  though  we  cannot  be  sure  of  its  exact
level, is that otherwise the high unemployment should have acted as a strong restraint on wage
formation. The actual development of wages does not indicate this.

It  therefore  has  to  be  concluded  that  unemployment  cannot  be  lowered
appreciably  by  monetary  policy  alone.  Most  economic  observers  also  consider  that  even  with
decent  growth  in  the  coming  years,  unemployment  will  remain  high.  A  lasting  return  just  to
something  resembling  the  unemployment  figures  we  have  been  accustomed  to  in  Sweden
therefore  requires  a  proper  discussion  of  which  measures  are  needed  to  bring  equilibrium
unemployment down.
The picture in the USA, Western Europe and Sweden
It  is  not  just  in  Sweden  that  unemployment  is  high.  This  is  something  which  is
leaving  its  mark  on  virtually  the  whole  of  the  EU  area.  Moreover,  the  level  of  European
unemployment has been high during most of the 1980s. In the United States, on the other hand,
unemployment has fluctuated around 6 per cent for the past quarter century without any upward
trend.
The  direct  explanation  for  the  difference  between  the  EU  area  and  the  United
States is the appreciably faster growth of employment over there. In the past quarter century and
more, employment in the United States has risen over 60 per cent as against only 15 per cent in
the  EU  area.  The  number  of  new  jobs  certainly  grew  by  some  one  per  cent  in  Europe  when
activity  was  recovering  but  almost  as  many  jobs  disappeared  in  the  downturns.  In  the  United
States, on the other hand, over the business cycle there have been net increases.
Economists differ as to the underlying causes. For some economists, equilibrium
unemployment has moved up on  account  of  underlying structural  factors.  One  hypothesis,  put
forward by, among others, the American economist Paul Krugman, is that certain categories of
labour (low educated, for example) are having increasing difficulty  in  competing  in  the  labour
market.6 This is mainly bound up with a technology that replaces manual labour with machines
but presumably it also has  to  do  with  increased  competition  from  countries  where  wage  levels
are considerably lower. It is often pointed out that the  effects  of  this  are  countered  by  a  wider
wage spread that in turn has stimulated an expansion of the private services sector. Employment
has therefore risen rapidly in the United States. In Europe, on the other hand, the result has been
increased  unemployment;  the  labour  market  and  wage  formation  here  have  not  permitted  the
same development as in the United States.
A similar effect, leading to a stronger employment trend, may have come from a
lower average real  wage  rise  in  the  United  States  compared  with  Europe.  The  steep  real  wage
increase  in  the  EU  area  has  favoured  capital-intensive  sectors  and  stimulated  the  use  of
capital-intensive  technology.  At  the  same  time,  low-productivity  enterprises  have  shrunk  or
closed down. This has shown up in increased productivity and weakly rising employment. The
opposite  has  occurred  in  the  United  States:  sluggish  real  wages  have  limited  the  need  to
rationalise labour and invest in capital-intensive equipment and this has resulted in rapidly rising
employment.7

As shown in Diagram 3a, since 1970 the average real wage in the United States
has risen by a total of 15 per cent but by as much as 60 per cent in the EU area. The change in
employment, as I mentioned earlier, has been the opposite.

Europe,  however,  does  have  some  positive  examples.  One  of  the  few  countries
here  that  has  managed  to  turn  the  employment  curve  upwards  from  the  mid-1980s  is  the
Netherlands,  as  shown  in  Diagram  3b.  In  the  course  of  a  decade  unemployment  has  been
virtually halved, from 12 to just over 6 per cent. One factor behind this is a very moderate real
wage  rise,  so  that  employment  has  risen  on  this  account.  The  labour  market  has  probably
become  more  adaptable.  Another  phenomenon  in  the  Netherlands  is  an  increase  in  part-time
employment;  this  probably  reflects  a  change  in  labour  demand  but  also  a  shift  in  supply.  The
case of the Netherlands shows that the employment trend can be turned.
This  indicates,  in  my  opinion,  that  in  the  current  discussion  in  Sweden  about  a
new model for wage formation, the prototype ought not to be Europe as a whole. If the average
real wage rise in Sweden were to match the rate observed in Europe in the past quarter-century,
it  might  make  a  reduction  of  unemployment  more  difficult.  The  model  should  rather  be  the
Netherlands.
The pattern in Sweden resembles  that  for  the  EU  area.  In  the  period  as  a  whole
employment  has  hardly  changed.  As  in  Europe  in  general,  real  wages  have  risen  relatively
strongly, though the trend has been held back  by  a  series  of  devaluations  that  pushed  inflation
up, presumably with a negative effect on production.

The  great  challenge  Sweden  faces  in  the  future  development  of  employment  is
evident  from  Diagram  4,  which  shows  that  for  a  long  time  there  has  been  no  net  increase  in
private sector jobs. This is the trend that must be broken. While there has  certainly  been  some
increase in employment in boom years, in the subsequent downturns virtually as many jobs have

disappeared. The overall increase in employment has come from an expansion of public sector
jobs; one million jobs were created in this sector between 1960 and 1990. Now that, for various
reasons,  the  political  system  has  been  obliged  to  arrest  the  public  sector’s  expansion,
employment has also fallen.

It is important, I think, to underscore that, notwithstanding the marked differences
in  employment,  GDP  growth  does  not  differ  substantially  between  the  United  States,  the  EU
area,  the  Netherlands  and  Sweden.  Therefore  it  is  not  high  demand  generated  by  a  more
expansionary monetary and fiscal policy that can account for the creation of so many new jobs
in  the  United  States  or,  in  the  past  decade,  in  the  Netherlands.  This  is  an  indication  that
structural factors lie behind the development in Western Europe as a whole. An important part
seems to be played, not least, by wage formation.
The  weak  growth  in  Sweden  is  also  evident  from  Diagram  5.  This  is  another
interesting observation in the present context. When potential output rises slowly  for  structural
reasons, growth will be weak even if economic policy is expansionary. In spite of devaluations
and fiscal expansion with a view to boosting demand, growth has remained lower than in many
other  industrialised  countries.  This  is  an  important  lesson  to  bear  in  mind  when  discussing
monetary policy’s functions and tasks.
Other  economists  have  been  less  interested  in  why  employment  has  been  slack
and unemployment has risen and more concerned with unemployment’s tendency to remain at a
high  level.  The  observation  that  unemployment,  having  risen,  tends  to  stick  at  a  high  level  or
falls  back  to  normal  levels  only  gradually  is  usually  described  in  terms  of  hysteresis  and

persistence.8  An  explanation  for  the  occurrence  of  persistence  tendencies  is  provided  by  the
insider-outsider  model.  Briefly,  an  increase  in  unemployment  does  not  lead  to  wage  restraint
because  those  who  have  lost  the  jobs--the  outsiders--exercise  no  influence  on  wage  setting.
Instead  of  a  restrained  wage  rise,  with  lower  labour  costs  and  a  possibility  of  taking  on
additional labour, the wage increases remain high and the outsiders remain out of work.9 Strictly
speaking, this does not constitute an increase in equilibrium unemployment but it still amounts
to unemployment that is more or less permanent.
In Sweden, wage increases tended to accelerate in the 1995 round of settlements
even  though  unemployment  was  high.  Statements  by  representatives  of  labour  market
organisations  are  indicative  of  a  propensity  to  give  real  wage  increases  priority  over  increased
employment. Allow me to cite (from Finanstidningen, 14th October 1996): “There is no direct
link  between  our  coming  wage  claims  and  the  number  who  are  unemployed”.  This  is  an
illustration of the theories about insiders and outsiders in the labour market.
The  costs  of  hiring  and  firing  labour  are  one  source  of  insiders’  influence  over
wage  formation,  which  can  affect  the  possibility  of  bringing  unemployment  down.  During  the
latest  economic  upswing  in  Sweden  the  number  of  hours  worked  rose  by  the  equivalent  of
130,000 new jobs but the increase in the number of persons in employment stopped at 85,000.
The  direct  explanation  is  that  average  working  time  lengthened,  which  naturally  may  have
reflected a rising propensity to go from part-time to full-time work and to do overtime in order
to ease a strained personal economy. But it is also conceivable that employers have become less
inclined to hire additional labour and more prone to make greater use of the existing labour force
to cope with rising demand. An indication of this could be employers’ willingness to introduce
working hours related to the activity in the economy.
The differences between the explanatory models should not be exaggerated. They
have  several  features  in  common  and  this  makes  them  difficult  to  separate  clearly  in  practice.
Most  of  the  evidence  suggests  that  the  high  equilibrium  unemployment  in  Western  Europe  as
well  as  in  Sweden  has  several  causes.  As  the  structures  and  institutions  in  the  Swedish  labour
market  resemble  those  in  the  rest  of  Western  Europe  in  many  respects,  it  is  reasonable  to
suppose  that  the  same  forces  have  been  at  work  in  our  country  but  that  their  impact  and
importance  were  concealed  for  a  long  time  by  an  expansionary  economic  policy  that  was
ultimately unsustainable.
High  and  more  or 
less  permanent  unemployment,  or  high  equilibrium
unemployment, is a sign that the labour market is functioning poorly. These problems are rooted
in  turn  in  wage  developments  because  it  is  price  formation  which  is  the  central  market
mechanism.
Conclusion
The  best  way  in  which  monetary  policy  can  contribute  to  an  economy  that
functions better economy with employment and growth is by keeping  inflation  low  and  stable.

The  economy  can  then  expand  along  its  long-term  growth  trend.  If  this  path,  which  is
determined by structural factors, permits a rapid increase in output, growth will then be high. If
potential output rises slowly, on the other hand, economic growth will be weak even if monetary
policy were to be very expansionary.
Most  things  suggest  that  traditional  demand  policy  is  not  capable  of  lowering
unemployment appreciably. Most economic observers also expect that even with decent growth,
unemployment will remain high in the coming years.
Whatever the causes of the high unemployment, an important key to turning this
tendency lies in the functioning of the labour market. I have not considered conceivable specific
measures,  such  as  stimulating  private  sector  employment,  contributing  to  efficient  wage
formation  and  encouraging  individuals  to  look  for  and  accept  jobs  and  maintain  and  develop
their  competence.  I  believe  that,  as  Assar  Lindbeck  pointed  out  recently,10  the  problem  of
unemployment in Sweden and, indeed, in the whole of Western  Europe  has  to  do  with  a  great
many factors connected with how the labour market functions.
Although the most effective measures cannot be identified for certain in advance,
the  central  concern  is  the  workings  of  the  labour  market  and  thereby  also  the  labour  market
organisations. This applies to employer and  employee  representatives  alike.  The  climate  in  the
labour  market  will  be  of  significance  for  the  possibility  of  bringing  the  high  unemployment
down.
One  issue  is  whether  a  mood  of  mutual  understanding  can  be  created  so  that
employment  has  priority  in  wage  setting.  An  important  lesson  seems  to  be  that  Sweden  ought
not to opt for a standard in wage formation that matches the average level in  Western  Europe;
such a relatively high level could impede a reduction of unemployment. The model should rather
be the Netherlands.
Another  issue  is  whether  a  mood  of  mutual  understanding  can  be  created  about
the reform and construction of labour market rules  and  other  measures  that  can  help  to  reduce
unemployment.
My intention this evening has not been to present a deeper analysis of the labour
market  problems,  nor  to  answer  questions  about  what  needs  to  be  done.  But  perhaps  I  have
contributed  by  raising  some  of  the  questions  that  need  to  be  answered  and  by  defining  the
function  of  monetary  policy  and  what  it  can  do.  If  we  are  to  achieve  a  lasting  return  just  to
something resembling the unemployment figures we have been accustomed to in Sweden, there
will have to be a proper discussion of which measures are needed to bring unemployment down.
