Mr. Grenville focuses on international capital flows and crises
Talk by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr. Stephen Grenville, to Credit
Suisse  First  Boston  Australia  Conference  entitled,  “The  Global  Financial  System  –  The  Risks  of
Closure” in Sydney on 13/11/98 (excluding bibliography).
There are many things that went wrong for the countries caught up in the Asian crisis of 1997, but
out of the myriad causes, two clear central problems can be identified: the fatal combination of large
and volatile international capital flows, interacting with fragile domestic financial sectors. Today, I
want to focus on the first of these issues: international capital flows.
International  flows  are  now  centre-stage  in  the  international  economic  policy  debate.  This  is
certainly a higher profile than capital flows usually have. Traditionally, the focus has been on the
real sector counterparts of these: the savings/investment balance and the current account surpluses
and deficits. Both theory and practical policymaking often assume that these are the “movers” of the
action, with capital flows largely a passive, accommodating residual. But the Asian crisis suggests
that  the  action  may,  instead,  be  in  the  capital  flows  themselves.  The  capital  flows  were  certainly
excessive  in  the  sense  that  they  were  greater  than  could  be  absorbed  (i.e.  the  capital  flows  were
substantially larger than the current account deficits; see graph). The capital inflows into Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand in the five years 1990–94 were twice as large as the current
account  deficits  (Calvo  and  Goldstein.  1996,  p. 125).  Capital  inflows  into  Thailand  in  1996,  for
example,  were  equal  to  13%  of  GDP.  The  “excess”  flows  went  to  increase  the  foreign  exchange
reserves of the recipient country (in effect, being recycled back to the capital-exporting countries).
But in the process they made the normal cycle in the recipient country much worse: providing the
funding  to  make  the  expansion  phase  of  the  cycle  go  more  strongly  and  last  longer,  driving  up
domestic demand and asset prices. While there were both “push” and “pull” factors for the capital
flows, it is clear that the capital flows were not simply a passive accommodating force responding to
the fundamental economic factors occurring in the capital-importing countries.

Two things stand out from this overall picture. First, the extraordinary increase in the flows starting
in 1990, with this increase being truly phenomenal in Asia. By the mid-1990s, developing countries
were taking 40% of global foreign direct investment (compared with 15% in 1990) and accounted
for 30% of global portfolio equity flows (compared with 2% at the start of the decade) (World Bank
1997,  p. 9).  The  second  aspect  to  observe  is  just  how  volatile  the  flows  could  be,  even  in  these
multi-year  averages.1  Following  the  Latin  American  debt  crisis  of  1982,  inflows  to  that  region
turned into outflows nearly as large, and these outflows were sustained until the end of the decade.
Just as the law begins with a presumption of innocence, economics begins with a presumption that
market outcomes will be beneficial: there is an a priori case that international capital flows are a
Good Thing. Financial flows supplement domestic saving, allowing more investment to be done in
those countries where returns are highest; they buffer the variations over time between exports and
imports; foreign direct investment brings the advantages of technological transfer; there  are  gains
for savers from diversification; and, to complete the case for free capital flows, we should record the
argument that even speculative capital flows can serve a beneficial purpose.
Perhaps the classic model for the beneficial operation of capital flows is illustrated by Singapore in
the 1970s and 1980s. The flows were very large, amounting on average to around 10% of GDP and
in  some  years  15%.  They  were  used  to  substantially  increase  the  rate  of  investment  (i.e.  not  for
consumption), and there was a substantial technological transfer that went  with  the  foreign  direct
investment which dominated the flows. Following the “stages of development” academic literature,
we can see these flows being used to partially fund the catch-up as Singapore moved towards the
technological  frontier  and  its  living  standards  rose  to  equal  those  of  the  industrialised  Western
countries.  This  sustained  increase  in  living  standards  is  confirmation  that  the  combination  of
application of capital and education produced very large and sustainable increases in production per

The  sort  of  volatility  that  concerns  us  here  is  not  the  day-by-day  or  week-by-week  “noise”,  but  the  big
disruptive swings.

head.2  In  a  mutually  reinforcing  process,  the  profit  opportunities  fostered  the  development  of  the
institutional channels which, at the same time, facilitated the capital flows.3
This experience might give us some clues to analysing why these flows occurred more generally,
why  there  was  a  huge  increase  in  the  1990s,  and  the  role  capital  flows  played  in  the  subsequent
Asian crisis. There are two broad groupings of factors involved:
•  the  presence  of  abnormal  profit  opportunities  as  these  countries  moved  towards  the
technological frontier;
•  an institutional structure which facilitates the flows of capital.
Profit differentials
The  countries  of  Asia,  with  their  high  rates  of  growth,  provided  high  profit  levels  and  many
opportunities  for  profitable  investment.  Expected  returns  on  equity  in  emerging  markets  were
consistently higher than those in mature markets, and their volatility was slightly below that of the
mature  markets,  indicating  high  risk-adjusted  returns  (IMF  1998,  p. 32).  Equity  and  stock  prices
were also performing strongly (IMF 1998, p. 38).
Growth and foreign investment certainly went hand in hand, although it might be noted that there
was a stronger relationship in the 1980s than during the 1990s.4 Of course, on top of these potential
returns,  there  was  also  a  question  of  exchange  rate  expectations,  and  we  will  return  to  this  issue
when we look at reasons for the volatility of flows. For the moment, it is enough to record that there
were ex post large excess returns on investment in the emerging Asian markets, taken as a whole.
While it might seem, at first sight, that the main action in terms of profit differentials would come
from the great opportunities available in the capital-receiving countries, it seems that quite a bit of
the  action –  at  least  in  the  variability  of  the  flows –  came  from  changes  in  interest  rates  and
exchange  rates  in  the  capital-supplying  countries:  “push”  factors  rather  than  “pull”  factors.  A
powerful force encouraging greater flows was the lower interest rates in most developed countries in
the early 1990s (US interest rates fell by 200 basis points between 1991 and 1993). The low rates
made some investors search out higher returns overseas, and in seeking higher returns, they were
ready to accept greater risks. Such was this new attitude that spreads on Brady bonds were bid down
sharply in the early 1990s.

This  is  not  to  take  sides  in  the  Krugman  debate  on  Singapore  productivity:  whether  this  came  from  more
capital or total factor productivity, the result – in terms of higher living standards – is not in dispute.
Foreign direct investment has been the key form of capital inflow for Singapore in its rapid development from
the 1970s onwards. Foreign direct investment accounted for around 50% of net capital inflows in the 1970s
and were the bulk of capital inflows in the 1980s, largely in manufacturing, trade and financial and business
services. Direct investment flows surged from 1987 onwards, spurred by Japanese and European investment,
particularly  in  financial  and  business  services  and,  to  a  much  lesser  extent,  in  electronics  manufacturing,
reflecting  the  changes  in  Singapore’s  industrial  structure  and  comparative  advantage.  Foreign  direct
investment as a proportion of investment accelerated during the late 1980s. (This was also the period of the
great surge in Singapore’s share accumulation index, which captures capital and income gains from shares.)
Excluding cyclical effects, the incremental capital/output ratio for Singapore steadily fell from the 1970s to
the 1990s – which suggests that the marginal efficiency of capital was still rising and investment opportunities
were there to be exploited. Moreover, real interest rates were relatively high in this period. During the 1990s,
however,  real  interest  rates  have  come  down,  and,  in  recent  years  at  least,  Singapore’s  incremental
capital/output ratio seems to have started to rise. At the same time, portfolio flows also rose substantially, in
both an absolute and relative sense.

As  the  decade  progressed,  an  important  source  of  capital  flow  was  Japan.  Not  only  was  it
intrinsically a large saver, but the drawn-out recession meant that interest rates were extremely low
(reaching half a percentage point) during most of the 1990s. Much of this capital flow went initially
to  the  United  States,  but  with  the  size  of  the  US  current  account  deficit  set  by  the
savings/investment balance, these extra inflows were recycled and, in effect, funded the outflows to
emerging  countries.  The  interest  differential  between  the  major  industrial  countries  and  the
emerging countries was greatest for Japan – hence the rise of the “yen-carry” trade – borrowing at
low  interest  rates  in  yen,  and  onlending  at  high  returns  in  other  currencies,  particularly  in  Asia.
When  local  currency  borrowing  rates  were  around  20%  (which  was  the  case,  for  example,  in
Indonesia), yen-based interest rates seemed extraordinarily attractive.5
There  was  another  important  structural  change  in  Japan  which  began  in  the  late  1980s  but
accelerated in the first half of the 1990s. With the very rapid and sustained appreciation of the yen,
Japanese  manufacturers  recognised  that  they  needed  to  transfer  a  large  proportion  of  Japan’s
manufacturing  production  (particularly  at  the  low  end  of  the  technology  spectrum)  to  the  lower
labour cost countries of Asia. This was a fundamental factor in driving the increase in foreign direct
investment to the region.6
Was “push” or “pull” more important? In  a  structural  sense,  the  high-profit  “pull”  of  the  capital-
receiving  countries  was  clearly  fundamental.  But  short-term  variation  (surges  and  reversals)  was
often triggered by events in world markets. A number of researchers have found a close relationship
between interest rate movements in the capital-exporting countries and capital flows.7 The rise in
US  interest  rates  in  early  1994  was  an  important  trigger  in  the  Mexican  problems,  and  the
strengthening  of  the  yen  in  May/June 1997  was  a  factor  in  calling  into  question  the  continuing
profitability of the “yen carry”.
Institutional structure
We  noted  earlier  that  profit  opportunities  in  the  emerging  countries  were  probably  greater  in  the
1980s than in the 1990s, yet the surge of capital did not come until 1990. This would suggest that,
while relative profit prospects were important, other factors were also involved. In this section, we
explore  the  importance  of  the  institutional  channels  of  transmission –  did  the  institutions  exist  to
facilitate, in a fairly frictionless way, flows which were attracted by the high profit opportunities?
This  is,  of  course,  a  chicken-and-egg  issue:  as  the  capital  flowed,  it  encouraged  the  further
development of financial infrastructure. In the ten years between 1985 and 1994, for example, the
combined  market  capitalisation  of  the  eighteen  major  developing  countries  in  the  IFC  Emerging
Markets  Index  increased  by  a  factor  of  thirteen.  This  process  was  spurred  by  greater  knowledge

In thirteen of the twenty quarters to mid 1997, the “yen-carry” trade for yen/baht was profitable (i.e. exchange
rate changes did not outweigh  the  interest  differential),  and  for  the  equivalent  yen/US dollar  transaction,  it
proved profitable in eighteen of the twenty quarters (IMF 1998, p. 44).
Foreign direct investment from Japan tripled in the decade to 1997, rising from US$ 22.3 billion in 1986 to
US$ 66.2 billion  in  1997.  While  the  United  States  and  Europe  remain  important  destinations  for  Japan’s
foreign direct investment, the Asian share noted the largest rise, increasing from around 10% of the total in
1986  to  25%  in  1997.  The  rise  is  most  spectacular  in  foreign  direct  investment  into  China,  with  its  share
jumping  from  1  to  almost  9%  over  this  period.  Indonesia  was  another  important  beneficiary.  These  flows
were very important to the countries concerned; Japanese total foreign direct investment to Korea, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand accounted for around 46% of total net foreign direct investment to
these countries between 1990 and 1995.

about these countries. One measure of this was the increase in formal credit ratings given by major
agencies: eleven countries had ratings in 1989; by 1997 this had risen to over fifty.8
Part  of  the  increase  in  the  1990s  reflects  the  conclusion  of  the  Latin  American  debt  crisis  of  the
1980s, marked by the issue of Brady bonds in 1989. With these, previous debt was settled in a way
that could give new investors confidence that their debts would be honoured. Not only did the Brady
bonds settle the longstanding debt problems from the 1982 crisis, but they also  signalled  that  the
authorities in the capital-exporting countries (particularly the United States) might help to sort out
problems when they arrived. This would have given institutional investors some comfort.
One  reason  often  cited  to  explain  the  increase  in  capital  flows  in  the  1990s  was  the  reduction  in
various forms of capital controls in the emerging countries. This must certainly have been a factor.9
But a number of these countries had an accommodating attitude to many forms of capital flows well
before the 1990s (Indonesia, for example, had essentially open capital markets since 1970).
While all of these factors played a part, the dominant new factor of the 1990s, not present in earlier
episodes, was the greatly increased importance of institutional funds managers.

With around US$ 1 to 2  trillion  increase  in  the  portfolios  of  the  institutional  investors  each  year
during  the  1990s,  there  was  clearly  great  potential  to  fund  flows  to  emerging  markets,  when
attention turned to them. And turn to them it did. Not only were there big increases in these funds,
but during the 1990s they became more focused on the need for portfolio diversification and shifted
from having almost no exposure to emerging countries to having significant exposure (although still
substantially  less  than  most  rules  of  thumb  for  portfolio  diversification  would  suggest10).  At  the
general  level,  we  can  see  the  increase  in  international  integration  from  measures  of  cross-border
transactions in bonds and equities. For the United States, these were equal to less than 10% of GDP
in  1980,  around  100%  by  1989,  and  200%  by  1997.11  Another  general  measure:  nonresident
holdings of US public debt were around 15% of total in the 1980s, but 40% by 1997.12

See IMF 1997, p. 244.
For example, the index of capital controls calculated by the IMF fell significantly in 1992–94 (see IMF 1997,
p. 242).
The usual rule is that diversification should match the capitalisation of equity markets. French and Poterba
(1991) point out that at the end of the 1980s, US investors held 94% of their equity wealth in US securities,
and for Japanese, the figure was 98%. It was higher still for French, Germans and Canadians.

In  addition  to  these  institutional  investors,  banks  have  become  more  internationalised,  readier  to
lend  to  emerging  countries.  The  high  profile  of  the  mutual  funds  (and,  in  particular,  the  hedge
funds) may distract attention from the central role of the banks. We will see, in a moment, that the
bank flows were not just large, but were very volatile.

Variability
While the general case in favour of capital flows is a powerful one, the practical problem is their
variability: the  surges  and  reversals.  There  has  always  been  variation  in  capital  flows,  as  relative
interest rates changed over the cycle, as profit opportunities opened up and were competed away,
and in response to general factors of confidence and exchange rate expectations. However, for the
most  part,  the  variability  is  not  enormous.  Picking  an  example  close  to  home,  even  when
international  financial  markets  lost  confidence  in  the  Australian  dollar  in  the  mid  1980s  (the
“Banana Republic” episode), the exchange rate reacted significantly, but capital continued to flow
to Australia – in fact, enough to fund a larger current account deficit as the crisis proceeded.
The recent experience in Asia has been very different, with strong surges and major reversals of the
flows.13
Worth noting is the difference of behaviour between banks and institutional investors, on the one
hand, and foreign direct investment, on the other. In this episode at least, foreign direct investment
has  proven  to  be  the  most  resilient  inflow  and  bank  inflows  the  most  flighty  (World  Bank  1997,
p. 31).  This  accords  with  the  presumption  that  direct  investment  is  harder  to  reverse  and  is  more
focused on the “fundamentals”.

It  was  the  banks  which  reversed  their  positions  dramatically  as  the  crisis  broke:  having  averaged
US$ 16 billion annual inflow to the five troubled Asian countries, it rose to US$ 58 billion for most
of 1995 and 1996, fell to an annual rate of US$ 22 billion in the last quarter of 1996 and for most of
1997, but by the last quarter of 1997 and the first quarter of 1998 recorded an actual outflow of over
US$ 75 billion.14 This might give us the first clue as to reasons for the much sharper variation in
flows in the 1990s. Not only did these institutional developments mean  that  the  volume  of  flows
increased, but, with the greatly increased importance of portfolio and banking flows, its nature (and
particularly its volatility) changed.
In this section, I will argue that the volatility of flows was a product of:

•  the tiny size of financial markets in the emerging countries, relative to the capital-exporting
countries. Size – or relative size – does matter. Minor portfolio adjustments for fund managers
were large changes for the recipient countries;
•  there was a lack of information and understanding about the emerging markets, which meant
that opinion was fickle and not well anchored by the fundamentals;
•  risk premia do not seem to follow a monotonic process, increasing steadily as risk increases.
Rather, risk seems to be more like a binary (“on or off”) process;
•  finally, the emerging economies were in such a state of transition or flux that it is not sensible
to think of this as an equilibrium process, with profit expectations continuously equilibrated
across international markets. This disequilibrium manifests itself most clearly in the exchange
rate (what Obstfeld (1998, p. 6) calls “an open economy’s most important price”). This central
linking  price  which  is  at  the  heart  of  cross-border  profit  calculations  is  uncertain  and
unanchored – it could shift sharply, and there were no strong forces at work bringing it back
towards  its  starting  point.  As  exchange  rate  expectations  changed,  capital  flows  responded
strongly.
(a) 
Relative size
These recipients of the capital inflows were small relative to the size of the flows. While net capital
inflows into the United States were over US$ 180 billion,15 this figure was only a little over twice
the size of the flows going into Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Compare
this  to  the  size  of  these  economies,  credit  systems  and  share  markets,  where  the  United  States
dwarfs these countries by a ratio of around ten to one.
The problem has been described by the BIS this way: “This asymmetry, coupled with the ebbs and
flows that have historically characterised portfolio investment in emerging countries, highlights the
potential for instability as a  marginal  portfolio  adjustment  by  the  investor  can  easily  amount  to  a
first-order  event  for  the  recipient”  (BIS  (June)  1998,  p. 90).  “The  sums  involved  were  relatively
small from the perspective of individual investors, even if of dangerous size from the perspective of
the recipients” (BIS (June) 1998, p. 169).

Information
- 9 -
Some  of  the  explanation  for  the  reversals  can  be  found  in  the  paucity  of  information,  among
investors, about the emerging markets. For the most part, their knowledge was so superficial that it
could  be  (and  was)  overwhelmed  by  the  arrival  of  relatively  small  amounts  of  new  information.
More importantly, investors without their own knowledge base simply followed the herd. In such a
world, it is rational  for  any  individual  player  to  shift  with  the  herd  when  new  perceptions  arrive.
Whatever the fundamentals, when the herd is running, you run with it. In its usual understated way,
the BIS observed that: “highly correlated strategies across different players may have contributed to
an aggravation of asset price movements” (BIS (June) 1998, p. 95).
The informational problems were compounded by the biased and ill-founded nature of much of the
information and commentary. Looking back on it, it might seem surprising that there were not more
pundits, highlighting the excessive nature of the flows and the domestic policymaking deficiencies
of  the  recipient  countries.  But  who  would  these  pundits  be?  Among  the  policy  officials  in  the
recipient countries, the flows (and the development of sophisticated financial sectors) were a sign of
progress  and  modernity:  who  would  want  to  express  doubts  about  that?  In  academic  circles,  the
dominant paradigm was “efficient markets” – who would be bold enough to question the outcome
of  the  market?  Any  unexplained  differential  was  passed  off  as  a  “risk  premium” –  the  academic
“fifth ace” that could square any circle and explain any regression result, no matter how different
from  the  “priors”.  In  the  financial  markets  themselves,  who  was  going  to  bite  the  hand  that  fed
them?16  Some  of  the  subsequent  commentary  suggests  naivety  on  the  part  of  the  investors  (they
“received repeated assurances that the financial sector was well supervised… and that there would
be no changes in exchange rate policy” (IMF 1998, p. 41)). In hindsight, the degree of ignorance is
so great as to border on the comic.  Business Week (22 September 1998) reports a fund manager’s
response to the Russians’ halting of trade in their domestic debt market in this way: “Nobody in the
history of the world has ever done anything this foolish”. Some sense of history!
At  the  same  time,  it  should  be  noted  that  information  that  was  available  was  not  used.  The  BIS
banking data provided a comprehensive view on what turned out to be the most volatile element of
the flows, but the existence of these data was either unknown or ignored.17 As far as the outcome is
concerned, however, unused information was as irrelevant as unavailable information.

The behaviour of risk premia
The process of assessing and reassessing risk is captured, to some extent, in the pricing of emerging
market debt.

But this does not capture the full extent of the problem. As Sachs (1997) observed: “euphoria turned
to panic without missing a beat”. One of the characteristics of capital flows in the crisis was their
reversal –  it  was  not  simply  a  matter  of  the  capital-receiving  countries  being  forced  to  pay
somewhat more for the capital, because of a changing perception of risk. New flows dried up and
existing capital fled, and could not be lured back at any price. Considerations of risk seem to be a
binary (on/off) process, rather than a monotonic function. In part, this was a rational response by
lenders. Even well-run enterprises had their profit (and repayment) prospects radically altered by the
new  environment  of  high  interest  rates,  massive  falls  in  exchange  rates  and  shattered  growth
prospects.  Once  interest  rates  rose  sharply,  a  different  calculus  became  relevant –  the  credit  risk
overwhelmed  any  risk-premium  calculation.  Credit  lines  were  cut.  This  is  in  keeping  with  the
theoretical  work  of  Stiglitz  and  Weiss  (1981),  who  show  that  when  interest  rates  go  up  sharply,
lenders recognise that the only borrowers who are willing to pay these high rates are those who do
not intend to pay back.
This process was not helped by the behaviour of credit rating agencies, who went along with the
general pre-crisis euphoria, and exacerbated the turnaround of opinion by substantial downgradings
after  the  crisis  had  occurred.  As  these  downgrades  shifted  some  financial  instruments  below
investment grade, institutions with portfolio constraints on asset quality were forced to sell – at any
price. The fact that many of these portfolios were judged month-by-month or even day-by-day led to
strong short-termism.

It may be useful to recall, also, the old distinction between risk and uncertainty – it was the latter
(whose characteristic is unpredictability) rather than the former that was relevant, and perhaps we
should not be surprised that uncertainty premia can shift dramatically.
(d) 
A disequilibrium process
These  capital-receiving  emerging  countries  were  being  transformed  at  such  a  pace  that  it  is  not
sensible or realistic to see the process in terms of the usual textbook notions of returns equilibrated
at  the  margin  and  smooth  allocation  of  resources,  particularly  capital.  Systems  were  in  flux,  and
production functions were changing continuously. This general notion manifested itself in various
ways, but three examples will illustrate the issue.
The  first  example  of  apparent  disequilibrium  in  capital  flows  was  identified  nearly  two  decades
ago –  the  Feldstein/Horioka  paradox  (1980) –  there  seemed  to  be  too  much  correlation  between
domestic saving and investment rates in individual countries, with the implication that capital flows
between countries were smaller than would occur in a well integrated world. So here, perhaps, is
another clue to the puzzle. It is not so much that capital flows rose suddenly to achieve abnormally
high levels, but that they were – for some reason – less than optimal earlier, and so the big increase
was a move towards a more normal or equilibrium situation.18 These are asset or stock equilibria.
When  these  ill-defined  and  easily  changeable  temporary  equilibria  are  displaced  by  a  shift  of
confidence, the flow requirements to shift from the old to the new stock equilibrium may be very
large (and very disruptive).
Second,  profits  (or  even  expected  profits)  were  not  equilibrated  across  countries.  For  a  sustained
period (through the 1980s), excess profits  had  been  earned,  illustrated  by  equity  returns  and  high
domestic real interest rates in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand.
                                                     
18
Indeed,  the  constant  revisiting  of  the  Feldstein/Horioka  result  has  found  less  correlation  between  domestic
saving  and  investment  rates  over  time,  implying  increasing  international  capital  integration  (Fujiki  and
Kitamura 1995; Ghosh 1995).

The high interest rates were imposed by the authorities to rein in very dynamic economies, where
many  investors  wanted  to  borrow  to  exploit  the  profit  opportunities.19  The  capital  flows  which
occurred  were  not  sufficient  (or  could  not  be  absorbed  sufficiently  quickly)  to  exploit  all  the
opportunities. There was a widespread belief (based on actual experience, pre-crisis) that whatever
factory  or  office  building  was  constructed  would  prove  profitable,  because  of  the  tremendous
growth of these economies. No matter how much capital flowed, the marginal investor did not feel
that  his  actions  had  used  up  the  last  abnormal  profit  opportunity,  and  that  a  “normal  profit”
equilibrium  had  been  reached.  Investors  could  not  tell  if  what  they  were  seeing  were  temporary
abnormal profits (in which they should try to get themselves a share of the action), or high return
because  of  high  risk.  Too  many  assumed  it  was  the  former.  To  the  extent  that  markets  acted  to
equilibrate  returns,  they  did  so  by  bidding  up  asset  prices  (thus  reducing  the  profit  return  of  the
investor  who  paid  the  higher  price).  But  this  was  a  knife-edge  equilibration:  as  asset  prices  rose,
investors  extrapolated  the  rise,  so  that  even  if  the  profit  flow  on  the  asset  was  normal,  investors
expected  to  benefit  from  continuing  asset  price  increases.  So  investment  continued  until  obvious
excess capacity emerged, and the bubble burst.

They were not, as is sometimes claimed, high to support exchange rates; exchange rates were under upward
pressure for most of the period.
BIS Review   96/1998

The third manifestation of disequilibrium was in the exchange rate. What is the “right” exchange
rate for a country receiving large capital inflows and likely to go on receiving them for a protracted
period – perhaps a decade or more – before investment returns are reduced to “normal”? This relates
to the old issue of the “transfer problem” – how to bring about the current account deficit that is the
real resources counterpart of the financial capital inflow. For this, the exchange rate probably has to
appreciate  from  its  underlying  value.  But  how  far?  Portfolio  equilibrium  would  suggest  that  the
appreciation  must  be  enough  to  create  the  expectation  of  a  subsequent  depreciation,  at  a  rate  to
balance the higher expected returns on domestic, compared with foreign, assets, i.e. to balance the
differential  between  the  domestic  interest  rate  and  the  foreign  rate.  If  this  view-of-the-world
captured  reality,  we  would  see  a  once-off  appreciation  followed  by  a  long  drawn-out  steady
depreciation, at a rate equal to the difference between domestic and foreign interest rates. It hardly
needs saying that this – with  its  implication  of  a  continuous,  enduring,  finely  balanced  calculus –
did  not  fit  reality,  even  remotely.  True,  exchange  rates  in  these  countries  were  under  continual
upward  pressure  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s.  But  this  was,  by  and  large,  resisted  (and  did  not
happen much in real terms, covertly, via faster domestic inflation). Then, more or less once-off and
suddenly, exchange rates experienced massive falls.
So what story fits the facts better? Capital flows involve, for one or other of the parties, a foreign
exchange risk.20 For the period of inflow during the first half of the 1990s, the authorities in these
countries  were  holding  more  or  less  fixed  exchange  rates  in  order  to  stop  an  over-appreciation
which  would  have  cut  into  their  international  competitiveness  and  the  dynamism  which  the
tradeables sector was providing to the economy (and, incidentally, made them vulnerable to changes
of  confidence  when  markets  became  concerned  about  overvaluation).  Investors  knew  this  (as  did
borrowers in these countries), so they were prepared to take the risk of having a foreign exchange
exposure without covering it (c.f. the “yen carry”), on the view that these exchange rates were more
likely to appreciate than depreciate.21 Herd behaviour was important in the capital surge, as well as
in  the  withdrawals  of  capital.  The  smart  money  went  to  these  countries  in  response  to  the  profit
opportunities, and lots of dumb money followed along for the ride, financing dubious investment
projects.  Once  there  was  a  turning-point  in  confidence,  there  was  a  rush  for  the  exits.  The  herd
charged in the reverse direction. As well, the elements of leverage which had built up during  the
capital inflow stage made it imperative that positions be unwound quickly when the reversal came –
leveraged investors cannot wait for the market to return to its senses: they sell or they are sold. To
make matters worse, these forced sales took place in markets which had become illiquid – when no
one wants to take on these risks, the price falls a long way. In textbook markets, price falls bring out
bargain hunters: in these markets, price falls just confirmed the worst fears.
The problem is that asset prices (whether real estate or the exchange rate) are quite random in the
short run, and the short run is the investment horizon relevant to fund managers – they are judged on
their  quarter-by-quarter  (or  month-by-month)  performance.  In  a  market  dominated  by  such
investors, there are no Friedmanite stabilising speculators to buy when the price falls. Even rational
investors join the herd.

21
Even hedging simply shifts this to another party.
Some have described this process of fixed exchange rates as “guarantees”, but this misunderstands the nature
of the problem: certainly, investors did not expect the exchange rate to depreciate much, but they knew that
depreciations had occurred in the past, and those who had exposures in currencies other than the US dollar
(by far the majority – see Goldstein and Hawkins (1998)) had been continually experiencing changes in the
relevant  exchange  rate.  But  few  of  them  saw  any  reason,  in  a  world  in  which  capital  flows  were  putting
upward pressure on exchange rates, to take out expensive cover against the possibility of the exchange rate
falling sharply.
BIS Review   96/1998

While we might be amazed at the extent of the movements in exchange rates (the rupiah falling to
less than a fifth of its initial value, which no one at the time thought was significantly overvalued),
we should not be surprised by the failure of the portfolio model of exchange rate behaviour (or any
other exchange rate model, for that matter). The most basic and central idea in any view relying on
the efficient markets hypothesis is uncovered interest rate parity – that interest rate differentials are
the  best  predictor  of  subsequent  exchange  rate  movements.  Despite  the  most  diligent,  strenuous
efforts on the part of those who have built models and academic reputations on the efficient markets
hypothesis, the data inconveniently but consistently refute it.22 So is it any surprise that, once fixed
exchange  rates  were  dislodged  (by  a  combination  of  large  adverse  terms-of-trade  shifts,  some
modest over-appreciation through inflation, and adverse international commentary), the unanchored
rates could swing to absurd values: there were no accepted views on fundamentals. Investors had
seen how much the yen/US dollar rate moved during the 1990s (in well understood, deep markets):
it is hardly surprising that they would not stand in the way of huge swings in Asian currencies. By
the  time  extrapolative  expectations  took  hold,  demand  curves  for  foreign  exchange  sloped  the
wrong way: as the price became cheaper, people bought less.
Once  this  was  teamed  with  large  open  exposures,  the  fragile  financial  sectors  of  these  countries
collapsed, under the weight of their own open foreign exchange positions in some cases, but more
often  under  the  collapsing  creditworthiness  of  their  commercial  sector  borrowers  (who  did  have
large uncovered foreign exchange exposure). This collapse of the financial system interacted with
the real economy: even good investment projects (and there were plenty of bad ones) turned sour in
the face of credit withdrawal and deep economic recession. The rest, as they say, is history.
Conclusion
More than a century ago, Bagehot observed: “the same instruments which diffused capital through a
nation are gradually diffusing it among nations.” He went on to warn that while “the effect of this
will  be  in  the  end  much  to  simplify  the  problems  of  international  trade…  for  the  present,  as  is
commonly the case with incipient causes whose effect is incomplete, it complicates all it touches”
(Bagehot  1880,  p. 71).23  This  encapsulates  a  key  insight:  as  countries  integrate  their  financial
markets with international markets – itself an eminently desirable process – there is a longish period
of transition, during which an economy is extremely vulnerable to changes of confidence.
There  had  been  plenty  of  hand-wringing  about  this  issue  beforehand.  Before  the  1997  crisis,  the
World  Bank  summarised  the  situation  this  way:  “The  world’s  financial  markets  are  rapidly
integrating into a single global marketplace, and ready or not, developing countries, starting from
different  points  and  moving  at  various  speeds,  are  being  drawn  into  this  process.  If  they  have
adequate institutions and sound policies, developing countries may proceed smoothly along the road
to financial integration and gain the considerable benefits that integration can bring. Most of them,
however, lack the prerequisites for a smooth journey, and some may be so ill-prepared that they lose
more than they gain from financial integration.” (World Bank 1997, p. 1).
Substantial capital inflows to the emerging countries were not irrational, unnatural or undesirable.
While all sensible observers point to the benefits of capital flows, the variability is clearly harmful,
but  hard  to  correct:  “boom  and  bust  cycles  are  hardly  a  sideshow  or  a  minor  blemish  on
international capital flows: they are the main story” (Rodrik 1998, p. 56). As Bhagwati (1998) notes:
“the ‘panics, manias and crashes’ that characterise capital flows have no counterpart in trade flows”.
The issue is: what to do?
                                                     
22
The staunchest supporters of interest rate parity must have had their faith sorely tested by the extraordinary
movements of the yen in the 1990s, in a climate of interest rate stability.

Any policy that attempts to isolate an economy from international capital markets would be costly,
in terms of forgone growth. The need, now, is to devise an institutional structure which can reap the
benefits  of  capital  flows  while  diminishing  the  risks  to  those  countries  whose  financial
infrastructure is not yet resilient enough to cope. What needs to change?
One early response was to try to identify some technical deficiency whereby the real world did not
mimic the efficient markets of the textbooks, and assume that correcting this will fix the problem.
We noted that information deficiencies were one reason why opinions, confidence and critical prices
(such as the exchange rate) were unanchored and subject to violent change. After the Mexican crisis
of 1994/95, there was a line of argument that came very close to saying that if Mexico had revealed
its  foreign  exchange  reserve  levels  more  explicitly  during  1994,  somehow  the  crisis  would  have
been averted. A variant of this emerged in the early days of the Thai  crisis:  if  only  Thailand  had
revealed  its  forward  foreign  exchange  position,  markets  would  have  operated  smoothly  to  avoid
crisis. This seems to be naïve, but we have to be careful in pointing this out: to question the benefits
of greater transparency is like arguing against peace, freedom and motherhood. So let me be quick
to  say  that  more  transparency  would  help.  But  it  is  another  thing  again,  in  a  world  of  complex
causality,  to  see  this  as  a  fundamental  solution.  After  all,  it  is  hard  to  explain  the  extraordinary
movements in asset prices in sophisticated markets (US equities in 1987; the yen in 1995–98). How
much more information is needed to prevent swings of this sort?
A  similar  “fix-it”  has  been  suggested,  in  the  form  of  elimination  of  “guarantees”  and  “moral
hazard”.  We  have  already  noted  that  many  of  the  so-called  guarantees  were,  more  accurately,
misassessments  by  optimistic  market  players –  they  were  guarantees  only  in  the  eyes  of  the
investors. Moral hazard is a more believable market deficiency, at least in some specific cases. For
example, financial markets were confident, based on experience, that countries do  not  devalue  or
renege on foreign debts while they are under the tutelage of an IMF program, and this gave investors
in Russia earlier this year a false sense of security. The answer, on the surface, seems simple: make
sure investors lose money from time to time. This, like many solutions, is supported in general but
difficult to apply in specific cases. As George Soros (1998) has noted: “Financial markets… resent
any  kind  of  government  interference,  but  they  hold  a  belief  that,  if  conditions  get  rough,  the
authorities  will  step  in.”  Once  governments  have  helped,  moral  hazard  is  part  of  investment
decisions from then on. So let us, by all means, try to reduce it by requiring “burden sharing” on the
part of private sector investors (see below). But let us not fool ourselves into thinking that it can be
entirely eliminated.
A further variant on the fix-the-market approach suggested that markets were not sufficiently open.
In  the  early  days  of  the  Asian  crisis,  a  common  argument  held  that  the  problem  was  simple
deficiencies in domestic policymaking and  open  capital  accounts  are  the  best  discipline  on  errant
policymakers.  There  is  truth  in  this  argument –  countries  which  do  not  make  policy  mistakes
certainly stand a better chance of weathering the international storms (c.f. Stiglitz’s rowboats). But
it is not realistic to hope for continuously perfect policies. We need a framework that can cope with
the inevitable imperfections of the policy process. As well, with the crisis much further developed,
we can now see that even countries with good policies, sound infrastructure and high openness can
come under enormous pressure (c.f. Hong Kong). So, even if policymakers (working as they do in
imperfect, politically driven worlds) were able to produce consistently good policies (a big ask), this
is no assurance against volatility in capital flow.
We have to accept that markets, even under as favourable conditions as are likely to be found in the
real  world,  have  not –  and  will  not –  consistently  act  as  a  smooth,  well  informed,  far-sighted
Walrasian auction process to maximise benefits and minimise the costs of capital flows. “Given the
troubling way in which economic, political and social  factors  interact,  it  is  simply  not  prudent  to
BIS Review   96/1998
- 16 -
assume that everything will turn out for the best.” (BIS (June) 1998, p. 170). So, while we strive for
good policymaking, and urge more information disclosure (including on the private sector players in
international markets), we need to explore other possibilities.
Part  of  the  problem  in  coming  to  grips  with  these  issues  has  been  the  insistent  voices  of  an
accidental coalition of academics, and vested interests who used the efficient markets paradigm as
an intellectual battering ram to open new commercial opportunities. The intellectual climate is now
undergoing a shift. When the doyen of the hedge funds, George Soros, describes capital flows as “a
wrecker’s ball”, you know the debate has changed.
What specific measures might be explored? Among the spectrum of possibilities, let us start with
the least controversial. Much of the focus should be on improving prudential measures – the “rules
of the game” governing the financial sector, and banks in particular. Much hard work is needed to
make  existing  rules  work  properly –  limiting  connected  and  government-directed  lending;  getting
asset valuations (and hence provisioning) right; and enforcing foreign currency open-position limits.
As well, the rules need to be reinforced. Banks have to be made to take account of their borrowers’
overall balance sheet position, so that the bank is not brought down, at one remove, by the foreign
exchange exposure of its borrowers. Poor credit appraisal was clearly a central factor in the Asian
crisis,  which  now  has  to  be  addressed.  None  of  this  can  be  done  effectively  without  a  good
accounting and legal (including bankruptcy) framework, and, realistically, none of it will be put in
place quickly. Here is the rub. It is difficult – perhaps impossible – to put in place fully effective
supervision  before  financial  development  occurs:  the  markets  will  be  pushing  ahead  faster  than
supervisors. The deregulation process itself is a difficult environment in which to get this right: at
the same time that one set of regulations is dismantled, another set (the prudential rules) has to be
put in place. Hence the debate about sequencing has an academic ring to it. Let’s work hard on the
prudential framework. It will be important. But it may not be enough.24
When things go wrong (as they will from time to time, in even the best managed system), there must
be  clear  methods  of  rapid  resolution.  This  should  include  a  readiness  to  institute  stand-fast  and
workout  arrangements  for  private  debt.  Just  as  bankruptcy  arrangements  should  not  be  too  easily
available for resolution of domestic debts, such international stand-fast and workout arrangements
should only be instigated by some internationally endorsed process (say, as part of an IMF standby
arrangement).  But  we  need  to  be  ready  to  do  this  promptly  when  circumstances  warrant.  Again,
textbook ideas have been unhelpful in practice – the idea that private sector borrowers and lenders
(“consenting adults”) will work things out satisfactorily has proved naïve: the collateral damage is
too great. Private sector debt was (and remains) a festering sore which inhibits the return to health
of some Asian economies. This is not to argue that the private sector should have been bailed out.
Rather, that it should have been quickly and decisively “bailed in”, to bear its full share of the costs
of crisis resolution, through stand-fast and workout arrangements.
Many  of  these  measures  will  remind  lenders  of  the  risks  involved,  and  this  will  raise  the  cost  of
borrowing in good times: but that would be no bad thing. In the same vein, the existence of well-

What of the hedge funds – the butt of both strong attack and spirited defence? It might have been possible,
once, to argue that these funds were playing a useful role as stabilising speculators, buying cheap and selling
dear, to help markets find equilibrium values and smooth the flows. This position is no longer tenable, at least
as a generalisation. There are enough examples, now, of them shorting already undervalued currencies, in the
hope (assisted by vigorous self-serving market commentary) that the undervaluation could be pushed further.
While  they  may  not  be  big  players  in  the  immediate  future,  this  may  be  the  moment  to  emphasise  that
whatever  arguments  there  are  for  disclosure  of  official  market  positions  (reserves  and  forward  positions),
these apply with equal force for large private players. If fully informed markets work better, then let us aim to
ensure that markets are fully informed about the hedge funds.

defined international stand-fast and workout arrangements (and “collective action” clauses in bonds
which make the possibility of workouts explicit) may cause lenders to focus on the possibility of
loss, but wouldn’t that help the moral hazard problems? If more carefully designed and rigorously
enforced prudential controls inhibit some short-term flows, would there be any great loss in that?
Clearly, part of the capital surge of the 1990s could, with benefit, have been done without. Is the
problem – like advertising – that you do not know which part to stop? No. We can see elements –
short-term rootless flows – which had minimum benefits and greatest costs. A case can be made that
it  would  have  been  no  great  loss  if  the  Asian  countries  had  received  only  the  foreign  direct
investment flow. While it is technically true that “speed doesn’t kill – it’s the stopping”, we should
recall that the problems come from excessive inflows, so if the net result of more rigorous “rules of
the game” is smaller inflows in the boom times, then that will be a plus. If something has to give
way in the “open economy trilemma” (Obstfeld and Taylor 1997), then some limits on the variance
of capital flow seem a good place to start.
The third – and most controversial – set of possibilities are those which smack of capital controls.
Even here, the debate has shifted. Now, Chilean-type controls seem to be acceptable to international
opinion. What distinguishes these? They are market-based, upfront and ex ante, and are on inflows
rather than outflows. This is all still a lively topic of debate. The consensus view is changing, but
slowly.  While  now  acknowledging  that  temporary  controls  may  be  required  in  certain
circumstances, the international consensus has a rather disparaging tone. Just as “real men don’t eat
quiche”,  real  countries  don’t  resort  to  capital  controls.  If  such  short-term  capital  controls  are  a
legitimate instrument of policy, we need to define more clearly the circumstances, and be readier to
endorse their use in these conditions.
The alternative to implementing these ideas is inaction – either in the hope that these problems will
go away or because of some ideological position based on the preservation of market purity. This
risks losing the very real benefits of capital flows, if it leads to ill-designed measures by emerging
countries  to  isolate  themselves  from  these  problems.  At  the  same  time,  the  crisis  tarnishes  the
complex  international  trading  structure,  and  adds  to  the  growing  voices  damning  “globalisation”.
Krugman  (1998)  has  reminded  us  that  Keynes  saw  his  interventionist  active  fiscal  proposals  as
necessary to save the market system. Now, changes are needed in international financial markets to
safeguard the continuance of international capital flows, with all the benefits they bring.
