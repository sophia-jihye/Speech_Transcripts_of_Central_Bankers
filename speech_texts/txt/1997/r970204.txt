Mr. Heikensten discusses inflation and the interest rate in Sweden   Address
by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikensten, at a conference arranged
by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce and Veckans Affärer on 29/1/97.
I  should  like  to  begin  with  a  word  of  thanks  for  the  invitation  to  talk  about
economic developments, inflation and the conditions for monetary policy. It is beginning to have
the feel of a tradition.
Today I shall start by considering the course of events since we met here a  year
ago. Then I intend to take a look at the future and paint a picture of the outlook not just for 1997
but for the somewhat longer perspective that is relevant for monetary policy. Finally I shall draw
some policy conclusions.
Growth but not employment
Before considering 1996, however, I shall look further back. Since the summer of
1993, when the dramatic fall in production was broken, the annual growth  rate  in  the  Swedish
economy  has  averaged  about  2.8  per  cent.  This  is  considerably  higher  than  the  rates  we  were
accustomed  to  in  the  1970s  and  1980s.  In  that  capacity  utilisation  was  so  low  initially,  it  is
hardly surprising that growth as such has been high. What is surprising - and very troublesome -
is the weak development of employment.
Sweden is not alone in Europe in having problems with the creation of new jobs;
rather  the  reverse.  But  in  the  United  States  the  situation  is  very  different  and  even  in  Europe
there  are  exceptions;  one  is  Holland  in  the  past  decade  (Diagram  1).  The  differences  from
Sweden are appreciable.
Today in Sweden the issue of unemployment is being discussed more and more. It
is important that the premises for this discussion are correct. At the Riksbank we believe that in
the coming two years production in Sweden will pick up again, although growth is unlikely to
reach  the  average  level  of  the  past  three  to  four  years.  This  should  generate  some  increase  in
employment. But a radical improvement in employment  calls  for  more  than  economic  growth;
above all it requires that the labour market and wage formation function better.
Markedly lower interest rates
When I spoke at this conference a year ago the repo rate was 8.66 per cent. In the
course of 1996 we lowered the rate 25 times. At the end of 1996 the repo rate was 4.10 per cent
as against 8.91 per cent at the beginning. In the industrialised world, the Riksbank’s reduction of
its instrumental rate is accordingly one of the largest and steepest. Moreover, the current level of
the repo rate is the lowest in Sweden for more than thirty years.
The cuts have been gradual and as far as possible predictable. As the outlook for
inflation improved and interest rates declined, market perceptions of how far down the repo rate
might  move  were  also  revised  (Diagram  2).  Our  intention  was  to  bring  the  repo  rate  down
without  any  loss  of  confidence  in  monetary  policy,  as  expressed  in  such  price  variables  as  the
exchange  rate  and  long  bond  rates.  It  worked;  at  no  time  did  the  market  react  so  wildly  as  to
disturb the picture.

There are good reasons for underscoring that such a monetary policy realignment
presupposes  that  many  factors  are  favourable.  That  was  the  case  in  1996.  The  conditions  in
international  financial  markets  were  stable  and  positive  for  Sweden.  Economic  activity  abroad
and  in  Sweden  was  comparatively  weak  and  implied  a  good  outlook  for  inflation.  Sweden’s
fiscal  policy  was  perceived  as  increasingly  credible  as  the  budget  outcome  improved  and  both
the Government and the Riksdag (Sweden’s parliament) demonstrated a  determination  to  fulfil
earlier commitments.
Better outlook for inflation
In Sweden the outlook for inflation improved on several counts:
 Economic activity became somewhat weaker. Export growth slackened as
a  result  of  the  krona’s  appreciation  and  slowdowns  abroad.  This  was  accompanied  by  a
reduction of industrial stocks. The domestic economy was relatively weak, though activity does
seem to have picked up, particularly last autumn. GDP growth probably amounted to between 1
and  1.5  per  cent  (Diagram  3).  In  terms  of  long-term  balance,  the  composition  of  growth  was
favourable,  with  strong  increases  for  net  exports  and  industrial  investment  (Diagram 4).  There
was also a large surplus on current account.
 The  inflation  propensity  seems  to  have  decreased.  The  conditions  for
persistently low inflation improved in a number of respects. The  expected  rate  of  inflation  fell
from survey to survey (Diagram 5). Bond pricing shows a similar picture. Most of the surveyed
groups  now  expect  a  rate  of  inflation,  even  in  the  longer  run,  that  is  well  in  line  with  the
Riksbank’s  target.  In  parts  of  the  economy  it  also  looks  as  though  pricing  behaviour  has
changed;  conceivable  explanations  for  this  include  increased  competition  as  a  result  of
deregulations and EU membership. These tendencies are difficult to confirm for certain but the
indications are clear.
 Temporary  effects  have  also  been  at  work.  The  krona’s  appreciation
accounted  for  approximately  0.4  percentage  points  of  the  fall  in  inflation  from  2.6  per  cent  in
December 1995 to -0.2 per cent in December 1996.  For  the  CPI,  the  part  played  by  decreased
interest  rates  has  been  even  greater;  the  downward  effect  on  the  inflation  from  falling  house
mortgage  rates  totalled  1.4  percentage  points.  It  is  because  of  the  temporary  effects  that  the
average  level  of  the  inflation  in  1996  is  outside  the  Riksbank’s  target  interval.  As  a  rule,  the
interval  surrounding  the  target  figure  should  suffice  to  absorb  changes  of  this  type  in  the
composition  of  inflation.  That  this  was  not  the  case  in  1996  had  to  do  with  the  marked
reappraisal of the situation in Sweden. Both the rate of inflation generated domestically and the
ways  in  which  the  Riksbank  measures  underlying  inflation  show  a  fall  that  is  less  dramatic
(Diagram 6).
Improvement in government finance
Perhaps the most pronounced swing in the past year (actually since the summer of
1995) has occurred for government finance. Confidence grew in the ability of the Government
and the Riksdag to reverse the crisis. A number of factors contributed to this.
The  budget  outcome  successively  improved  in  relation  to  earlier  official
estimates  (Diagram  7).  As  regards  the  budget  deficit  for  1997,  current  estimates  suggest  that
 BIS Review   9/1997
- 3 -
Sweden will do well in a European context. And although Government debt is still  high,  here,
too, the turn seems to be more distinct than expected.
 Another  factor  behind  the  swing  is  the  Government’s  clear  adherence  to
the convergence programme from the summer  of  1995.  When  it  seemed  that  the  budget  target
was in danger in the spring of 1996, additional measures were presented to fulfil the ambitions.
This had favourable effects on interest rates and credibility.
Developments  in  recent  years  prompt  two  distinct  warnings.  Building  up  the
credibility  which  characterised  the  past  year  took  a  long  time  and  was  very  costly.  The
announcement of extensive measures in the winter  of  1994-95  did  not  suffice.  It  was  not  until
the budget outcome started to turn that we could reap the positive effects on bond rates, etc. It
must  also  be  borne  in  mind  that  a  part  of  the  budget’s  reinforcement  is  tied  to  the  stronger
exchange rate and the lower interest rates. Sustained confidence is therefore a sine qua non for
budget consolidation.
In  view  of  the  political  debate,  there  may  be  cause  to  underscore  fiscal  policy’s
importance  for  monetary  policy.  A  tighter  fiscal  policy  normally  implies  a  better  situation  for
inflation; it makes it easier for the Riksbank to fulfil the inflation target in conjunction with low
interest  rates.  In  addition,  a  fiscal  policy  that  lacks  credibility  creates  problems  for  monetary
policy  -  as  was  the  case  during  much  of  the  period  1990-95.  The  radical  lowering  of  interest
rates during 1996 is something for which our thanks are very much due to fiscal policy.
Continued economic upswing
So  much  for  history.  In  discussing  tendencies  for  the  coming  years  I  shall  start
from our inflation report last December.
In the report, conditions for exports in the coming years were judged to be good.
Nothing has occurred to modify that assessment. Industry’s  competitive  position  is  favourable.
To an increasing extent, export growth seems to be coming from rapidly expanding regions, not
least Asia. The international upswing last autumn is expected to  become  somewhat  stronger  in
both 1997 and 1998.
Judging  from  order  inflows  and  other  business  tendency  figures,  the  growth  of
exports is likely to be  modest.  The  most  recent  figures  may  perhaps  indicate  that  international
developments will generate somewhat weaker growth than expected, but the difference would be
marginal. This is countered, moreover, by an exchange rate that, at present at least, is weaker.
The  conditions  for  increased  demand  for  consumption  were  also  judged  to  be
favourable  (Diagram  8).  Neither  has  the  picture  in  this  respect  changed  at  all  substantially.
Increased  consumption  is  indicated  by  low  interest  rates  and  a  level  of  household  saving  that,
historically,  is  relatively  high  and  is  expected  to  show  some  fall.  To  this  can  be  added  an
accumulated need to renew the stock of durable goods. The main factor in the opposite direction
is unemployment, which is persistently high and even tended to rise in the autumn. Neither are
the increments to household  income  in  the  period  1997-98  expected  to  be  as  large  as  in  1996.
Then  there  is  the  uncertainty  that  stems  from  weak  government  finance  and  the  changes  that
have been made and may be called for in the social security system, including pensions. All in
all, however, it seems that the subdued but stable increase in consumption may continue.
BIS Review   9/1997

In  view  of  the  above,  we  adhere  to  the  growth  scenario  that  featured  in  the  last
two inflation reports. This implies an accelerating growth rate that for 1996 and 1997 combined
totals almost 4 per cent. Development in 1996, however, seems to have been marginally weaker
than  we  counted  on.  Some  further  acceleration  of  growth  is  then  foreseen  in  1998.  The
conclusion  in  the  inflation  report  therefore  holds  good:  it  is  not  likely  that  in  the  coming  two
years economic activity will rise above the level of potential output at which inflation is liable to
pick up (Diagram 9).
Wage development a key factor
The  wage  increases  during  1996  exceeded  what  the  Swedish  economy  can
manage in the longer run. The underlying rate of wage increases moved up to more than 5 per
cent.  The  rate  of  wage  increases  on  top  of  collective  agreements  also  accelerated  in
manufacturing.
For price formation in 1996, the  consequences  of  these  tendencies  were  limited.
As  long  as  domestic  demand  remains  subdued,  firms  have  difficulty  in  passing  through  the
increased  wage  costs  to  prices.  The  outcome  is  more  likely  to  be  rationalisation,  increased
productivity and, in certain cases, decreased employment.
The  starting  point  for  the  Riksbank’s  assessment  of  the  future  rate  of  wage
increases  is  that  a  downward  adjustment  will  be  achieved.  At  the  time  of  the  settlements  that
were reached in much of the labour market in 1994-95 the expected level of future inflation was
considerably higher than it is today (Diagram 10). The present credibility of the inflation target
did  not  exist.  Moreover,  employment  was  rising  relatively  fast  in  parts  of  the  economy  and
profits were higher than they are today.
The downward adjustment we foresee is, however, a gradual process and slower
than  would  be  desirable.  As  far  as  inflation  in  the  next  two  years  is  concerned,  the  slow
adjustment is not seen as a problem, at least as long as the situation agrees with the Riksbank’s
main  scenario,  where  the  growth  of  consumption  is  subdued.  For  employment  the  problem  is
greater. Lower wage increases might be accompanied by a faster increase in labour demand.
The new information about the rate of wage increases since the December report
supports  the  assessment  that  some  retardation  should  be  feasible  during  1997.  The  wage
statistics for the most recent months show signs of some improvement. Future wage formation is
being  discussed  by  the  labour  market  organisations.  Apart  from  this,  lower  wage  increases  in
future  agreements  are  indicated  by  a  number  of  factors.  Profit  levels  in  export  companies  are
lower and there is little possibility of passing through costs  to  consumers.  To  date  in  the  1997
negotiations,  wage  demands  have  been  lower  than  in  the  previous  round,  though  still  high  in
relation to the low inflation expectations.
Inflation in line with the target
Over  the  last  six  months,  markets  have  tended  to  focus  on  the  latest  figures  for
inflation.  In  a  way,  this  is  hardly  surprising  -  the  figures  during  the  autumn  have  been
unexpectedly  low.  It  should  be  emphasised,  however,  that  the  Riksbank’s  policy  refers  to  a
BIS Review   9/1997
- 5 -
longer period. Figures for “yesterday’s” inflation are therefore relevant only in so far as they say
something  about  the  future.  To  some  extent  that  has  been  the  case  in  the  past  six  months;  the
figures have suggested a somewhat lower inflation propensity. In the main, however, they have
reflected the strength of the transient effects.
Inflation expectations, as measured in surveys and forecasts, have been stable, in
some  cases  with  a  fall  during  the  autumn  and  winter.  The  expected  rate  of  inflation  one  year
ahead is around 1.5 per cent and the average rate in the next five years is around 2 per cent.
What  about  the  inflation  forecasts  for  the  coming  years?  There  are  many
indications  that  the  12-month  change  figure  for  the  CPI  reached  a  low  in  December,  with  the
prospect  of  gradually  rising  figures  during  the  spring  as  the  transient  effects  that  pushed  price
increases down last year come to an end. At the beginning of 1997, moreover, prices have also
been  affected  by,  for  example,  changes  to  indirect  taxes  and  subsidies;  these  changes  are
expected  to  raise  the  price  level  by  about  0.5  per  cent.  On  the  other  hand,  house  mortgage
interest costs should continue to have a downward effect on prices, at least during 1997.
An upward tendency in inflation is therefore something that the Riksbank counts
on  in  the  next  two  years.  Consequently  it  will  not  come  as  a  surprise,  at  least  as  long  as  it  is
moderate.  In  the  inflation  report  we  envisaged  that  during  1997  the  CPI  would  rise  by  an
average of just under 1.5 per cent. For 1998 it was considered that inflation would be somewhat
higher,  around  2  per  cent,  which  included  an  increase  in  the  price  level  of  about  0.5  per  cent
from further changes in taxes and subsidies (Diagram 11). The assessment accordingly pointed
to a rate of inflation that would be in line with the Riksbank’s target.
Same conclusion
The  picture  I  have  outlined  does  not  warrant  any  change  in  the  conclusions
presented  in  the  December  inflation  report.  Our  main  scenario  suggests  that  at  present  the
monetary stance is relatively well balanced.
The  new  information  about  economic  activity  and  price  movements  points  to  a
picture  of  inflation  in  1997  that  is  marginally  more  positive.  In  the  opposite  direction,  the
exchange  rate  has  been  somewhat  weaker  than  we  counted  on.  While  this  does  not  stem  from
what  are  commonly  referred  to  as  economic  fundamentals,  the  fact  remains  that  a  weaker
exchange  rate  -  which  Sweden  has  now  had  for  a  quarter  or  so  -  has  effects  on  the  picture  of
demand and inflation.
The  Riksbank  will  continue  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  the  interest  rate  cuts  that
were implemented during 1996. As pointed out on many occasions in the past year, we will also
be  keeping  a  close  watch  on  the  future  development  of  economic  activity.  The  ongoing
construction of monetary policy will depend on our assessment of inflation’s future course, for
instance in the light of incoming information.
