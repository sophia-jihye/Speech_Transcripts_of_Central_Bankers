Lars Nyberg: Swedish housing financing and the EMU
Speech by Mr Lars Nyberg,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riskbank,  at  Economics  Day  held at
HSB Bank, Stockholm, on 8 November 2000.
I would like to start by thanking you for inviting me to HSB Bank’s Economics Day and giving me
this opportunity to talk about Swedish housing financing from an EU perspective.
 Introduction
One  of  the  main  purposes  of  the  Single  Market  and  the  introduction  of  EMU  is  to  create  a  more
efficient market for goods and services, a market which is characterised by greater  competition  and
better products at lower prices. On the mortgage market, this should mean that borrowers can expect a
wider range of products, more choice of suppliers and lower interest rates.
The national mortgage markets in Europe vary considerably, as does their significance to the country’s
economy.  This  is  illustrated  in  the  following  diagram  (Figure  1).  In  countries  such  as  Germany,
Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and the UK, the total outstanding stock of loans with property as
collateral  amounts  to  over  50%  of  GDP.  In  other  countries,  such  as  Greece  and  Italy,  the
corresponding  figure  is  less  than  10%.  The  differences  are  mainly  due  to  factors  such  as  different
regulations,  tax  legislation  and  market  structures  in  the  different  countries.  As  in  Sweden,  housing
financing issues have often aroused considerable political interest, a fact which is reflected in all of the
above factors.

In  the  EU,  the  value  of  the  outstanding  stock  of  loans  with  property  as  collateral  was  estimated  at
around SEK4,500 billion at the end of 1999.1 This stock of loans in Europe is mainly financed through
1 According to the European Mortgage Federation

BIS Review 99/2000
various  forms  of  borrowing,  around  62%  (Figure  2).  The  second  largest  source  of  financing,
approximately  19%,  is  through  bonds,  while  a  relatively  new  type  of  financing  in  the  form  of
securitisation comprises around 1% of the outstanding stock of loans with property as collateral. The
United Kingdom is the country in Europe where securitisation is most frequently used, followed by
France,  the  Netherlands  and  Belgium  (Figure  3).  The  market  for  securitised  assets  is  still  rather
undeveloped in the other European countries.

Competition for customers
Although mortgages are a relatively straightforward and standardised financial product that should be
well suited to sell abroad, international mortgage sales have been limited to date. One probable reason
is  that  the  mortgage  market  mainly  targets  private  clients,  which  are  hard  to  reach  without  using  a
local distribution network. In this respect, the Internet should be able to lead to greater transparency
and competition, both by the credit issuers themselves supplying information and credit services over
the Internet and by Internet-based brokerage sites finding the cheapest mortgages for borrowers.
While  Internet-based  mortgage  services  are  still  a  relatively  new  phenomenon,  they  are  likely  to
increase competition on the mortgage market. However, if we look at the spread between the cost of
borrowing and the lending rate for mortgage institutions, there is no indication that the interest margin
for mortgage institutions has fallen as a result of increased competition (Figure 5).

The new Internet-based players on the mortgage market are made up of those who mediate loans via
the  Internet  and  those  who  issue  credit  over  the  Internet.  Players  such  as  Blockbid,  Bolånebörsen,
Comboloan and E-loan search for and mediate the cheapest mortgages for borrowers. Europeloan, on
the other hand, is an Internet-based credit issuer that has operated in Sweden since February 1999. The
company, which also operates in Belgium and Germany, finances mortgages through securitisation.
As more than 70% of the households have chosen floating interest rates on their new loans raised in
the  mortgage  institutions  during  the  last  year,  it  could  be  suitable  to  look  at  the  interest  margin
between short borrowing interest rates for mortgage institutions and floating interest rates on housing
loans (Figure 6). This diagram suggests that the interest margin for mortgage institutions is now about
1.2% compared to about 1.5-1.7% during 1996.

Lending by mortgage institutions to the household sector amounted to about SEK600 billion by the
end of September 2000, compared to SEK581,6 billion at the beginning of the year. About 35% of the
households’  total  borrowing  raised  in  mortgage  institutions  are  loans  with  floating  interest  rates,  ie
about SEK210 billion.
Another reason why cross-border activities have been limited so far is that the mortgage markets are
governed by national regulations. A third reason is that cross-border activities are exposed to foreign
exchange risk.
As long as Sweden is not a member of EMU, foreign players wishing to establish operations on the
Swedish  mortgage  market  will  have  to  offer loans  in  Swedish  kronor, since  Swedish  borrowers  are
unlikely  to  want  to  expose  themselves  to  foreign  exchange  risks.  However,  if  Sweden  joins  EMU,
interest rates offered to borrowers in EMU-affiliated countries will be directly comparable. A common
currency would make it easier for borrowers to assess which credit institution in the common currency
area offers the best conditions. Swedish borrowers will be able to raise loans in euro  without  being
exposed to foreign exchange risk, and access to potential lenders will increase.

The Swedish mortgage sector is  currently  dominated  by  five  companies, one  of  which  -  SBAB  -  is
state-owned  (Figures  7  and  8).  These  five  companies  cover  around  97%  of  the  market.  Since
mortgages are a highly standardised product, the price, ie the rate of interest, will be a decisive factor
in  the  competition  for  customers.  As  competition  on  the  mortgage  market  increases,  the  cost  of
refinancing  will  become  the  decisive  factor  for  mortgage  institutions’  possibilities  to  pursue  a
profitable business. I will therefore devote the rest of this speech to the question of refinancing.

Traditional mortgage financing
Swedish mortgage institutions finance their operations mainly by issuing bonds and certificates. The
entire  balance  sheet  of  the  mortgage  institution  serves  as  security  for  borrowing,  and  consequently
each loan is not directly linked to a specific amount of collateral.

BIS Review 99/2000
The advantage of the Swedish model is that borrowing can be undertaken without any fixed link to
specific loans. This means that large loans can be put onto the market, which makes it easier to uphold
regular trade and strong liquidity. This has been the case with the Swedish benchmark bonds. Thanks
to significant lending volumes and strong price formation on domestic loans, the mortgage institutions
have also been able to compete successfully on the international bond market.
Borrowing against the entire balance sheet as security requires significant risk capital or some form of
guarantees from the owners. All mortgage institutions, with the exception of SEB Bolån which does
not  does  undertake  borrowing  transactions  in  foreign  currency,  have  a  capital  cover  considerably
above the statutory minimum of 8% (Figure 9).

The Swedish mortgage institutions are currently estimated to borrow around 20% of their capital from
abroad. The major part of this is borrowed from investors in  the  USA  and Japan.  Borrowing  in the
euro area accounts for approximately 20% of borrowing abroad. It is difficult to see that the option of
borrowing in euro would increase central European investors’ interest in Swedish housing bonds. As
long  as  Sweden  is  not  a  member  of  EMU  and  as  long  as  Swedish  borrowers  want  to  borrow  in
Swedish kronor, the foreign exchange risk will remain.
Increasing competition on the mortgage market will entail a greater need for new forms of financing
that  are  more  economical  with  the  institution’s  risk  capital.  Two  financing  forms  being  used
increasingly by foreign mortgage institutions are gilt-edged bonds and securitisation.
Gilt-edged bonds
In Denmark and Germany, mortgages are primarily financed through specially regulated secure bonds.
These secure bonds are mainly housing bonds with clearly defined collateral. Security for this type of
bond is regulated by law and the bonds are subject to strict supervision by authorities.
The German and Danish secure bonds have been given special treatment in EU directives. Under this
special  treatment,  member  states  can  exempt  insurance  companies  and  fund  companies  from  the
normal  requirements  for  spreading  risk  for  these  bonds  and  a  lower  risk  weighting  can  be  applied
when calculating capital adequacy requirements.
The government has instigated an investigation into whether gilt-edged bonds could be introduced in
Sweden. In brief, the proposal means that a priority right would apply for this type of bond, that clear
limits would be defined for the collateral ratio (max 75% for residential property) and that collateral
BIS Review 99/2000

would be identified in a special register controlled by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority.
The proposal is currently being examined by the Ministry of Finance.
The main argument in favour of allowing Swedish mortgage institutions to issue gilt-edged bonds is
that  such  bonds  are  issued  by  European  competitors  and  are  already  established  on  the  market.
Gilt-edged bonds would thereby be easier to sell to investors, would involve higher liquidity and give
lower  interest  rates  than  traditional  Swedish  housing  bonds.  This  would  facilitate  the  mortgage
institutions’ financing and would hopefully result in lower interest rates for consumers.
However,  the  Riksbank  is  critical  towards  the  proposal  on  account  of  the  doubtful  role  that  the
national  supervisory  authority  would  assume  by  taking  responsibility  for  ensuing  that  the  total
collateral for the loan is intact. The supervision of Finansinspektionen may create the impression that
the  government  is  assuming  special  responsibility  for  the  security  of  the  bonds,  and  this  is  not  the
intention.
Special  legislation  on  gilt-edged  bonds  is  likely  to  entail  a  return  to  tighter  market  regulation  as
mortgage institutions would be granted a special status on the capital market. What economic reason
motivates to show favour to a certain group of borrowers?
It is  not  obvious  that  gilt-edged  bonds  would  contribute to  reducing  the  mortgage  institutions’ total
financing  costs.  Gilt-edged  bonds  can  only  be  issued  against  security  up  to  a  certain  limit  of  the
collateral value. It is likely that the remaining stock of non-secured loans will become more expensive
to finance. The use  of  gilt-edged  bonds  may  lead  to lower  financing  costs for the issuing  mortgage
institutions if these institutions do not have to bear the cost of the special supervision that gilt-edged
bonds require.
In my opinion, the increasing competition will promote new forms of funding that make more efficient
use of equity.
Securitisation
One financing form that permits the efficient use of equity is securitisation. Securitisation involves a
given  loan  stock  with  accompanying  collateral  being  taken  off  the  balance  sheet  of  the  mortgage
institution  and  sold  to  a  separate  company  specially  created  for  this  purpose  (known  as  a  special
purpose vehicle). This separate company is then financed through issuing bonds on the market. The
special purpose vehicle has a clearly defined risk scenario and does not pursue any business activities
other  than  acting  as  holder  of  the  specified  loans.  Consequently,  the  company  is  not  subject  to  the
capital adequacy regulations that apply for mortgage institutions.
Securitisation  has  several  advantages,  the  main  one  being  that  it  enables  mortgage  institutions  to
reduce their share of equity  and  thereby  their total financing  cost,  since equity  is a  more  expensive
source  of  financing  than  loan  financing.  Furthermore,  mortgage  institutions  can  streamline  their
operations by selling claims and by specialising in issuing loans. Securitisation can also increase the
stability of the financial system as credit risks can be transferred from institutions subject to regulation
to players that are less sensitive to heavy credit losses.
Securitisation  using  a  special  purpose  vehicle  located  in  Sweden  is  permitted,  but  in  practice  it  is
unprofitable  since,  under  the  current  regulations,  the  special  purpose  vehicle  will  be  subject  to  the
same capital adequacy regulations as the mortgage institutions. A proposal to improve the conditions
for securitisation in Sweden is currently being prepared by the Ministry of Finance. The Budget Bill
for  2001  states  that  the  government  intends  to  put  forward  a  bill  on  improved  conditions  for
securitisation during autumn 2000.
To  date,  three  Swedish  mortgage  institutions,  SBAB,  SEB-Bolån  and  Bokredit  have  undertaken
securitisation  via  special  purpose  vehicles  abroad.  On  five  occasions  between  1990  and  1994,  SEB
securitised  mortgage  loans  totalling  SEK 12  billion,  and  in  June  2000,  the  same  bank  securitised
mortgage 
loans  worth  approximately  SEK 8.5  billion.  SBAB  securitised  mortgages  worth
approximately  SEK  1  billion  in  February  2000  and  loans  worth  approximately  SEK 8  billion  in
October 2000. Bokredit, owned by Den Danske Bank, has securitised a stock of mortgage loans to a
7
BIS Review 99/2000
value of SEK 1.3 billion. A new Internet-based issuer of mortgage loans is Europeloan, which started
up  operations  in  Sweden  in  February  1999.  Europeloan  is  financing  their  internet  based  mortgage
lending by securitisation of the loans abroad, up to now around SEK 0,5 billion.
Objections that have been expressed against securitisation include the fact that up until now it has been
relatively complicated and costly to set up special purpose vehicles, and it has  not  been  possible  to
invest the bonds at such favourable interest rates as their rating would imply. Possible reasons are that
the  market  is  underdeveloped  and  the  issues  have  been  few,  which  has  meant  that  liquidity  in  the
bonds has been low.
Securitisation of mortgages is common in the USA, where around half of the total outstanding loans
stock of secured loans is securitised. In Europe, housing financing has  mainly  taken  other forms.  If
competition in the mortgage market increases as a result of EMU, it is likely that the need to finance
mortgage  loans  as  economically  as  possible  will  also  increase.  Taking  this  into  account,  it  is  not
unreasonable to believe that securitisation will become a more attractive option.
Increased competition can thus lead to a growing market for securitisation. Alternatively, the opposite
may  apply,  ie  that  improved  opportunities  for  securitisation  will  increase  competition.  This  is  what
happened  in  Australia,  where  the  mortgage  market  was  deregulated  during  the  1990s.  Legislation
facilitating  securitisation reduced  the  previously  high  market  entry  barriers,  paved  the  way  for  new
players and reduced costs for borrowers by as much as a couple of percentage points.
Conclusion
Overall,  most  factors  point  to  an  increase  in  competition  on  the  mortgage  market.  New  forms  of
financing, new technology and possible EMU participation will contribute to reducing costs for new
players trying to enter the mortgage market. Since mortgages are standardised products, lenders will
compete on price, ie the rate of interest on the loan. The financing issue will therefore be a decisive
one for issuers of mortgages.
Traditionally,  mortgage  institutions  have  financed  their  operations  by  borrowing  using  their  entire
balance sheet as collateral. This method of financing is relatively expensive for mortgage institutions
and  as  competition  on  the  mortgage  market  increases,  so  will  the  need  for  cheaper  methods  of
financing.
Securitisation and gilt-edged bonds have been discussed as possible methods for mortgage institutions
to reduce their financing costs. Of these two financing methods, securitisation stands out as having the
greatest  potential  for  reducing  financing  costs,  since  securitisation  makes  the  most  efficient  use  of
equity.
