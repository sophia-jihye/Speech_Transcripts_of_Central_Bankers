Lars Heikensten: The Swedish krona and monetary policy
Speech by Mr Lars Heikensten, First Deputy Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, at a seminar of Crédit
Agricole Indosuez, held in Stockholm on 5 September 2001.
 Over the past year the Swedish krona has weakened markedly. Both we at the Riksbank and other
players in the currency market have been surprised by this. In that the exchange rate is an important
factor in our assessments of future inflation, it also plays a part in the direction of monetary policy. The
fact  that,  for  the  first  time  in  years,  the  Riksbank  has  intervened  in  the  currency  market  has  also
contributed to the recent heightening of attention on the exchange rate.
Today  I  shall  first  endeavour  to  clarify  the  krona’s  role  in  the  Riksbank’s  intellectual  framework  for
monetary policy. A policy that targets inflation requires us to forecast the exchange rate, which is my
next  theme  and  by  no  means  an  easy  task.  In  that  context  I  shall  also  say  something  about  the
Riksbank’s  view  of  the  krona’s  long-term  real  equilibrium  exchange  rate  and  its  course  in  the  past
year. Another question I shall be considering is how exchange rate movements affect inflation. Before
concluding, I will also talk a bit about interventions and transparency - a topic that has featured in the
debate since we took the decision in June.
The krona’s role changed in the 1990s
In the period since the fixed exchange rate was abandoned the Riksbank has not targeted the level of
the  krona.  For  monetary  policy  the  primary  consideration  is  how  inflation  prospects  relate  to  the
2 per cent  inflation  target.  But  in  the  Riksbank’s  assessment  of  inflation  the  exchange  rate  is,  of
course, an important factor.
Through  producer  and  consumer  prices  for  imported  goods  and  services,  the  exchange  rate  has  a
direct effect on inflation that normally is comparatively rapid. Moreover, the exchange rate influences
inflationary  pressure  indirectly  and  usually  with  a  longer  lag  via  effects  on  the  level  of  economic
activity.  All  else  equal,  a  weaker  exchange  rate  leads  to  stronger  demand  for  Swedish  goods  and
services  and  thereby  to  rising  resource  utilisation.  The  exchange  rate  can  also  influence  inflation
expectations indirectly, with effects in the first place on price setting.
Since  the  Riksbank  introduced  the  inflation  target,  our  view  of  the  exchange  rate  and  inflation  has
changed by degrees. In the early years with a flexible exchange rate, monetary policy was influenced
a good deal in practice by short-run exchange rate fluctuations. The focus then shifted and today it is
clearer that what matters for monetary policy is the entire path of the exchange rate and inflation in the
coming years.
The monetary  policy reaction  to  a  shift  in  the  exchange  rate  depends  on  the  cause  of  the  shift,  its
perceived duration and the economic situation  in  general.  Exchange  rate  movements  are  not  to  be
considered as isolated events, neither should monetary policy’s reactions to them be mechanical. If a
depreciation  stems  from  an  international  slowdown,  for  example,  the  consequences  for  monetary
policy will differ from a case where the roots lie in a lack of confidence in Sweden’s economic policy.
The situation at the beginning of June can serve as an illustration. The problem was not simply that
the  krona  was  under-valued.  That  had  been  the  case,  though  not  so  dramatically,  for  a  long  time.
What led us to conclude that the situation was sufficiently serious to warrant action was a conjunction
of  several  factors.  The  depreciation  occurred  very  rapidly  and  we  had  not  received  any  new
information  that  justified  such  a  marked  movement.  That  meant  that  the  future,  relatively  optimistic
path for the krona on  which monetary policy  had  been formulated now appeared  less realistic. The
depreciation was, moreover, particularly troublesome in that it coincided with a substantial price rise
and accordingly heightened the risk of inflation expectations shifting to a rate of price increases that
exceeded the Riksbank’s target. The increase  in  inflation  stemmed  both  from  transitory  factors  and
from persistently high resource utilisation.

 Forecasting exchange rates is difficult
As I said, it is the exchange rate’s path in the coming two years that is important for monetary policy.
So how can one arrive at a picture of the exchange rate several years ahead? The central banks that
target inflation can be said to have three main approaches.
• 
One alternative is to assume that the exchange rate will be unchanged during the forecast
period, quite simply to adopt a cut-off rate. This, however, raises a number of problems. As
exchange  rates  are  liable  to  shift  rather  rapidly  and  the  assumed  rate  is  of  considerable
importance for the forecast rate of inflation, this approach may entail sudden changes in the
assessment of inflation and thereby  in  the  repo  rate.  Another  problem  is  the  risk  of  being
trapped in a game situation with the market. So there are sound reasons for not resorting to
a more short-term pattern of reactions. Sooner or later, other central banks have generally
come to the same conclusion.
Another  alternative  is  to  base  an  exchange  rate  forecast  on  market  pricing  or  other
assessments of market expectations. This approach, which is used by a number of central
banks,  reduces  but  does  not  eliminate  the  risks  associated  with  rapid  fluctuations  and
speculation.  Another problem  here  is  that  the  picture  of  expectations  is  liable  to  vary  with
how they are measured. On the other hand, this approach has the advantage of presumably
being most credible in the eyes of market players; it is, after all, based on their assessments!
The Riksbank has chosen a third alternative, which is to make an independent assessment.
Here the initial position - the cut-off rate - is naturally one important component and so are
the  market’s  expectations.  In  addition,  we  consider  other  relevant  information  that  is
available, not least the exchange rate that can be said to be more fundamentally reasonable.
Which  of  these  three  approaches  is  most  appropriate  -  given  that  game  situations  and  the  risk  of
sudden shifts could be disregarded - is not self-evident. Personally I cannot see why we should not
treat the exchange rate in much the same way as other forecast variables. We normally try to consider
all the relevant information that can be gathered on a particular variable. It seems reasonable to do so
in this case, too. Another matter is the considerable degree of uncertainty that surrounds virtually all
forecast variables and particularly the exchange rate. That is why we also produce an assessment of
risks. Our policy is then based on an overall assessment, including a valuation of the various risks.
 Exchange rate theories
It is often said that for the conduct of economic policy, the best help in practice is a good theory. In the
case of exchange rates, however, the relevant theories have not been particularly successful at either
explaining or predicting movements of the Swedish krona or other currencies in recent years.
A basic difficulty with theories for determining exchange rates is the fact that an exchange rate is a
nominal price, whereas economic analysis is constructed to explain relative prices. For that reason,
exchange rate analysis tends to focus on real rates, which in principle are defined as the basket of
goods a particular country has to provide in order to obtain a given basket from abroad. In such an
expression for the real exchange rate, the numerator is usually written as the product of the nominal
exchange  rate  and  a  suitable  price  index  in  foreign  currency  and  the  denominator  as  a  suitable
domestic price index.
A common approach is that the real exchange rate is constant. The term equilibrium is used here to
denote internal balance with full employment and external balance with stable external debt. So with a
fixed  real  equilibrium  exchange  rate,  the  nominal  exchange  rate  is  ultimately  determined  by  the
country’s rate of inflation relative to inflation abroad. If inflation is lower in the rest of the  world, the
nominal exchange rate will depreciate so that the real rate remains constant. This is the doctrine of
purchasing power parity. While it is the most common starting point for determining an exchange rate
in the longer run, the theory is known to be rather poor at explaining nominal exchange rates in both
the short and the medium term.
In practice the real equilibrium exchange rate is liable to be affected by many different factors, two of
which seem particularly self-evident.
Terms  of  trade.  Suppose  that  a  country  exports  cars  and  imports  wine.  A  deterioration  in  terms  of
trade then means that the price of cars falls relative to the price of wine in a common currency. In
2
BIS Review 75/2001
order to be able to sell more cars with a view to buying an unchanged quantity of wine and thereby
leave the balance on current account unchanged, the country’s real exchange rate has to depreciate.
Productivity growth. Suppose instead that the country becomes more efficient at manufacturing cars.
This can lead to better quality cars for a given input of resources and a given price in the domestic
currency. The cars can then command a higher price in the world market and the real exchange rate
can  appreciate.  In  practice,  high  productivity  growth  tends  to  be  associated  with  a  higher  potential
GDP growth rate. In a country where growth is higher than in the rest of the world, the real exchange
rate  can  therefore  be  expected  to  show  an  appreciating  trend.  However,  the  relationship  between
productivity growth and the exchange rate is not stable. Economic theory is not clear cut on this point -
some lines of reasoning could lead to the opposite conclusion.
An additional factor that is closely related to the real exchange rate is the balance on current account.
A succession of current-account deficits leads to growing external debt and rising interest payments.
The real exchange rate must then depreciate if the country is to achieve enough additional exports to
finance the interest payments.
Besides  these  more  fundamental  explanations  with  links  to  the  theory  of  purchasing  power  parity,
there are numerous notions connected more or less closely with the flows in currency markets. The
nominal  exchange  rate  is  the  price  of  a  currency;  like  prices  of  other  goods,  this  price  is  naturally
affected  from  time  to  time  by  more  or  less  temporary  fluctuations  in  demand  and  supply.  It  is
explanations of this type that market players are most prone to put forward for short-run exchange-rate
fluctuations.
The  most  general  flow-related  explanation  is  probably  the  short-term  interest  rate  differential.
Textbooks  teach  that  international  currency  flows  and  nominal  exchange  rates  are  susceptible  to
differences  in  current  and  expected  monetary  policy.  Today,  when  monetary  policy  throughout  the
industrialised world is focused on price stability, so that interest rate differentials between countries are
tending to decrease, the explanatory power of this variable is presumably weaker.
Another factor that has been of major importance for nominal exchange rates from time to time is the
state  of  the  government  finances.  High  and  growing  government  debt  leads  to  expectations  of  a
suspension of payments or a monetary policy realignment in a more inflationary direction. That in turn
results in a depreciation of the exchange rate.
The picture in Sweden
Since 1975 the Swedish krona has  weakened in nominal terms by  as much as 90 per cent. But at
least half of this depreciation can be explained by Sweden’s higher inflation. And in this respect there
has been a decisive change. We now have the same policy commitment to price stability as the rest of
the world.
That leaves around 40 per cent of the depreciation to account for. Our work at the Riksbank suggests
that in the 1970s and ’80s, the major part of the real exchange rate’s weakening can be attributed to
deteriorating terms of trade, low GDP and productivity growth compared with the rest of the world and
growing  external  debt.  One  of  the  models  we  have  used  indicates  that  about  three-quarters  of  the
depreciation  stemmed  from  relatively  poorer  growth  in  Sweden  and  about  a  quarter  to  worsening
terms of trade.
The picture in the 1990s looks different. As far as we can tell at present, in the past decade neither
productivity nor GDP growth has been poorer than in the rest of the world (Fig. 1). So in this respect,
too, there seems to have been a change for the better. It is partly  against this background that the
krona’s persistently weak average path in the latter part of the 1990s is surprising.

In the more recent discussion in the media and on the markets, attention has focused on more specific
flows.  This  discussion  is  not  always  completely  accurate.  One  reason  for  this  is  that  it  is  not  the
individual flows, but rather the complete picture including all of the flows, various currency strategies,
etc. that determines developments. We have little knowledge of the extent to which the players in the
economy take exchange rate positions when they buy and sell various types of securities. We know
from financial theory that large fluctuations in financial prices can often occur without any connection
to large flows.
Concern  about  the  government  finances  can  hardly  have  been  a  crucial  factor  in  the  latter  1990s.
Neither  is  it  probable  that  the  short-term  interest  rate  differential  played  a  sizeable  part,  though  an
effect at times cannot be ruled out.
In the more recent discussion, attention has focused on more specific flows. There were periods last
year,  for  example,  when  the  paths  of  the  Stockholm  stock  exchange  and  the  Swedish  krona  were
rather closely related. It looks as if the krona tended to fall when foreign investors quit the market. The
sizeable  purchases  of  foreign  securities  by  Swedish  investors  have  a  similar  effect;  recently,  these
purchases  have  mirrored  the  opportunities  provided  by  the  new  pension  system.  Flows  that  are
comparatively  small  in  this  context  have  also  been  occasioned  by  the  repayment  of  government
external  debt.  At  the  same  time,  purchases  of  kronor  have  presumably  decreased  in  that  export
receipts  have  fallen  significantly  for  a  number  of  large  companies  this  year  and  big  concerns  have
increased their cash holdings in foreign currency accounts.
Moreover, in recent years increased unrest in the international financial markets has tended to hit the
Swedish krona; this was particularly evident during the financial crisis in autumn 1998. It seems to be
a consequence of a generally heightened aversion to risk in the major financial centres, such as New
York and London. Money is then withdrawn from countries whose currencies and economies took a
beating in similar situations in the past;  since  the  crisis  in  the  early  1990s  Sweden  is  unfortunately
included in this category even though the current macroeconomic situation does not warrant this.
Finally, the generally stronger dollar should be mentioned as a partial explanation for the weak krona.
Many economists consider that according to conventional theory the dollar’s strength is inexplicable
and the dollar is markedly over-valued. In this situation the Swedish krona, like most other currencies
in the OECD area, has depreciated against the dollar.
One problem with explanations of this kind is that they come and go. It is also easy to show that they
lack  universal  validity.  One  currency’s  depreciation  is  attributed  to  a  heavy  dependence  on
commodities at the same time as another’s is said to stem from the opposite, for instance a large IT
4
BIS Review 75/2001
sector. While the Swedish krona has been falling with the stock exchange, both the Swiss franc and
sterling have appreciated, and so on. The explanations are therefore of little value for forecasting.
Under  these  circumstances  it  has  seemed  to  us  that  there  are  good  reasons  for  attaching  major
importance  to  the  available  assessments  of  the  krona’s  more  fundamental  value.  Many  other
observers appear to do the same when they predict an appreciating krona in the somewhat longer run.
It  is  quite  simply  improbable  that  Sweden  can  continue  to  have  large  trade  surpluses  and,  as  a
consequence  of  an  unduly  under-valued  currency,  more  profitable  firms  than  the  rest  of  the  world
without this leading to a reversal of the occasional flows that have recently gone against the krona. In
forecasting  work  and  monetary  policy  decision-making  we  then,  as  I  mentioned  earlier,  have  to
combine  this  assessment  with  risk  scenarios,  so  that  different  risks,  including  the  possibility  of  the
krona being weaker than in the main scenario, are weighed against each other.
Smaller pass-through to consumer prices
As  I  have  indicated,  the  exchange  rate  concerns  us  because  it  influences  inflation.  Since  1993
exchange  rate  fluctuations  have  been  comparatively  marked  but  the  effects  on  price  developments
have been smaller than expected.
Consumer prices for imported goods are dependent on a  variety of  factors.  Besides  exchange  rate
movements, these include the development of world market prices and the level of resource utilisation
in Sweden. The importance of domestic resource utilisation has to do, for example, with the fact that
most  imported  goods  are  handled  and  processed  in  Sweden  before  reaching  consumers  and  that
raising prices is generally more difficult when demand is weak.
When we look back at the 1990s in order to draw conclusions about the future, all these factors have
to be born in mind. Let me cite a couple of examples.
During 1994 and much of 1995 a comparatively weak exchange rate led to rising import prices but the
pass-through to consumer prices was smaller than the Riksbank had anticipated. One explanation was
that  capacity  utilisation  turned  out  to  be  below  the  Riksbank’s  assessment  both  because  it  was
overestimated initially and because demand was weaker, partly as a result of the Riksbank’s interest
rate hikes. Another explanation was the krona’s marked appreciation towards the end of 1995.
In 1998 the krona  weakened again  in connection  with the Russian crisis.  On  a  12-month  basis  the
depreciation  amounted  at  most  to  about  10  per  cent.  Even  so,  import  prices  did  not  rise;  on  the
contrary,  they actually fell  a good  way  into  1999.  This  largely  reflected  the  factor  that  triggered  the
crisis: one of the largest price falls in modern times in commodity markets, including a barrel price of
oil  down  towards  USD  10.  The  result  was  markedly  decreased  international  export  prices  - the
equivalent of our import prices.
A  factor  that  may  have  contributed  to  the  exchange  rate  pass-through  to  consumer  prices  being
smaller  after  the  Asian  and  Russian  crises  is  that  importers  turned  away  from  traditional  trading
partners  in  the  United  States,  for  instance,  in  favour  of  countries  whose  currencies  have  not
appreciated  against  the  krona.  Our  imports  from  Eastern  Europe  and  Southeast  Asia,  for  example,
have increased markedly since 1995.
It is conceivable that the krona’s depreciation at the time of the Asian and Russian crises has been
exaggerated  because  the  TCW  index  measures  the  exchange  rate  against  the  most  important
industrialised countries and uses weights based on export and import shares from 1989-90. In order to
throw  light  on  this,  we  have  constructed  a  simple,  broader  preliminary  import-weighted  index  that
covers 44 countries. The results again show that the krona was weak in 1998 and 1999 but not as
weak  as  the  TCW  index  indicated.  One  reason  why  the  exchange  rate  pass-through  to  consumer
prices became smaller than expected may have to do with changes in the composition of imports.
There are, however, also reasons for supposing that the krona’s direct pass-through to inflation has
decreased.  Simple  estimations  indicate  a  marked  reduction  in  the  early  1990s,  followed  by  some
further fall (Fig. 2). A variety of factors may have contributed to this.
• 
Exchange  rate  movements,  upwards  or  downwards,  may  now  be  perceived  as  a  more
transient  phenomenon,  whereas  the  devaluations  under  the  fixed  exchange  rate  regime
were regarded as more permanent. If importers expect a price change to be temporary, they
will no doubt be more prone to absorb the exchange rate fluctuations in their profit margins.
That this may have been the case is indicated by some preliminary studies.
BIS Review 75/2001

  Generally increased confidence in the low-inflation regime may also have tended to reduce
the exchange rate’s pass-through to inflation. More stable expectations about future inflation
should make prices less volatile.
During the 1990s, moreover, competition in the Swedish economy has generally increased,
for  instance  as  a  consequence  of  EU  membership,  continued  tariff  cuts,  the  reduction  of
other barriers to trade and deregulation of the domestic economy. Increased IT trade and the
advent of new low-cost producers have had a similar effect. Although such changes are of
the  one-off  type,  in  the  past  decade  they  have  affected  a  series  of  markets  and  thereby
presumably had a more protracted effect on the aggregate price level.

The conclusion from all this is that the pass-through from the exchange rate to consumer prices has
probably decreased. At the same, this conclusion should not be taken too far, so that the tendency is
assumed  to  be  permanent.  As  we  have  seen,  there  have  been  periods  when  the  rate  of  price
increases  for  imported  consumer  goods  has  been  held  back  by  other  factors  than  just  an  altered
exchange rate pass-through.
In  a  situation  where  resource  utilisation  is  high,  a  weakening  of  the  exchange  rate  is  no  longer
perceived  as  transient  and  favourable  one-off  effects  have  ceased  to  act,  the  pass-through  from
exchange rate movements can be larger than what we have observed in recent years.
Currency interventions and transparency
Before  concluding,  I  would  like  to  say  something  with  reference  to  the  discussion  that  arose  in
connection with the Riksbank’s currency interventions in June.
First I should underscore that for a number of years now we have taken great pains to be as open and
clear about monetary policy as it is possible to be. I have no qualms about claiming that during the
past five years we have become one of the  world’s most transparent central banks. What we have
achieved in this respect is something of a cultural upheaval. The most recent step, in spring 1999, was
that we began publishing the minutes of the new Executive Board’s monetary policy meetings. As I
have explained in other contexts, transparency and clarity serve several purposes. They can enhance
monetary policy’s credibility and legitimacy. They can also make monetary policy more predictable. In
my opinion, moreover, they have had a favourable effect on the Riksbank’s internal atmosphere and
efficiency.
6
BIS Review 75/2001
As regards currency market interventions, we should likewise naturally aim to be as open and distinct
as possible. The arguments about credibility and legitimacy apply here as well. There is also reason to
believe that interventions will be more successful if they are perceived as a monetary policy signal,
with  information about  the central bank’s assessment of price developments and  thereby  the  future
path of the instrumental rate.
When the Riksbank intervened last June we made a point of demonstrating that the measure’s context
was  monetary  policy.  The  measure  was  announced  and  communicated  in  speeches  by  Urban
Bäckström and myself. At the time of the first intervention, moreover, the Executive Board issued a
press notice and Urban Bäckström took part in a broadcast interview in which a good deal of time was
devoted to this issue.
The degree of openness was also substantial in the sense that we informed our counterparties that
the interventions had been made and confirmed this when questions were asked. Moreover, the size
of the interventions could be calculated later from the weekly publications of the Riksbank’s balance
sheet.  So  on  this  occasion  we  were  more  transparent  and  distinct  than  is  customary  with  currency
interventions, compared both with our earlier record and with most other central banks.
We  did,  however,  depart  from  the  customary  procedure  in  one  respect.  The  Executive  Board’s
monetary  policy  decisions  are  normally  recorded  in  separate  minutes  that  are  published  about  a
fortnight  later. We  have  chosen  not  to  publish  any  minutes  after  the  interventions.  This  is  primarily
because,  as  a  monetary  policy  instrument,  the  effective  implementation  of  interventions  is  a
considerably more complex matter than a repo rate decision. As you know, a central bank does not
control the currency market in the same way as the market for overnight loans. By setting the repo
rate,  the  Riksbank  determines  interest  rates  in  the  market,  whereas  in  currency  interventions  the
Riksbank  is  one  of  many  players.  Releasing  information  that  might  weaken  the  Riksbank’s  market
position is therefore a problem.
Preparations for a currency intervention normally include, for example, a strategy for the intervention’s
size,  the  criteria  for  how  and  when  the  interventions  should  be  made,  the  choice  of  currencies,
deliberations  about  counterparties  and  contacts  with  other  central  banks.  In  my  view,  it  would  not
under normal circumstances be reasonable to publish this type of operative deliberation. That might
prejudice the possibility of achieving the approved or envisaged goal.
Another  question  concerns  the  Executive  Board’s  position  on  the  publication  of  minutes  when  the
Board’s discussion has more to do with matters of principle, including information about the views of
individual members. This, too, is a complex issue because information of this type can also affect the
effectiveness of the measures that are taken. One possibility I consider worth testing would be to wait
for  some  months  before  the  Board  evaluates  the  measures  comprehensively  and  publishes  more
detailed minutes. This, in any event, is a matter to which the Board intends to return later this autumn
with the aim of establishing a procedure for preparing these matters and providing information about
them in ways that are appropriate to the current exchange rate regime. At the same time, it should be
underscored  that  the  arrangements  we  lay  down  will  not  be  set  in  concrete.  There  must  be  some
latitude for unforeseen circumstances. It is worth mentioning that when the Executive Board came into
being in January 1999 and chose to work with public minutes, the interval before they were published
was comparatively long, 6 to 8 weeks. Since then it has proved possible to reduce the lag to only a
fortnight without giving rise to serious detrimental effects.
Conclusion
The  main  message  in  my  address  today  has  been  that  in  the  current  monetary  policy  regime  the
exchange rate ought to be regarded mainly as one of a number of forecast variables. The problem
here is that, like other currencies, the Swedish krona is difficult to forecast in the time perspective that
is  relevant  for  monetary  policy,  namely  a  couple  of  years  ahead.  The  situation  is  complicated,
moreover,  in  that  the  exchange  rate  is  a  variable  that  in  certain  situations  monetary  policy  can
conceivably affect directly. We try to use all the available information in order to arrive at our forecast.
At the same time, the monetary policy decision is reached in the light of other, alternative paths for the
exchange rate.
In  the  course  of  the  last  three  decades  the  krona  has  depreciated.  The  main  causes  have  been
Sweden’s higher inflation and lower growth. Since the realignment of Sweden’s economic policy in the
early 1990s, these factors no longer apply.
BIS Review 75/2001

The fact that, on average, the krona has been under-valued in the 1990s has not posed such large
problems for monetary policy as might have been expected. Various factors have helped to limit the
pass-through to inflation. However, some of these factors cannot be seen as permanent. For instance,
resource utilisation is likely to be higher than during the decade that followed the crisis of 1990-92.
Interventions are an instrument the Riksbank has used very sparsely in recent  years. Today I  have
only commented very briefly on our reasons for acting in the early summer. I have had more to say
about my view of transparency in connection with interventions. Although, as usual in the context of
monetary  policy,  there  are  grounds  for  striving  for  a  high  degree  of  openness  and  clarity,  the
comparison  with  repo  rate  decisions  does  not  really  hold.  In  the  case  of  currency  interventions  the
Riksbank is a minor player and it is difficult for our ambitions to have an impact. This must be borne in
mind  in  the  autumn  when  we  establish  a  procedure  for  preparing  for  and  informing  about  currency
interventions.
