 Lars Heikensten: Some topical monetary policy issues 
Speech  by  Mr  Lars  Heikensten,  First  Deputy  Governor  of  Sveriges  Riksbank,  at  a  seminar  of  the 
SNS - Center for Business and Policy Studies, Stockholm, 23 October 2001. 
 Thank you for inviting me to talk here about monetary policy and the economic situation. 
The economic seminars arranged by the Centre for Business and Policy Studies are an established 
tradition that is well worth maintaining. This is my sixth appearance here as Deputy Governor of the 
Riksbank and for me, these have been good occasions both for looking back and reflecting on all that 
has happened in the field of monetary policy during the past year and for considering what the future 
may have in store. My talk today is arranged along similar lines. 
From  the  viewpoint  of  economic  policy  and  in  keeping  with  the  latter  part  of  the  1990s,  last  year’s 
economic developments gave relatively little cause for concern. GDP growth had provided a series of 
pleasant  surprises  at  the  same  time  as  inflation  had  been  lower  than  expected.  This  had  been 
accompanied by a rapid improvement in the public finances. 
Signs of poorer tendencies were, however, beginning to appear. Stock markets were already starting 
to fall in the early part of 2000 and in the late autumn a number of indicators pointed to an economic 
slowdown, first in the United States and then, early this year, in other parts of the world. To begin with 
this was perceived as just a temporary dip - a blip in the stocks cycle, a minor adjustment in the IT 
sector or something else. But stock markets seemed to be clearly over-valued and it would have been 
odd,  particularly  after  such  a  long  upward  phase,  if  this  had  not  led  to  a  certain  amount  of  over-
investment.  There  were  also  clear  signs  of  insufficient  saving,  particularly  in  the  United  States. 
Consequently there were grounds for believing that once a slowdown had started, it could prove to be 
both relatively deep and long. Against this background, in the March Inflation Report we talked not so 
much about a V-shaped path as a U-shaped one or a “banana”. Since then the outlook has become 
darker but more of that later. 
For monetary policy, turns in the business cycle are  not inherently  a major problem, apart from the 
difficulty  of  foreseeing  them.  Falling  resource  utilisation,  for  example,  should  normally  led  to  lower 
inflation in the future. That in turn can pave the way for interest rate cuts. In the past year, however, 
things have not been quite as simple as that. Two partly interrelated factors have contributed to this. 
One  is  inflation,  which  has  been  higher  than  expected  and  also  above  our  target.  The  other  is  the 
exchange  rate,  which  has  been  weaker  than  anticipated  and  also  weaker  than  the  real  economy 
warrants.  During  a  period  in  the  late  spring,  moreover,  the  krona  fell  rather  uncontrollably  in  the 
absence  of  similar  movements  in  other  currencies.  All  this  has  made  our  work  harder  than  in  the 
preceding years. 
Price tendencies 
I should like to comment first on the high inflation figures. 
Fluctuations in inflation are commonplace 
Recently people have been asking whether the higher inflation outcomes constitute a failure. Some 
years ago, when inflation month after month, not to say year after year, turned out to be lower than we 
had predicted and below our 2 per cent target, people asked exactly the same thing. I did not see it on 
the whole as a failure then and neither do I do so now. The lower inflation at that time was mainly due 
to  downward  effects  of  a  transitory  nature  even  though  the  economy  was  expanding  rapidly  and 
capacity  utilisation  was  rising.  Similarly,  the  higher  rates  at  present  primarily  stem  from  transitory 
factors. Earlier we noted that some upward shift in inflation could be achieved in the short run but only 
by means of drastic interest rate cuts. The corresponding remedy today would be drastic hikes. Such 
an approach would make interest rate policy erratic and result in unnecessary fluctuations in economic 
activity. 
What we can do - and do - is to aim consistently at our 2 per cent target. There is then a good chance 
of succeeding in the longer run, particularly if economic agents take us at our word and rely on future 
inflation  being  in  line  with  earlier  assessments.  Judging  from  the  various  indicators  of  inflation

 expectations,  on  the  whole  we  seem  to  have  been  successful  (Diagram  1).  Although  inflation  has 
actually fluctuated markedly, for a number of years money market players, for example, have counted 
on future inflation being approximately 2 per cent. Neither have they been greatly mistaken. Since we 
began  to  target  inflation,  the  rate  measured  by  the  CPI  has  averaged  1.3  per  cent,  while  UND1X 
inflation has averaged 1.8 per cent.

If we have anything to reproach ourselves for, perhaps it is that, despite our efforts to the contrary, we 
seem to have induced many segments of society to believe that we can fulfil the target, if not always 
then almost so. That is evidently not the case. Inflation fluctuates, sometimes a lot. The same seems 
to apply in most other relatively small countries. Compare inflation in, for instance, the individual euro 
countries with the average rate in the European Union. In Sweden’s case the fluctuations are possibly 
accentuated  by  the  price-setting  being  comparatively  centralised  in  some  important  respects,  for 
instance the labour market and rents.

Still, there are good reasons for taking a close look at the latest inflation outcomes. The prise rise has 
come mainly from food and energy but also from telecom prices (Diagram 2). In the case of food and 
electricity,  the  price  increases,  particularly  during  the  spring,  largely  stemmed  from  factors  on  the 
supply side: foot-and-mouth disease, mad cow disease, a relatively dry winter, production problems at 
oil  refineries  and  so  on.  It  is,  in  fact,  these  CPI  items  that  normally  fluctuate  most.  It  is  not  just  a 
2 
 BIS Review 89/2001
 coincidence that in Canada, for example, the inflation index that primarily guides monetary policy does 
not include either food or energy prices. The rather large price fluctuations that are a normal feature of 
these  goods  and  services  can  be  taken  to  indicate  that  the  recent  increases  do  not  constitute  a 
ketchup effect, so that the conditions for a return to a rate in line with the target should be relatively 
good. 
Not just transitory effects 
At the same time I definitely do not want to make light of the increase in inflation. Even excluding the 
goods and services I just mentioned, inflation has moved up more than expected and it has done so 
even though resource utilisation is lower, at least at present, that we counted on earlier. That is the 
main reason why, in the latest Inflation Report, we have slightly revised our appraisal of how resource 
utilisation is likely to affect inflation. 
A conceivable interpretation of the revision is that today we consider that resource utilisation last year 
was higher than we reckoned on earlier. That is not self-evident, however; this year’s wage outcomes 
have  been  lower,  which  one  would  not  expect  if  resources  have  been  more  strained.  Another 
possibility is that, even if resource utilisation was not in fact higher, price increases have occurred due 
to insufficient competition. 
In the past, the Riksbank has presented a picture of goods and services divided into those that are 
priced in a market as opposed to administratively. This showed that in 1996-97, for instance, goods 
and  services  priced  administratively  kept  inflation  up  even  though  resource  utilisation  was  falling 
(Diagram  3).  Perhaps  we  are  now  seeing  a  similar  phenomenon.  When  turnover  in  a  competitive 
market falls, prices normally decline, too, but in some respects the opposite now seems to apply. Local 
authorities, for instance, are trying to make up for a loss of tax revenue by raising prices for water, 
public  transport  and  the  like.  From  the  media  it  looks  as  though  there  is  a  similar  tendency  in  civil 
aviation authorities and some air transport, for example.

The  Riksbank  has  no  direct  cause  to  regard  administratively  determined  price  increases  differently 
from market increases: both contribute to inflation. But when the former accompany declining resource 
utilisation,  it  obviously  complicates  matters  for  monetary  policy.  In  addition,  these  observations 
naturally raise other questions that have to be dealt with, not by the Riksbank but by parliament and 
the local authorities and have to do with competitive conditions in the Swedish economy.

 The exchange rate 
Recently  the  exchange  rate  has  also  been  the  subject  of  a  lively  discussion.  That  is  only  to  be 
expected when the krona has fluctuated markedly, besides being clearly under-valued on the whole in 
recent years. 
Differences in inflation and growth could previously explain most things 
In a longer perspective there are explanations for a large part of the krona’s depreciation. In the past 
three  decades  the  nominal  exchange  rate  has  weakened  about  90  per  cent.  More  than  half  of  this 
deterioration can be attributed to the higher inflation in Sweden compared with the rest of the world in 
the 1970s and ’80s. Mostly of the remaining part of the real deprecation can be explained in terms of 
relative GDP growth and worsening terms of trade in the same period. But neither of these two factors 
is relevant to the period since 1992 with a flexible exchange rate: inflation, growth and terms of trade 
have been at least on a par with the rest of the world. 
Various flows may have played a part in the short run. Looking back, it is evident that export growth 
and rapidly rising Swedish share prices may have contributed to the high exchange rate with the euro 
twelve  to  eighteen  months  ago.  During  the  past  year  the  opposite  has  applied.  Another  factor  has 
been large investments in foreign shares when earlier barriers to risk diversion were removed from the 
pension system. In September there was also general financial unrest. However, variables such  as 
these have proved to be of little value for forecasting. 
So  personally  I  do  not  think  it  has  always  been  hard  to  understand  the  direction,  upwards  or 
downwards, of exchange rate movements in recent years. It is the tendency for the krona’s average 
value to be unduly low that has been more difficult to interpret. To some extent, this has presumably 
been a consequence of the American dollar being generally over-valued against European currencies. 
I  also  believe  that  some  part  may  have  been  played  by  various  structural  factors,  for  example  the 
construction  of  the  tax  system,  the  internationalisation  of  the  corporate  sector  with  the  attendant 
relocation of certain functions, the status of the Swedish krona as the importance of the euro grows in 
Europe and so on. 
Some of these notions are supported both by arguments from principle and by somewhat anecdotal 
information. There is reason to believe, for instance, that the taxation of both capital gains and wealth 
has had effects. Moreover, at least a part of the residual item in the statistics could have to do with a 
tendency for firms not to repatriate export receipts to the same extent as before, which in turn may be 
a consequence of a larger proportion of their central functions now being located abroad. But we do 
not know how quantitatively important these factors are and I believe that perhaps one should be wary 
of exaggerating them. Still, these are questions that deserve further scrutiny and we intend to pursue 
them. To date we have published a report on EMU’s conceivable importance for the Swedish krona; 
the conclusion was: not much, provided - and it is a major proviso - Sweden provides equal conditions 
in other respects for wealth formation and business enterprise. 
The krona’s part in the assessment of inflation has varied 
One of the topics in the discussion during the past six months has been how the Riksbank reacts to 
the exchange rate in the formation of monetary policy. We have been accused of being indistinct or 
dithery during the summer and autumn. First let me say that there is a pattern to this that I find familiar. 
Conducting and interpreting monetary policy is more difficult when the situation is appreciably affected 
by other factors than resource utilisation, for instance the exchange rate or inflation expectations. The 
assessments  are  then  more  complex  and  the  Riksbank  faces  greater  educational  challenges.  The 
decisions  also  tend  to  be  more  controversial  because  there  is  a  clearer  conflict  between  different 
goals, so that more criticism is only to be expected. 
Our forecasts are always based on a variety of factors. A traditional model for determining inflation in 
the context of a Phillips curve, for example, points to resource utilisation, inflation expectations and the 
exchange  rate  as  central  components.  However,  these  variable’s  relative  importance  for  inflation 
changes over time.

 Last  December,  when  it  still  looked  as  though  resources  would  continue  to  become  increasingly 
strained, we were concerned about the exchange rate and its effects on prices. We counted on GDP 
growth rates last year and this of 4 and 3.5 per cent, respectively. Since then our appraisal of resource 
utilisation has changed a good deal. We now know that last year’s growth stopped at 3.6 per cent and 
for  this  year  we  are  counting  on  1.3  per  cent.  This  means  that  as  a  percentage  of  GDP,  resource 
utilisation  at  the  end  of  2001  will  be  between  2  and  3  points  lower,  which  is  a  marked  downward 
revision.  Another aspect is that the slowdown is connected  with a  weak tendency  in the rest of the 
world. Consequently our assessment of international export prices has also been revised downwards 
and this, too, counters the inflationary impact of the weaker exchange rate. So although we continue 
to point to the weak krona as an inflation risk, this risk now seems to be smaller, mainly in view of the 
downward revisions of capacity utilisation. 
In June we had some additional factors to consider. The krona suddenly weakened dramatically in the 
absence  of a general  increase  in financial  unrest. This suggested that the causes were specific for 
Sweden. As inflation had moved up appreciably more than expected in the previous months, this was 
particularly troublesome. Although a large  part  of the increased  inflation  was  presumably transitory, 
the Riksbank perceived a risk of higher inflation expectations. Rather than take that risk, we decided to 
raise the interest rate and intervene in the currency market. 
The forecast 
In conclusion I want to make some brief remarks about the future, using our latest Inflation Report as 
the chief starting point. The main scenario there is based on the prospect of what might be called a 
normal cyclical development, driven above all by an international recovery, good disposable incomes 
and a relatively weak exchange rate (Diagram 5).

Unchanged appraisal of the krona’s fundamental value 
Our assessment of the future exchange rate is somewhat less optimistic than before. This has to do 
not so much with new information as with the weak tendency in the past year. In the case of a variable 
that is so notoriously difficult to predict, the assumption about the future is always partly educational. A 
major  aim  on  this  occasion  was  to  avoid  an  assessment  of  inflation  that  could  be  perceived  as 
unrealistic. But the krona fluctuates sooner than the time it takes to revise our forecast, as is clear from 
what has happened.  
In the discussion that followed the publication of the Inflation Report it has been suggested that the 
Riksbank  has  lost  faith  in  the  krona.  I  think  that’s  overdoing  it.  And  regardless  of  the  forecast  we 
presented,  I  see  no  strong  reasons  for  altering  the  appraisal  of  what  is  a  reasonable  fundamental 
exchange rate in the long run, any more than there were grounds for revising the basic principles for 
share valuation just because stock markets had shot up to record levels a couple of years ago. That 
does not mean that some time in the future there could be a case for a different opinion about the 
exchange rate’s reasonable level in relation to the real economy. But that would stem in turn from an 
altered  view  of  Sweden’s  relative  production  potential,  terms  of  trade  or  some  other  fundamental 
variable.  In  this  context  it  should  be  borne  in  mind  that  an  unduly  weak  exchange  rate  generates 
effects that should favour an appreciation further ahead: the balance of trade continues to be strong, 
corporate profits become higher than elsewhere, making Swedish shares more attractive, and so on. 
Calculations of the krona’s fundamental value will no doubt become topical at the latest if Sweden is to 
adopt the euro and we require a picture of the exchange rate that will be serviceable in the longer run. 
Experience  has  shown  that  once  such  rates  have  been  communicated,  they  guide  the  market  to  a 
high degree up to entry. 
Lower resource utilisation but large risks in both directions 
In  the  Report  we  count  on  inflation  falling  back  again  next  spring.  This  year’s  appreciably  lower 
resource  utilisation  has  a  lot  to  do  with  that  but  so  does  the  prospect  of  last  spring’s  rapid  price 
increases coming to an end so that the earlier effects drop out. In the latter part of the forecast period 
inflationary pressure in the main scenario becomes somewhat stronger as the economy recovers fairly 
rapidly.

 BIS Review 89/2001
 Support for this picture is to be found if one goes behind the price statistics and looks at wages and 
unit  labour  costs  (Diagram  6).  Even  with  the  rather  substantial  downward  revision  of  productivity 
growth, these costs rise at a moderate rate throughout the forecast period. That should ensure that 
even  if  inflation  does  not  fall  back  quite  as  much  as  calculated,  its  level  will  be  low.  The  overall 
assessment  is  that  in  September  next  year  CPI  and  UND1X  inflation  will  1.5  and  1.7  per  cent, 
respectively, while the rates in September 2003 will be 2.1 and 2.0 per cent.

The main downside risks are connected, for example, with the possibility that the adjustment in the 
United  States  after  the  long  upward  phase  could  take  longer  than  expected.  After  September  11, 
moreover, terrorist attacks and military action can clearly cause developments to take very different 
paths,  with  markedly  divergent  outcomes  for  the  global  economy.  Another  aspect  is  the  highly 
expansionary direction that economic policy has now taken in many countries,  not least  Sweden.  If 
confidence  in the future  is restored, the table is really  laid for a quick upturn.  But all in  all, there  is 
considered to be a strong probability of inflation being lower as a result of the slowdown abroad being 
deeper  and  more  protracted.  Such  a  development  would  be  likely  to  lengthen  the  slowdown  in 
Sweden as well. 
There are also risks of inflation being higher than in the main scenario. One has to do with the fact that 
inflation  has  risen  more  than  expected.  Our  main  scenario  makes  some  allowance  for  the  higher 
outcomes but the revision is rather small. It was just with such small, cautious revisions that we coped 
with the surprisingly good inflation outcomes earlier. Without more knowledge it is difficult to see how 
one can act very differently. In addition to the marginal revision in the main scenario, the risk spectrum 
now contains a further upside component. Another upside risk for inflation lies in the exchange rate, 
even though a persistently weak currency is presumably the most likely alternative in conjunction with 
slacker economic activity and thereby lower resource utilisation. 
There  are  always  grounds  for  highlighting  the  spectrum  of  risks  as  an  important  element  in  our 
assessment. I want to end by emphasising this particularly at present. In many respects the situation is 
unusually difficult to assess. It is easy to see that developments could quickly take a different turn from 
the  main  scenario.  That  in  turn  could  led  to  interest  rates  becoming  either  higher  or  lower  than  at 
present.
