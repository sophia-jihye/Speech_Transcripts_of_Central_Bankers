 Lars Heikensten: Monetary policy and potential growth 
Speech  by  Mr  Lars  Heikensten,  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  to  the  Swedish  Economics 
Association, Stockholm, 28 March 2003. 
 Let me begin by thanking you for the invitation to come here to the economic association. As a former 
secretary of this association it is a particular pleasure to be invited here. 
My intention today is to discuss a broader question than I normally have reason to take up, namely the 
Swedish economy's capacity for long-term growth. The greater the economy's capacity for long-term 
growth, the better the development in welfare. And here I am not thinking merely of material aspects, 
but also of the possibilities of providing young people with a good education, elderly people with good 
quality care and the environment with a long-term sustainable development. 
The long-term potential growth rate is also important for monetary policy. A high potential growth rate 
allows the economy to grow rapidly without inflation accelerating. 
I  shall  begin  with  a  brief  description  of  the  intellectual  framework  the  Riksbank uses  with  regard  to 
potential  growth and how this affects the shaping of monetary policy.  After that, I shall  discuss two 
factors determining potential growth, namely productivity and labour supply. Finally, I shall round off 
with  some  conclusions.  My  hope  is  to  be  able  to  contribute  to  initiating  continued  discussions  and 
in-depth analyses in this field, both among researchers and more policy-oriented economists. 
The Riksbank’s intellectual framework 
According to the textbook model of macro economics, there is a level of production (GDP) that keeps 
the economy in balance, i.e. actual and expected inflation are in line with the target level, profit shares 
and wages are stable, etc. This level of production is often called the potential or long-term sustainable 
level of production. Despite the fact that the economy is balanced, the potential production level does 
not  remain  constant;  it  normally  grows  over  time.  The  reason  is,  quite  simply,  that  technical 
developments enable a higher production level to be achieved  with the same amount of production 
factors, and that the production factors themselves often show an increase trend. 
The actual inflation rate can deviate from the target rate (and the expected rate) if the production level 
of  the  economy,  for  some  reason,  deviates  from  the  potential  level.  It  is  often  said  that  there  is  a 
positive or a negative production gap. A positive production gap means that the actual production is 
higher than the potential level. In this case, of course, the resource situation is strained; bottlenecks 
begin to arise in the economy. The reverse applies with a negative production gap. 
As the production gap is usually seen as a measure of the demand pressure in the economy and the 
demand pressure in turn affects inflation, monetary policy is in many respects a case of choosing a 
steering  interest  rate  that  will  lead  to  the  smallest  possible  production  gap.  If  the  production  gap  is 
completely closed and equal to zero - i.e. actual and potential production coincide - the inflation rate 
should  be  2  per  cent  as  long  as  a  credible  policy  is  pursued  and  no  other  shocks  occur.  Figure  1 
illustrates in principle possible future developments. 
An  important  insight  in  this  context  is  that  changes  in  the  steering  interest  rate  are  significant  for 
production  and  employment  in  the  short  term,  but  not  in  the  long  term.  If  prices  and  wages  do  not 
adapt  immediately  -  i.e.  there  are  nominal  lags  -  changes  in  nominal  quantities,  including  the 
Riksbank's repo rate, will entail changes in relative prices and real wages. These real price changes 
affect  the  economy's  real  aggregated  demand  and  thereby  both  production  and  employment.  If,  for 
instance,  wage  agreements  are  signed  for  longer  periods  of  time,  while  companies'  pricing  is  more 
flexible, lowering the steering interest rate can have real economy effects in the short term, because 
companies'  price  increases  will  lead  to  lower  real  wages  and  higher  profits  and  thereby  increased 
production  and  employment.  In  the  longer  term,  when  new  wage  agreements  are  signed  wage 
formation will take into account the higher price increases and be adapted to avoid changes in real 
wages. 
By changing the steering interest rate, the Riksbank can affect the actual, short-term production level 
but  not  the  potential,  long-term  level.  The  latter  is  determined,  as  I  said  earlier,  by  factors  such  as

 technological developments, labour supply, etc. On the other hand, it is probable that monetary policy 
can  indirectly,  by  contributing  to  a  more  stable  economic  development,  create  better  conditions  for 
good growth in the long term. 
Reliable assessments of the potential growth capacity of the Swedish economy are very important for 
successful conducting monetary policy. Given this, it is perhaps not so surprising that we have spent a 
significant amount of our time in recent years making analyses of issues related to economic growth. 
This is demonstrated in our working report series, which contains a relatively large number of studies 
on this subject. 
A complicating factor with regard to studies of potential growth is that they entail a quantity that cannot 
be directly observed and measured, but has to be estimated indirectly with the aid of another method. 
There  are  a  number  of  statistical  methods  for  this,  each  of  which  has  both  advantages  and 
disadvantages.  The  estimated  results  have  proved  to  be  relatively  sensitive  to  the  method  applied. 
This in turn means that there is good reason not to fasten on one individual method, but to use several 
methods and thereby increase the reliability of the estimates. At the Riksbank we apply three different 
methods for calculating the production gap and we regularly show and discuss the results of these in 
our  Inflation  Reports  (Figure  2).  Before  we  make  our  final  assessment,  on  which  we  base  our 
monetary  policy,  we  also  weigh  in  other  information  on  resource  utilisation,  for  instance  from  the 
National  Institute  of  Economic  Research's  business  tendency  surveys  or  from  publications  of 
shortages in the labour market. This can also be a good idea as the macro data that forms a basis for 
the  method-based  estimates,  such  as  GDP  growth,  is  often  changed  afterwards  as  a  result  of 
revisions to statistics. The most recent revisions have led, for instance, to an upward adjustment in 
both GDP and productivity for the greater part of the 1990s. 
The development of productivity and the labour supply 
I implied in my introductory discussion that the potential growth capacity of the economy is determined 
by the constant developments in technology that occur in a market economy and by the trend increase 
in production factors. A central element in  this context is the labour productivity  trend measured as 
GDP per hour worked. This increases through technological progress (e.g. as machines become more 
modern) or through the addition of real capital (a long-term extension of the production apparatus). If 
the labour supply itself also shows a change trend over time, this must be taken into  account. The 
potential growth rate of the economy can therefore be calculated as the total historical growth in labour 
productivity  and  labour  supply.  As  I  will  soon  show,  however,  it  is  often  difficult  even  afterwards  to 
distinguish lasting trends from those of a more temporary nature, e.g. those caused by fluctuations in 
economic activity. This applies both to the development of productivity and the labour supply. At the 
same time, distinguishing between processes that are lasting and those of a temporary nature is one 
of  the  most  important  aspects  with  regard  to  the  discussion  of  a  country's  capacity  for  long-term 
growth. 
Let us then study the determining factors one by one. 
Signs of a better growth in productivity 
My  third  slide  shows  the  development  of  labour  productivity,  measured  as  GDP  per  hour  worked, 
together with an estimated trend (Figure 3). 
We see  that  productivity  growth  varies  strongly,  but  also  that  it  shows  a  tendency  to  increase  over 
time, particularly during the 1990s. This is a marked difference compared with  developments in the 
1970s, when the trend was instead a downward one. During the 1980s the actual productivity growth 
levelled  out  at  a  low  level  and  was  often  around  1  per  cent  or  below  -  with  the  exception  of  a  few 
individual  years.  During  the  1990s,  on  the  other  hand,  there  was  a  rapid  increase  and  productivity 
growth stabilised at a level above 2 per cent.  
We don't know exactly what was the driving force behind this development. But allow me nevertheless 
to indicate some factors that may have played an important role. 
The economic crisis at the beginning of the 1990s probably played a not so insignificant role in raising 
productivity growth during the first half of the 1990s. During the crisis years production with a low level 
of productivity was put out of business and unemployment increased which led to an increase in the 
labour productivity measured. This one-off effect raised the level of productivity growth but at the same 
time meant that a large percentage of society's available resources was not utilised.

 BIS Review 16/2003
 In connection with and directly after the crisis there were also a number of changes in the Swedish 
economy  that  have  affected  developments  since  then.  New  regulations  were  established  for  fiscal 
policy,  with  an  expenditure  ceiling  and  surplus  target.  At  the  same  time,  monetary  policy  was 
successfully  aimed  at  safeguarding  low  inflation.  Also  during  the  1990s  a  number  of  markets  were 
deregulated and opened to domestic and international competition. In addition, Sweden joined the EU. 
This development entails an increased international integration of product and labour markets, which 
should have had a favourable effect on productivity growth. 
A further explanation is the shifting between sectors in the Swedish economy. During the 1960s and 
1970s there was a rapid growth in employment in the public sector, while the private sector declined. 
Following the crisis at the beginning of the 1990s the situation was reversed (Figure 4). As productivity 
growth  in  the  public  sector  is  probably  lower  than  productivity  growth  in  the  private  sector,  this 
development results in a rise in productivity for the economy as a whole. These effects are reinforced 
by  the  fact  that  the  National  Accounts  are  based  on  the  calculation  assumption  that  there  is  no 
productivity increase in the public sector at all. 
During  the  second  half  of  the  1990s  in  particular,  there  was  a  rapid  development  in  information 
technology,  which  entailed  greater  efficiency  in  knowledge  transfer  between  individuals  and 
companies and between companies. The expansion of the IT sector was one of the corner-stones of 
this "new economy". The effect this actually had on productivity has been much discussed. It is clear 
that the IT sector itself, and in particular the telecom industry, was responsible for a significant part of 
productivity  growth  at  the  end  of  the  1990s.  Developments  were  very  uneven  among  the  different 
industries, with the increase in productivity in "IT user" industries being much less impressive, despite 
large investments in IT products, than that in the "IT producer" sector. 
The latter is also clearly illustrated when the productivity increase in trade and industry is adjusted for 
the  increase  that  took  place  in  the  telecom  industry  (Figure  5).  When  this  sector  is  excluded, 
productivity during the second half of the 1990s increased by only 1.9 per cent a year, compared with 
2.8 per cent if the sector is included. The telecom sector has now greatly declined in importance and 
there is apparent confusion over its future development. 
The important question for the Riksbank is what all  of this entails for the development of long-term 
productivity growth in future. The figure shows that the trend increase has not been as large at the end 
of the 1990s as during the period up to 1995. It should also be remembered that the method used to 
calculate the trend  has the characteristic that  it reflects changes  in the  actual underlying  trend  at a 
slower  rate.  In  addition,  the  very  high  rates  of  increase  for  productivity  during  the  latter  part  of  the 
1990s reflected both a relatively rapid growth in the private sector relative to the public sector and a 
strong growth in the IT-producing sectors, particularly the telecom industry. It is not likely that future 
developments will follow the same paths. Nevertheless, there are many indications that the long-term 
increase in productivity now is higher than it was during the 1970s and 1980s. Factors in favour of this 
are the fairly comprehensive changes that took place during the 1990s, particularly the introduction of 
the new stabilisation policy regime and a greater degree of openness in the Swedish economy. 
Labour supply a major cause for concern 
Let us now move on to study how the labour supply has developed during the same period of time. My 
next slide shows the actual growth and trend for the number of hours worked (Figure 6). To begin with, 
one can conclude that developments have been relatively adverse during the greater part of the 1980s 
and 1990s. According to the trend, we can actually only detect an increase during the second half of 
the 1990s, which was broken recently both due to economic activity and to more structural causes. 
Several factors lie behind this development.  
Once again it is natural to go back to the crisis years in the early 1990s. At that point the number of 
hours worked declined significantly as a result of the large fall in demand that took place. Parallel with 
this,  structural  changes  were  implemented.  Young  people  on  the  verge  of  working  life  chose  to 
continue  studying,  partly  because  of  the  lack  of  jobs,  partly  because  developments  on  the  labour 
market  meant  that  higher  educational  demands  were  made.  Another  explanation  could  be  that  the 
number of older persons in the labour force also declined considerably during the same period. The 
labour supply in the age group 60-64  years fell by approximately 40,000 persons during the 1990s, 
despite the fact that this group's percentage of the population did not change significantly. In addition, 
the number of people taking early retirement increased at an alarming rate. Recently, as we are all 
aware, the amount of sick leave has increased. 
BIS Review 16/2003

 Another factor that appears to have had some significance is that the Swedish labour market has not 
been  able  to  make  adequate  use  of  the  labour  reserve  comprised  of  inhabitants  who  were  born 
abroad. The employment frequency among these people has been much lower than the employment 
frequency among people born in Sweden. This applies in particular to those who have arrived here 
quite  recently.  The  efficiency  in  matching  on  the  labour  market  also  appears  to  be  lower  for  these 
people. One indication of this is that many with a university education are either unemployed or have 
jobs below their competence levels. 
Contrary  to  what  many  people  believe,  however,  demographic  developments  have  been  relatively 
favourable during the 1990s, from a labour force perspective. The population growth in the age group 
20-64 years developed weakly during the entire 1970s and most of the years up to the 1980s (Figure 
7). However, towards the end of the 1980s the rate of increase began to accelerate. Since then it has 
been relatively high, with the exception of a few individual years in the mid-1990s. 
The fact that growth in the number of hours worked at the end of the 1990s began to take off was 
mainly due to the rapid expansion in the private, and to some extent also the public, services sector. I 
mentioned earlier the discussions of the significance of the "new economy" for productivity increases 
during the 1990s and as I said productivity growth fell heavily at the beginning of the new millennium. 
The  same  applies  to  the  number  of  hours  worked.  This  raises  the  question,  similar  to  the  case  of 
productivity development, of whether the calculated trend growth in the diagram overestimates the real 
long-term trend increase.  To shed further light upon this  we  need to go through the causes for the 
development in the number of hours worked in recent years. 
The number of hours worked in the economy is determined partly by the number of persons working 
and partly by average  working hours, i.e. how many  hours each person  works. One factor that has 
clearly pulled down the average working hours in recent years is the rise in sick leave. It is uncertain to 
what  extent  this  is  an  effect  of  a  transitory  nature.  Various  studies  have  shown  that  the  amount  of 
short-term sick leave taken tends to increase when the situation on the labour market improves and 
unemployment declines. If sick leave is divided up according to length, it can be seen that the long-
term sick leave has increased most over the past  years. To the extent that this development is the 
result of incentive effects, the increase may be of a more structural nature, which means sick leave will 
not automatically decline when the economic situation deteriorates. In the general debate it has been 
implied that changes in various institutional factors accounted for this interpretation, e.g. that the rules 
for qualification for early retirement pension had become tighter and the remuneration level in sickness 
benefit had been raised. Another important factor here could be that the percentage of older people on 
the labour market has increased somewhat recently. 
Is an increase in sick leave the only explanation for the decline in average working hours? No, it is not. 
And  we  can  see  this  clearly  when  we  study  developments  adjusted  for  absence  due  to  sickness 
(Figure 8). Here we can see that the average working hours have shown a declining tendency even 
when adjusted for people who have not worked due to illness. Compared with the period 1994-1995, 
average  working  hours  have  declined  by  around  3  percentage  points  and  the  negative  tendency  is 
particularly strong after 1999. Moreover, the other curve in my diagram - for the number of employed - 
shows that the growth in working hours last year was curbed by a lower increase in employment. This 
was  in  turn  a  result  of  the  economic  slowdown  no  longer  affecting  just  manufacturing,  but  also  the 
services sector. 
The decline in working hours appears to depend on three main factors, apart from increased absence 
due to illness. The first factor is an increase in other types of absence than illness, e.g. holidays or 
looking after sick children. The second is a decline in the amount of overtime worked and a reduction 
in the working hours agreed between employers and employees. The third factor is a shift where more 
people choose to move over from full-time to part-time work. The relative significance of structural and 
economic factors in this context is again difficult to assess. There are many indications that variations 
in overtime are particularly affected by economic activity. Although it is more difficult to determine how 
this relates to the other factors. The assessment made by the Riksbank so far is that average working 
hours will show a tentative rise when economic activity improves. 
To summarise, there is reason for considerable concern regarding the future labour supply. If there is 
reason  to  be  slightly  more  optimistic  over  productivity  growth,  the  opposite  applies  to  the  labour 
supply.  A  number  of  factors,  such  as  demographic  developments,  absence  due  to  illness  and  the 
proposal for shorter working hours all indicate a decline in the labour supply over the coming decade, 
unless there is a change in policy.

 BIS Review 16/2003
 Future potential growth 
What does all this mean for the assessment of the economy's potential growth capacity right now and 
in the coming years? 
If  we  uncritically  assume  the  simple  model  I  outlined  earlier,  we  could  calculate  an  estimate  of 
potential growth by simply adding together the trend values I showed in the diagram on productivity 
growth and the number of hours worked. I have done this in my next diagram (Figure 9). Measured in 
this  way,  potential  growth  was  just  over  1.5  per  cent  up  to  around  1992.  Since  then  it  has  risen 
gradually to approximately 3 per cent in 2001. However, my discussion of the causes of the decline in 
actual  growth  in  recent  years  showed  that  there  are  good  reasons  to  believe  that  3  per  cent  is  an 
overestimate of the growth potential in the Swedish economy today. One way of subduing the effect 
on the trend of variations in individual years is to estimate the trend as a mean value of the period's 
actual growth. This procedure gives a trend growth of 2 per cent, which I have also indicated in the 
diagram.  If  one  believes  that  the  truth  lies  somewhere  midway  between  the  growth  rates  we  had 
before and after the changeover in our economic policy, one can instead calculate the mean value of 
the mean values during the periods 1980-1992 and 1993 onwards. The result is then 2.2 per cent. 
No  procedure  is  perfect,  of  course.  As  I  mentioned  initially,  the  estimate  results  vary  significantly 
depending on which method is applied and this is one of the reasons why the Riksbank has chosen 
not to specify an exact figure for potential growth. We have instead chosen to work with an interval of 
2 to 2.5 per cent, which has emerged gradually as we have endeavoured to refine our analyses and 
improve  our  knowledge.  The  interval  indicates  that  we  have  been  influenced  by  the  strong  growth 
figures during the latter part of the 1990s, but that we have been cautious in stipulating to any great 
degree our assessments of some form of "new economy". 
A further reason for not specifying potential growth in more detail than this is that new information is 
received continuously and this affects our assessment. As I mentioned earlier, the National Accounts 
have recently been revised and the new results indicate a strong growth in both GDP and productivity 
in Sweden during the period 1993-2002. Such revisions show that there is considerable uncertainty in 
the statistics and that it is important not to overreact to the most recent figures. 
When  we  make  assessments  of  inflation  in  connection  with  monetary  policy  decisions  we  normally 
look two years ahead. In this context we also calculate potential growth with the aid of more detailed 
data.  This  includes  labour  market  data,  for  instance,  to  assess  labour  force  developments  with 
reference to developments in the working population, people in regular education and labour market 
policy training and the number of people on sick leave or early retirement pensions. 
A digression on demography 
Allow me, before I finish, to comment further on demographic developments. One factor that we, like 
many  other  countries,  will  need  to  grapple  is  the  adverse  demographic  development  that  will  take 
place in few years' time. This will entail the percentage of elderly people in the population increasing 
significantly and resulting in a considerable reduction in labour force participation. Large demands will 
be made on public finances and the labour supply and growth trends will be subdued. 
My last slide shows the growth in actual hours worked during the period 1981-2001, together with a 
calculation for growth during the period 2002-2050 (Figure 10). The calculated growth in working hours 
is  based  on  Statistics  Sweden's  forecast  of  the  Swedish  population  up  to  2050  and  fixes  other 
determining  parameters  at  the  2002  level.  The  average  increase  in  working  hours  amounted  to 
approximately  0.4  per  cent  during  the  period  1981-2001.  The  calculated  series'  average  increase 
2002-2050 stops at a modest 0.01 per cent; in practice almost no increase at all.  
Conclusion 
I shall conclude with a summary. A high long-term growth rate is one of the most important objectives 
of  economic  policy.  It  becomes  easier  to  achieve  almost  all  other  political  objectives  if  economic 
growth is good. There is greater scope for private consumption and wage formation is made easier. It 
becomes easier to finance public sector services such as health and welfare. Higher growth also gives 
greater scope in other political areas, such as environmental policy.  
In  addition,  the  potential,  long-term  growth  rate  is  a  variable  of  essential  significance  for  monetary 
policy. The Riksbank cannot itself influence the development of the economy's long-term growth rate; 
BIS Review 16/2003

 this is governed by other factors, primarily by how much we work and how efficient the economy is. 
But the potential growth rate to a great degree sets the framework for monetary policy. Simplified, one 
can say that our task is to keep actual production as close to potential production as possible. Then 
inflation will also come close to the target level. Following on from this, the higher the potential growth 
rate, the faster the Swedish GDP can grow without putting the inflation target at risk. 
A  natural  starting  point  for  calculating  potential  growth  in  the  economy  is  the  growth  trend  for 
productivity and the labour supply.  Productivity  growth has shown tendencies towards improvement 
during  the  1990s.  It  is  probable  that  factors  such  as  the  new  low-inflation  rate  regime  and  greater 
openness with stiffer competition have played an important role in this development. However, it is far 
from certain that the high rates of increase at the end of the 1990s will continue. They mirrored both a 
rapid growth in the private sector relative to the public sector and a strong growth in the IT/telecom 
sector. Nevertheless, it is probable that the long-term increase in productivity is higher now than it was 
during the 1970s and 1980s.  
The number of hours worked has also developed relatively favourably since the mid-1990s. However, 
this  development  has  largely  depended  on  demand,  influenced  by  the  fact  that  there  were 
considerable unutilised resources in the economy after the crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. With 
regard  to  the  labour  supply,  there  is  less  reason  for  optimism,  partly  because  the  demographic 
situation will be adverse in a few years' time, with more departures from the labour force relative to 
entries.  Nor  are  there  clear  signs  that  economic  policy  has  been  organised  to  contributed  to  an 
increase in the labour supply in future. The incentives to work have rather been reduced in the social 
insurance system in recent years. There are also discussions now of reducing working hours. 
The Riksbank has earlier spoken of a potential growth rate in the economy in the interval of 2-2.5 per 
cent. We have not considered it possible to be more precise than this. Of course, we are constantly 
examining our view in the light of new data and analyses. When we look ahead two years, there is no 
reason to change this view now; it is important that no one misunderstands me here. But if the current 
trends for the labour supply persist, it is likely that we will have to assume in the longer term a potential 
growth rate closer to 2 per cent than 2.5 per cent.   
Thank you!
