Svante Öberg: The Riksbank and the Swedish economy  
Speech by Mr Svante Öberg, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at a meeting of SIMRA, the 
Swedish Society of Business Analysts, Stockholm, 5 October 2006. 
 I would first like to thank you for the invitation to this lunch meeting. Today I intend to speak about 
monetary policy and wage formation. This is a very topical subject, particularly given that most of the 
collective wage agreements in the labour market are due to be renegotiated next year and that wage 
formation has such significance for developments in inflation and the stability of the Swedish economy. 
Wage formation has functioned much better over the past 10-15 years than it did during the 1970s and 
1980s and it is essential that this good development can continue.  
I will divide my speech into five parts: First a section on how monetary policy is conducted, followed by 
a section containing a long-term perspective on economic developments, and then a section on how 
wage  formation  has  changed,  a  section  on  the  conditions  for  wage  bargaining  and  finally  I  will 
conclude with a summary. Allow me to begin by describing how we work at the Riksbank. 
How monetary policy is conducted 
In  Sweden  we  now  conduct  monetary  and  exchange  rate  policy  based  on  inflation  targeting  and  a 
floating exchange rate. This is different from the decades up to autumn 1992 when we had a fixed 
exchange rate as target. The way we at the Riksbank conduct our monetary policy is described in the 
brochure “Monetary policy in Sweden”, which was published in May this year and is available on our 
website. I shall here reproduce the main features of the brochure and provide some comments of my 
own. 
The target for monetary policy is to maintain a low and stable level of inflation. The assignment we 
have been given by Parliament is to “maintain price stability”. The Riksbank has specified an inflation 
target  whereby  the  annual  change  in  the  consumer  price  index  (CPI)  is  to  be  2  per  cent  with  a 
tolerance interval of plus/minus 1 percentage point.  
The  target  for  monetary  policy  is  thus  formulated  in  terms  of  CPI.  However,  when  we  analyse  the 
development  of  inflation,  we  look  at  several  different  measures.  Underlying  inflation  measured  as 
UND1X is one such measure. This excludes household mortgage interest expenditure and the direct 
effects of taxes and subsidies. The former is particularly important, as an increase in the policy rate 
pushes up the CPI. It then looks as though inflation increases when we raise the policy rate, despite 
the  fact  that  this  measure  will  in  the  long-term  dampen  inflation.  There  is  no  such  problem  with 
UND1X.  However,  we  also  look  at  other  measures.  For  the  purpose  of  more  clearly  explaining  the 
analysis, it may sometimes be necessary to disregard energy prices, or to divide inflation up into price 
developments on imported and domestically-produced goods.  
The effect of monetary policy on inflation has a considerable time lag. It is therefore necessary for us 
at the Riksbank to make forecasts of economic developments. Previously, we made these forecasts 
on the assumption that the policy rate would remain constant during the forecast period. The simple 
policy rule was then described as being that if inflation was forecast as being lower than the target of 2 
per  cent,  the  policy  rate  would  normally  be  cut.  We  now  make  forecasts  based  on  the  policy  rate 
developing in accordance with market expectations. If the forecast shows that inflation will be lower 
than  2  per  cent,  this  does  not  necessarily  mean  we  must  cut  the  policy  rate,  but  that  we  should 
perhaps raise it at a slightly slower pace than the market is expecting. 
However, forecasts are uncertain, and become increasingly uncertain the longer the forecast horizon 
extends. I have spent a lot of time working on forecasts in my career and I perhaps therefore tend to 
emphasise the uncertainty of forecasts more than many others. In recent years the strong productivity 
growth  and  low  import  prices,  both  surprising  outcomes,  have  contributed  to  inflation  being  below 
target. We analyse economic developments in a broad perspective and try to identify the factors that 
could lead to a higher or lower inflation rate than implied in the forecast. This “risk outlook” also affects 
the monetary policy stance. 
We thus have one objective for our monetary policy: CPI should increase by 2 per cent a year in the 
long term. However, we are not “inflation nutters”. We do not concentrate on inflation to the exclusion

of all else; we also give consideration to real economic and financial developments. We conduct what 
is known as flexible inflation targeting. It is made fairly clear in the preparatory works to the Sveriges 
Riksbank  Act  that  the  idea  is  that  we  shall  also  give  consideration  to  developments  in  the  real 
economy as long as the inflation target is not threatened. 
in 
the  1980s.  After 
this  was  not  successful 
A long-term perspective 
I will now move on to talk about the development of the Swedish economy in a long-term perspective. 
Let me begin by observing that I personally consider monetary policy to have been very successful 
since the crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. There is a substantial difference between the economic 
developments  over  the  past  14  years  and  during  the  decades  prior  to  this  period.  Sweden  had  an 
inflation rate much higher than that in Germany every year of the 1980s (see Figure 1).  
The  1980s  began  with  two  devaluations  of  10  per  cent  and  16  per  cent.  For  a  devaluation  to  be 
successful,  inflation  must  be  kept  down  afterwards  so  the  country  does  not  lose  competitiveness 
again.  However, 
the  devaluations,  Sweden’s 
competitiveness declined by around 30 per cent up to the crisis breaking out in 1992 (see Figure 2). 
The 1990s also began with a depreciation of the Swedish krona amounting to 20-25 per cent when we 
abandoned  the  krona  peg  to  the  European  ecu  in  autumn  1992.  Unlike  the  1980s,  inflation  was 
afterwards  pressed  down  to  the  same  level  as  Germany  (see  Figure  1).  We  have  even  continued 
strengthening our competitiveness through strong productivity growth and moderate wage increases 
(see Figure 2).  
Why  did  we  not  succeed  in  bringing  down  inflation  to  the  same  level  as  other  countries  during  the 
1970s  and  1980s?  The  most  important  explanations  are  the  history  of  repeated  devaluations, 
insufficiently  tight  fiscal  and  monetary  policy,  an  overheated  labour  market  and  deregulation  of  the 
credit  market  with  ensuing  credit  expansion.  An  important  difference  compared  with  the  present 
situation with a clear inflation target is that monetary policy under the regime of that time, with a fixed 
exchange rate, could not help subdue the overheating as it was detailed to maintain the fixed krona 
exchange rate. 
During the 1990s, on the other hand, we succeeded in bringing down inflation to the same level as 
other  countries.  However,  this  required  drastic  measures.  The  1990s  began  with  the  most  severe 
crisis in the Swedish economy since the 1930s. Open unemployment rose to a high point of 9 per cent 
in  1993.  This  had  a  dampening  effect on  prices  and  wages.  In  addition,  fiscal  policy  and  monetary 
policy  were  very  tight.  The  budget  consolidation  in  the  mid-1990s  was  very  extensive  and  interest 
rates  were  kept  at  a  very  high  level  during  a  transition  period.  Moreover,  the  conditions  for  the 
Riksbank to take action were improved as the bank was gradually given increased independence and 
in 1999 was given a statutory objective of safeguarding price stability. 
Developments  since  the  crisis  have  been  good  on  the  whole,  even  regarding  other  aspects  than 
inflation and competitiveness: 
• 
Growth has been high. On average, GDP has increased by 2.9 per cent a year during 1994-
2005 as compared with 1.8 per cent a year during 1970-1993 (see Figure 3). 
Employment has increased and unemployment has declined, although not as much as might 
be desired (see Figure 4). However, the Riksbank’s assessment in the most recent Inflation 
Report  was  that  the  labour  market  situation  would  continue  to  improve  over  the  coming 
years. 
Public finances have improved to an extent where they now show stable surpluses of around 
2 per cent of GDP (see Figure 5). 
The current account balance has improved and now shows very large surpluses (see Figure 
5). Exports as a percentage of GDP have increased from 27 per cent in 1992 to 49 per cent 
in 2005. 
   Wage formation has improved 
At  the  end  of  the  1980s  it  had  become  increasingly  evident  that  Swedish  wage  formation  did  not 
function in a manner compatible with economic balance. It was common that central wage agreements 
2 
 BIS Review 93/2006
signed  in  the  1980s  contained  price  development  guarantees,  wage  development  guarantees, 
earnings development guarantees, control stations, etc., which led to prices and wages chasing one 
another  in  an  upwards  spiral.  The  work  on  changing  wage  formation  can  be  divided  into  three 
important steps. 
The first step entailed the Government appointing the Rehnberg Commission in March 1990. On the 
basis of the Commission’s proposals, stabilisation agreements were signed covering the greater part 
of the labour market, which meant that the rate of wage increase fell from around 10 per cent in 1990 
to 3-4 per cent in 1992-1993. The fact that a lower rate of wage increase was not yet fully established 
in the mid-1990s is, however, shown by the fact that wage increases rose again to around 6 per cent 
in 1996, after the 1995 wage bargaining rounds.  
The  second  step  entailed  the  social  partners  in  the  industrial  sector  signing  a  new  cooperation 
agreement  in  March  1997,  known  as  the  Industrial  Agreement,  whereby  the  parties  took  joint 
responsibility  for  wage  formation  in  their  part  of  the  labour  market  and  had  agreed  on  a  regulatory 
framework for negotiating wage agreements. The agreement was followed by similar, but not as far-
reaching, agreements in other sectors. 
The  third  step  meant  that  the  new  National  Mediation  Office  began  its  operations  in  2000.  This 
established a third, independent party in the labour market, which could actively promote an efficiently-
functioning wage formation process. The National Mediation Office also received increased powers of 
authority to take action in connection with wage bargaining rounds. The National Institute of Economic 
Research  was  given  the  task  of  annually  producing  reports  on  the  economic  conditions  for  wage 
formation. 
The results of these changes are clear and positive. Since the crisis at the beginning of the 1990s, 
wage formation has functioned much better than before. The agreements no longer contain flexibility 
clauses and wage drift is much more limited. The number of labour market conflicts has been lower 
than before. Real wage increases, which reflect what we can buy for our wages, have been better than 
before, while the nominal increases have been markedly lower than before (see Figure 6). 
The  social  partners  have  contributed  in  a  constructive  manner  to  this  positive  development.  The 
positive institutional changes in several areas – e.g. new regulations for fiscal policy, monetary policy 
and wage formation - are strongly contributing factors to the favourable developments since the crisis 
in the early 1990s. 
Conditions for wage bargaining rounds 
The  inflation  process  has  changed  in  nature  in  recent  years,  not  only  in  Sweden  but  also  in  many 
other  countries.  As  the  inflation-targeting  policy  has  gained  credibility,  inflation  is  increasingly 
determined  by  inflation  expectations.  Inflation  has  become  lower  and  also  appears  to  be  less 
dependent  on  variations  in  capacity  utilisation  (the  short-term  Phillips  curve  has  shifted  downwards 
and become flatter). Capacity utilisation mainly affects inflation through wage formation. 
However,  wage  costs  still  play  an  important  role  in  the  inflation  process.  For  example,  the 
unexpectedly strong productivity growth, combined with moderate wage increases, has contributed to 
inflation being below target in recent years. Wage formation will remain a focal point in the monetary 
policy analyses, particularly next year when the majority of the collective wage agreements are due to 
be renegotiated. 
The level of capacity utilisation and the impact it has on wage formation are also important and topical 
issues.  The  OECD  calculates  what  is  known  as  the  GDP  gap.  Their  interpretation  is  that  capacity 
utilisation in the Swedish economy is already higher this year than is compatible with a low and stable 
inflation rate. However, calculating the GDP gap and similar measures is a very uncertain process. 
Nor are the measures stable; they change over time. 
The National Institute of Economic Research (NIER) calculates the labour market gap and equilibrium 
unemployment. The calculation in the most recent wage formation report shows the labour market gap 
as  being  close  to  zero  in  2007  and  then  becoming  slightly  positive  in  2008  and  2009.  Equilibrium 
unemployment is calculated at 4.5 per cent; it is predicted that this level will be reached next year and 
that open unemployment will thereafter be slightly below equilibrium level. However, according to the 
NIER,  the  social  partners  have  the  possibility  in  the  central  wage  negotiations  next  year  to  choose 
different alternative actions that could either reduce or increase equilibrium unemployment.

Capacity utilisation can also be followed more directly in the NIER’s business tendency surveys and 
through analyses of labour supply. The business tendency surveys indicate that capacity utilisation is 
not  yet  so  high  seen  over  the  economy  as  a  whole.  However,  it  has  risen  to  high  levels  in  the 
construction sector and in certain services sectors. Analyses of the labour supply also indicate that 
there are substantial labour reserves. Open unemployment is still relatively high. In addition, there will 
be many latent job-seekers, including full-time students looking for work, and an increasing number of 
people will continue to work after they reach the age of retirement. Labour force immigration will also 
increase. 
To summarise, I can see that the economic conditions for next year’s wage bargaining rounds look 
good. Growth is high and employment is rising, but the economic upturn is, in my view, not so strong 
as  to  prevent  capacity  utilisation  remaining  at  a  relatively  normal  level  next  year.  Profits  in  the 
business sector are good, but not as exaggerated as in the mid-1990s when we last faced problems 
with  overly  high  nominal  wages.  Inflation  is  moderate  and  the  conditions  for  attaining  the  inflation 
target over the coming years are good, on condition that the Riksbank gradually increases the repo 
rate. This was also the message in our most recently-published Inflation Report.  
Conclusion 
Let me conclude with a summary of what I have said so far. The experiences of the 1970s and 1980s 
were very negative. Repeated crises and poor support from inflation expectations did not give good 
results in terms of production growth and real wages. The experiences of the past 10-15 years have 
been good, however. Fiscal and monetary policy have laid the foundations for better economic growth 
and  wage  formation  has  improved.  The  social  partners  have  actively  contributed  to  this  good 
development. The results are positive. Growth has been high and real wages have risen, despite the 
moderate increases in nominal wages. 
It is of course extremely important that this positive development can continue over the coming years. 
The  economic  conditions  for  next  year’s  wage  bargaining  rounds  are  good  and  there  thus  is  every 
reason to believe that wage formation will continue to function well. However, we will of course closely 
follow developments. 
The contribution that the Riksbank can make is to conduct a monetary policy aimed at ensuring that 
inflation and inflation expectations develop in accordance with our target. This in turn means that the 
social partners can continue to sign agreements based on the assumption that the inflation target will 
be  met  a  couple  of  years  ahead.  Judging  from  the  surveys  we  make  of  inflation  expectations, 
monetary  policy  in  this  respect  has  a  very  high  level  of  credibility.  It  is  the  task  of  myself  and  my 
colleagues on the Executive Board to ensure that this remains the case.
