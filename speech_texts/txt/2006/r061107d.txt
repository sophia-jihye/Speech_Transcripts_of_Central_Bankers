Lars Nyberg: The Riksbank and the property market  
Speech by Mr Lars Nyberg, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at a lunch meeting, arranged 
by Connect Skåne, Kristianstad, 6 November 2006. 
 To begin with, I should like to thank you for the invitation to come here to Kristianstad to speak about 
developments in the property market. This is a subject that certainly engages people, not merely us 
economists but also people who are not usually interested in economics or what the Riksbank does. 
The main interest is probably due to a house purchase being the largest individual investment most of 
us make in our lives. 
The Riksbank’s interest in the property market is based on the two tasks we have been set by the 
Riksdag (the Swedish parliament). One is to ensure that inflation remains at two per cent a year, with 
a tolerated deviation interval of plus/minus one percentage point. The other task is to "promote a safe 
and  efficient  payment  system”,  as  it  says  in  the  text  of  the  law.  We  wish  to  avoid  the  type  of 
catastrophe Sweden experienced during the bank crisis at the beginning of the 1990s and we usually 
call this safeguarding financial stability. As I shall discuss a little later, developments in the property 
market  can  be  significant  for  both  these  tasks  and  this  is  the  reason  for  our  interest.  I  will  start  by 
discussing issues of financial stability, but at the end I will also talk about questions concerning the 
inflation target. 
The  property  market  consists  of  two  markets;  a  market  for  commercial  property  and  a  market  for 
houses and tenant-owned apartments. I intend to begin by discussing the commercial property market. 
Commercial property 
The commercial property market has in important link to financial stability. The reason for this is that 
property companies are the largest individual borrowers from the banks, which in turn play a central 
role in the financial system. Approximately 20 per cent of the four major banks’ lending to the Swedish 
non-bank  public  is  to  property  management  companies.  If  property  management  companies 
experience payment problems, this could have serious effects on the banking system in the form of 
loan  losses,  like  those we  experienced  at  the  beginning of  the  1990s (Figure  1).  Experiences  have 
shown that financial crises often stem from property companies with substantial loans and a stock of 
commercial property. The high exposure and the fact that property is often used as collateral for loans 
justify regular analyses of the property sector by the Riksbank. These analyses focus on the markets 
for commercial property in Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö, as office premises in these metropolitan 
areas are predominant in the Swedish property companies’ property stocks. 
In  recent  years,  turnover  of  properties  has  risen  significantly.  The  buyers  are  not  solely  Swedish 
investors; foreign investors have also showed considerable interest over the past few years. During 
the  first  half  of  2006,  foreign  investors  accounted  for  more  than  40  per  cent  of  the  investment  in 
commercial property. From a stability perspective, there are both advantages and disadvantages to 
foreign investors being active in the Swedish property market. The advantages include the fact that a 
larger number of investors means that the risks are spread better and the property market becomes 
more liquid. However, one disadvantage with foreign ownership is that the contagion risk from other 
countries to the Swedish property market increases. For instance, an international investor may sell 
Swedish property to cover losses made in another part of the world. In this way, commercial property 
prices in Sweden may change without any actual change in the domestic economy. 
Prices for office premises have risen in all of the metropolitan regions since 2005 (Figure 2). However, 
cyclically-related factors such as rents and vacancy ratios have not altered to a corresponding degree. 
Ever since the property crisis at the beginning of the 1990s, prices and rents have almost gone hand 
in  hand,  but  this  trend  now  appears  to  have  been  broken.  Real  prices  increased  during  the  third 
quarter by 36 per cent on an annual rate in Stockholm, 32 per cent in Göteborg and 11 per cent in 
Malmö. During the same period, rents rose by between 1 and 1.5 per cent in these three cities and the 
vacancy ratio remained in principle unchanged. 
Prices thus do not appear to have been driven by fundamental factors such as rents and vacancies, 
but instead by investors lowering their rate of return requirement. The size of this requirement depends

partly on long-term interest rates, but also on how much risk investors are willing to take, what risk 
premium they require. As long-term interest rates have not fallen - they have more probably risen - 
during the period, this indicates that falling risk premiums have pushed up prices. While this in itself is 
no great surprise – risk premiums on all kinds of high risk assets around the world have fallen in recent 
years, and it would have been surprising if Swedish commercial property had been an exception from 
this trend – there is reason to question whether the current low risk premiums are reasonable. If they 
were to be adjusted upwards to the earlier more normal levels, this would create downward pressure 
on  commercial  property  prices.  The  Riksbank  thus  has  reason  to  continue  closely  following 
developments in this field. 
Nevertheless, earnings and payment capacity in the property sector are good. Unlike the early 1990s, 
the property companies have on the whole sufficient capital to be able to manage a reasonable fall in 
property prices. My assessment is therefore that the commercial property sector does not constitute a 
threat to the stability of the financial system at present. 
The housing market 
Let  me  now  move  on  to  the  housing  market.  Approximately  40  per  cent  of  the  credit  institutions’ 
lending to the Swedish non-bank public consists of loans to Swedish households with their housing as 
collateral.  If  the  household  should  for  some  reason  experience  difficulty  in  meeting  interest  and 
mortgage  payments,  this  would  affect  the  banks’  capacity  to  play  their  central  role  in  the  financial 
system. However, we believe that the probability of such a scenario is thankfully slight. I will return to 
this in a moment. 
The  rise  in  house  prices  over  the  past  ten  years  has  been  spectacular,  seen  from  a  historical 
perspective. Since  1996 house  prices have  increased  by  around  130  per cent  (Figure  3), while  the 
average price per square metre for a tenant-owned apartment has risen by around 250 per cent1. As 
house  prices  have  soared,  household  indebtedness  has  also  increased  rapidly.  This  is  not  an 
exclusively  Swedish  phenomenon  –  throughout  the  developed  world,  with  a  few  exceptions,  the 
pattern  is  repeated  –  and  compared  with  some  countries  developments  in  Sweden  appear  almost 
modest. One contributory factor to the relatively modest upturn in Sweden is that here we buy houses 
almost  solely  to  live  in.  It  is  relatively  common  in  many  other  countries,  particularly  Anglo-Saxon 
countries, that individuals buy housing to rent out. They buy extra housing in the same way one buys 
equity or other financial assets in the hope that they will increase in value. However, this of course 
increases the risk of prices falling, as it is easier to sell a house one rents out than one where one 
lives. 
Why has housing become so expensive? 
In  connection  with  discussions  of  the  housing  market  there  are  often  claims  that  the  market  is 
overvalued in the sense that the prices can no longer be rationally explained. I believe that the house 
prices and household indebtedness can be largely explained by four underlying causes: low interest 
rates,  increases  in  households’  incomes,  a  limited  supply  of  housing  and  structural  changes  in  the 
mortgage market.2  
One important explanation for the low interest rates is that Sweden has moved from being a country 
with  a  high  and  volatile  inflation  rate  to  a  country  with  low  and  stable  inflation.  Real  interest  rates 
(interest rates adjusted for inflation) have fallen, which has made it cheaper to borrow to buy housing. 
In addition, in an economy with high nominal interest rates, the payment burden for a loan is to a high 
degree concentrated on the first year. If, for instance, a household borrows an amount corresponding 
to  5  years’  incomes  when  the  nominal  interest  rate  is  20  per  cent,  the  household  will  put  its  entire 
annual income in interest expenditure during the first year, which is a burden no household can bear. 
After that it does not matter if inflation is high and in the long term undermines the value of the loan, as 
the household will face payment problems the very first year. This distortion of the payment burden 
                                                      
1   The reason I am using 1996 as a starting point is that it is only from this year that price data is available for tenant-owned 
apartments. Price statistics for tenant-owned apartment are based on data from www.maklarstatistik.se. House prices are 
measured using Statistics Sweden's property price index for permanent houses.

towards the period directly after the loan has been taken thus acts as a liquidity restriction. Now that 
nominal  interest  rates  have  become  much  lower,  the  payment  burden  has  become  more  evenly 
distributed  over  time,  which  means  that  this  liquidity  restriction  is  not  as  strictly  binding  and  it  is 
therefore  possible  for  households  to  take  out  larger  loans  that  can  be  used  to  finance  housing 
purchases. This in turn pushes up prices. 
Another reason why house prices have risen is the good development in the Swedish real economy 
since  the  crisis  at  the  beginning  of  the  1990s.  Despite  the  fact  that  unemployment  has  become 
entrenched  at  a  high  level  by  Swedish  standards,  households’  disposable  incomes  have  increased 
significantly. This has of course increased households’ payment ability and the demand for housing. 
A third reason is the limited construction of new housing. This in turn is partly an after-effect of the 
bank and property crises, but is primarily linked to the changeover in housing policy during the 1990s. 
Until that time, residential construction had been heavily subsidised, mainly via interest subsidy. The 
interest subsidy meant that the central government guaranteed a low interest rate. During the 1980s, 
inflation was high, which meant that it was not only cheap to borrow, the loan in principle paid itself off. 
If the capital investment appraisal were to prove wrong, the local authorities often supplied generous 
guarantees. The risk entailed in a housing investment was therefore in practice moved from those who 
built  the  housing  to  the  taxpayers3.  In  connection  with  the  crisis  at  the  beginning  of  the  1990s  the 
interest  subsidies  were  reduced  and  the  public  sector  ceased  providing  guarantees  for  housing 
investment. This meant that it was no longer so attractive to build housing (Figure 4). Construction has 
picked up again since 2000, as house prices have risen. However, the response of new construction 
to price increases has nevertheless been surprisingly slow. One reason for this is that it may only be 
profitable to build in metropolitan regions and there may be a shortage of space for new building here4 
Moreover, it is not unlikely that rent regulations have reduced interest in building new rental properties, 
which  has  channelled  the  household  sector’s  willingness  to  pay  for  housing  towards  houses  and 
tenant-owned apartments. 
We thus have a situation where households have had a good increase in income, combined with the 
fact that it has been inexpensive to borrow, while there has been only a small supply. Although the 
housing  market  may  have  its  peculiarities,  it  essentially  functions  like  any  other  market  –  a  high 
demand and small supply mean high prices. 
The mortgage market 
The  significant  changes  in  the  mortgage  market  have  also  contributed  to  house  prices  rising  so 
sharply. These changes are based in the credit deregulation that took place during the second half of 
the 1980s, but it is not until the last few years that they have really made an impact. The crisis at the 
beginning  of  the  1990s  delayed  developments  here,  too.  One  important  change  in  the  mortgage 
market is that competition has stiffened and that the mortgage institutions’ margins have been pressed 
down, which has cut mortgage interest rates more than the general fall in interest rates. Moreover, the 
mortgage institutions have become more flexible with regard to the degree of borrowing and now offer 
a broader spectrum of products. 
One  change  that  I  feel  deserves  a  little  extra  attention  is  the  fact  that  mortgage  institutions  have 
become less strict in their amortisation requirements. One might wonder why the amortisation periods 
have increased as much as they have and why fewer households are choosing to amortise. For new 
house  owners  with  relatively  ordinary  incomes,  it  may  seem  meaningless  to  amortise  SEK  1,000  a 
month on a loan of, for instance, SEK 1.5 million. Of course it can be a good idea to pay off some of 
one’s mortgage, as it makes the household balance sheet less sensitive to changes in house prices, 
but  there  is  no  intrinsic  value  in  a  household  with  a  mortgage  amortising  its  loan  at  all  costs. 
Amortisation is a form of saving and having amortised a whole loan, without having saved in any other 
form, means that one has invested the whole of one’s savings in one’s housing.

Research at Uppsala University, it was only marginally profitable to build new housing in Kristianstad in 2005.

The most important thing, however, is that a household has some form of saving that can be used to 
meet  unforeseen  negative  income  shocks,  renovation  requirements,  or  even  to  make  a  pension  go 
further. Regarded as a whole, there is no risk that the Swedish household sector is saving too little – 
household  saving  as  a  percentage  of  disposable  incomes  now  amounts  to  around  8  per  cent. 
However, it is unclear which households account for the high level of saving. There is a risk that young 
households now making their debut in the housing market have lost touch with history and become 
used  to  annual  percentage  increases  in  house  prices  of  around  ten  per  cent  or  more.  Naturally, 
households  cannot  base  their  private  financial  calculations  on  property  prices  continuing  to  rise 
sharply. A person who bought their housing 10 years ago has probably made a good deal, but seen in 
the longer term, housing has not been a spectacular form of investment. 
Another  change  in  the  mortgage  market  that  might  have  consequences  for  the  real  economy  in 
particular, is that an increasing percentage of lending to households is at a variable interest rate. This, 
combined with the high indebtedness, has meant that changes in general interest rates have had a 
greater impact on households’ private finances. Households’ increased appetite for variable loans has 
so  far  coincided  with  low  interest  rates,  which  has  meant  that  many  households  have  seen  their 
interest costs fall. If interest rates rise, these costs will increase just as quickly, and households with 
very substantial loans and a large share of these at a variable interest rate, will face significant cost 
increases 
Given that house prices have risen so rapidly in recent years, it is natural to wonder how long this 
development can continue. In recent months there have been indications that the housing market may 
be entering a calmer phase. The rate of increase in both household borrowing and house prices is 
lower now than it was last spring5, while forward-looking indicators such as SEB’s housing indicator 
and SBAB’s estate agents survey point towards lower rates of increase in the future. However, the 
statistical base is still fairly uncertain and it is too early to talk of a break in trend. Our experiences and 
international  experiences  show  that  it  is  difficult,  if  not  very  difficult,  to  make  accurate  forecasts  of 
housing prices. However, it is clear that the current development, with increases of a good 10 per cent 
a year, cannot be regarded as sustainable in the long term. On the other hand, I do not believe that a 
fall in house prices on a broader scale is a particularly likely scenario, although this could happen here 
and  there  in  certain  regions.  The  most  probable  scenario  is  that  house  prices  will  continue  to  rise, 
albeit at a slower rate than they have done in recent years. 
Are there any risks with this development? 
As household debts have increased, the question has been raised as to whether the household sector 
is borrowing too heavily and what the effects would be on the banks’ loan losses if the macro economy 
were to develop unfavourably. Given that the Swedish household sector’s total debts currently amount 
to  almost  140  per  cent  of  disposable  incomes,  which  is  a  few  percentage  points  higher  than 
immediately  prior  to  the  bank  crisis,  this  is  a  reasonable  question  (Figure  5).  The  Riksbank  has 
collected  data  on  thousands  of  individual  households’  finances  from  Statistics  Sweden  for  several 
years  now.  These  statistics  show  that  the  households  with  the  largest  debts  also  have  the  highest 
incomes and the largest wealth. We have also examined what would happen to households’ ability to 
pay  if  unemployment  or  interest  rates  were  to  rise.  The  overall  assessment  is  that  households  at 
present cannot cause loan losses to such an extent that the stability of the banking system would be 
threatened. However, even if the household sector’s ability to pay on the whole is good, there is of 
course a risk that individual households will borrow too much and may experience payment problems. 
With regard  to  financial  stability,  I  see no serious risks  in  the  growing  household  indebtedness and 
rising property prices. Are there any risks with regard to the inflation target? This question is slightly 
more  difficult  to  answer. How  developments  in  the asset  markets,  such  as  the  housing  market,  will 
affect monetary policy for a central bank with an inflation target is a subject debated all over the world 
by academics and economic decision-makers. 
The  problem  can  be  formulated  roughly  as  follows:  The  increases  we  have  seen  in  household 
indebtedness  are  not  sustainable  in  the  long  term;  household  debts  cannot  grow  twice  as  fast  as 
incomes  over  long  periods  of  time.  A  downward  adjustment  must  therefore  be  made  to  the  rate  of 
                                                      
5   Measured  as  an  annual  percentage  change  in  the  monthly  purchase  price  coefficient  in  Statistics  Sweden’s  figures  for 
house prices.

increase  in  household  indebtedness,  compared  with  the  present  rate.  It  is  not  clear  how  this 
adjustment will occur. Normally this happens at a gradual rate as an increasing number of households 
realise that they have borrowed as much as their finances can tolerate. However, the adjustment can 
also  occur  more  suddenly,  and  the  higher  the  debt  ratio  becomes  and  the  more  property  prices 
increase, the greater is the probability that the adjustment will not be orderly. What we remember from 
the beginning of the 1990s is that this type of development can have very marked effects on the real 
economy. As I see it, it is quite natural that we at the Riksbank should take into account the risk of this 
kind  of  setback  further  ahead.  To  some  extent  one  might  say  that  we  have  contributed  to  this 
development through a successful inflation-targeting policy and low interest rates. 
What  a  central  bank  can  do  to  manage  this  kind  of  risk  is  to  constantly  remind  everyone  of  the 
existence of the risks, through speeches and documents. We can also bring forward changes in the 
policy  rate  that  are  already  motivated  with  regard  to  inflation  targeting  in  our  monetary  policy 
decisions.  We  have  taken  both  measures.  The  hope  is  that  monetary  policy  and  the  Riksbank’s 
arguments may contribute to reducing the risk of an overly rapid and far-reaching build-up of debt, and 
thereby also reduce the risk of a more abrupt adjustment of household indebtedness further ahead. 
It has sometimes been claimed that these considerations have meant that the Riksbank has given less 
priority  to  the  inflation  target  and  begun  to  regard  house  prices  and  household  borrowing  as  target 
variables. This is not the case. The purpose of taking into account household indebtedness and house 
prices is to safeguard the inflation target and a stable development in the real economy, also in the 
longer  term.  These  considerations  could  and  should,  in  my  opinion,  be  accommodated  within  the 
scope of the flexible inflation-targeting policy the Riksbank conducts, like many other central banks. 
The  Riksbank  is  far  from  the  only  central  bank  to  make  this  type  of  consideration.  Household 
indebtedness  and  house  prices  have  increased  at  an  even  faster  rate  in  other  countries,  as  I 
mentioned earlier. 
However, I consider that the question of house prices and household indebtedness has been given 
much  more  attention  in  the  monetary  policy  debate  than  it  actually  deserves,  considering  the 
significance this question has for monetary policy decisions. In the media the interest rate increases 
have  sometimes  been  linked  directly  to  developments  in  the  housing  market.  This  is  an  incorrect 
picture. When we gradually raised the repo rate this year by a total of one and a quarter percentage 
points, it was because our inflation forecasts indicated that inflation would otherwise have been above 
the two per cent target at the end of the forecast period. This in turn was primarily due to economic 
activity  developing  strongly,  both  in  Sweden  and  abroad.  If  the  repo  rate  had  not  been  raised  to 
counteract this development, it would in the long term have affected capacity utilisation in the economy 
and  pushed  up  inflation.  Good  productivity  growth  and  low  imported  inflation  have  meant  that 
inflationary pressures are lower than they usually are in corresponding cyclical phases, which has also 
enabled us to make the increases at a slow rate. 
I am therefore not particularly worried at present that the property market, either the commercial or the 
residential, will cause problems for financial stability. I can recommend to anyone interested in more 
in-depth information that they read the Riksbank’s Financial Stability Report, which will be published at 
the  beginning  of  December.  I  am  not  particularly  worried  that  house  prices  and  household 
indebtedness have increased to such levels that a rebound would cause serious problems to the real 
economy and thereby affect the inflation-targeting policy. However, we are alert, as we do not wish 
this to happen. 
Thank you.
