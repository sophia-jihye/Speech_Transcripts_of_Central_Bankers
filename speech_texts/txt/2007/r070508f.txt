Paul Tucker: A perspective on recent monetary and financial system 
developments 
Speech by Mr Paul Tucker, Executive Director and Member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the 
Bank of England, at Merrill Lynch Conference “A perspective on recent monetary and financial system 
developments”, London, 26 April 2007. 
 Global monetary and financial stability 
The past year or so has been marked by resilience in both the global economy and the international 
financial  system.  World  growth  has  been  robust.  On  average,  headline  inflation  across  the 
industrialised  world  has  remained  contained.  Capital  markets  have,  so  far,  weathered  the  gradual 
withdrawal of monetary accommodation in much of the G7, and also a series of specific disturbances, 
without  destabilising  spillovers.  In  short,  the  world  has  enjoyed  a  further  period  of  monetary  and 
financial stability. Against that background, banks and dealers have posted fairly remarkable profits, 
accumulating  more  capital  resources;  and  the  (risk-unadjusted)  returns  of  the  fund  sector  –  and  so 
probably for most of you here today – have been healthy.  
There are, for sure, wrinkles in this picture, including here in the UK. But overall it is probably not what 
most commentators would have expected given that oil prices have more than doubled over recent 
years. For financial markets, it has surely been important that such a large cost shock has not led to a 
pronounced rise in global inflation, dislodging medium-term inflation expectations, and so prompting 
industrialised country monetary authorities to slam on the brakes. With the build up of household debt 
in many countries, and releveraging of parts of the corporate sector, that would not have been a happy 
prospect.  
That,  taking  the  industrialised  world  as  a  whole,  monetary  credibility  has  been  sustained  without 
aggressive  policy  action  may  owe  something  to  the  reasons  for  the  increases  in  energy  and  other 
commodity  prices  –  namely,  the  rise  of  China,  India  and  other  Asian  economies  which,  as  well  as 
boosting  global  demand,  has  also  been  putting  downward  pressure  on  internationally  traded  goods 
prices. But, as the Bank has argued before, the way these relative price changes play out in terms of 
headline consumer price inflation depends on the overall path of aggregate nominal demand. And that 
in turn owes something to the behaviour of central banks.  
The  textbook  response  to  a  cost  shock  is  supposedly  to  allow  the  price  level  to  rise,  with  the 
associated temporary pick up in inflation being just that – temporary. In the jargon of central banking, 
the  “first  round  effects  should  be  accommodated”  in  order  to  contain  output  volatility;  but  any 
second-round  effects  on  inflation,  through wage  bargaining  and medium-term  inflation  expectations, 
should of course be prevented.  
What of practice? Well, notwithstanding the rise in inflation in the UK over the past eighteen months, it 
is moot whether any of the major central banks did in fact fully accommodate the first-round effects of 
the  oil  price  rise.  That  the  full  impact  of  the  rise  in  costs  has  not  passed  through  to  inflation  owes 
something, I believe, to wariness amongst central bankers of their being able, given uncertainty about 
the underlying shocks, to calibrate policy with sufficient precision to bring about such a neat but vitally 
important  distinction  between  first-round  and  second-round  effects;  let  alone  of  their  being  able  to 
communicate such a strategy to the public, the business community and financial markets. Textbook 
orthodoxy might perhaps have been more compelling if the rise in energy prices had been both sharp 
and caused purely by interruptions to, or constraints on, the supply of energy. But when, as over the 
past couple of years, the rise in costs was partly the consequence of increased global demand, and 
the  price  rise  drawn  out,  the  wariness  in  fully  accommodating  the  first  round  effects  was,  I  think, 
tangible, and reasonable. 
UK monetary policy  
That has been the backdrop to my own approach to monetary policy over the past year or so. The 
policy  stance  has  needed  to  be  set  and  explained  in  the  context  of  cost  shocks  and  demand

conditions, placing a premium on clarity of communication about monetary strategy.1 I have judged 
that to be a delicate exercise given recent and prospective volatility in headline inflation. This thinking 
informed my vote against an increase in Bank Rate in January. CPI inflation had risen quite sharply, 
but was – and, I should say, still is – also expected to fall back quite sharply towards the 2% target. 
Provided that broadly “humped” path for inflation materialised over the coming months, the upside risk 
to medium-term inflation expectations seemed likely to subside. It was not a matter of my wanting to 
avoid surprising the markets in some narrow sense, which in the greater scheme of things is neither 
here  nor  there.  Rather,  I  was  concerned  that  an  immediate  move  might,  on  balance,  cause 
unnecessary confusion about the Committee’s view of the medium-term outlook for inflation and about 
monetary  strategy.  In  the  event,  subsequent  speeches  by  colleagues,  and  the  medium-term 
perspective of the February Inflation Report, helped to keep that genie in the bottle.  
In February, I was strongly in favour of widening the width of the Inflation Report “fan chart” for inflation 
during  the  coming  year,  to  underline  the  near-term  uncertainty  about,  and  the  great  difficulty  in 
forecasting, the path of utility prices. It was vital to convey the medium-term prospect, and also that we 
stand ready to act if the risks warranted it.  
More recently, with Bank Rate at 5.25% and a modestly upward sloping money market curve, I have 
characterised  monetary  conditions  as  “edging  towards  restrictive”,  so  long  as  inflation  does  as 
expected  fall  back  in  the  near  term.  That  has  been  appropriate  given  the  degree  of  pricing  power 
apparently emergent in conditions of relatively high capacity utilisation amongst firms. It has provided 
the platform needed going forward to restrain inflation pressures, and to maintain anchored inflation 
expectations, at a time when, understandably, there is public debate about the outlook given that CPI 
inflation rose above 3% for the first time, triggering an open letter from the Governor, on behalf of the 
Committee, to the Chancellor.  
Looking ahead, my votes, and my approach to communicating our monetary strategy, will depend on 
balancing  the  medium-term  prospect  for  demand  pressures  alongside  uncertainties  about  supply 
conditions  and  near-term  inflation  expectations  caused  by  volatility  in  energy  costs.  This  will  entail 
making judgments about a whole range of influences, including whether or not residual slack in the 
labour  market  might  in  time,  given  robust  business  investment,  help  to  ease  capacity  constraints; 
whether or not competitive conditions amongst retailers will dampen the feed through of accelerating 
producer prices into consumer prices; and, most crucially of all, whether wage bargainers and price 
setters recognise the absolute determination of the Committee to maintain price stability. 
Risks to the global capital markets 
If anchored inflation expectations have so far been maintained, here and elsewhere, two other risks in, 
and  for,  the  global  financial  environment  continue  to  preoccupy  commentators:  current  account 
imbalances;  and  compressed  risk  premia,  together  with  an  apparently  high  risk  appetite,  in  credit 
markets.  
There are, I would suggest, some interesting contrasts between these two risks, which – following the 
Bank’s Financial Stability Report – I shall call “global imbalances” and “low risk premia”. They can be 
contrasted in two dimensions: the probability that there is some kind of “disequilibrium” that needs to 
correct; and the probability that any such correction, or adjustment, will produce destabilising spillovers 
in the financial system.  
On the first – the probability of adjustment – it is widely agreed by economists that one symptom of 
global imbalances, the US current account deficit, is unsustainable. It cannot continue indefinitely at 
the same rate because eventually the US’s external debt-servicing burden would become too great. 
That there will be adjustment, somehow or other, is therefore viewed by most commentators as near 
certain. By contrast, while the low risk premia across credit markets are hard to explain, no one can 
say  for certain  that  they  are unsustainable.  A  number of  changes  in  the  environment  point  towards 
some sustainable reduction in risk premia: more credible monetary regimes; more flexible labour and 
product markets, helping economies to adjust to nasty shocks; improved instruments and markets for 
managing  risk;  better  diversified  portfolios.  Whether  or  not  that  merits  the  degree  of  risk  premia

Bulletin, Summer 2006, pp 212-224.

compression seen over recent years is open to question. For some while now, I have encountered few 
people in the market who regard credit risk as fairly priced. A distinction is typically drawn – including 
in  the  Bank’s  Financial  Stability  Reports2  –  between  a  “fast  fuse”  risk,  in  which  credit  is  abruptly 
repriced; and a “slow fuse” risk, in which cheap credit leads over time to overleveraged borrowers and 
so  to  vulnerability  to  a  deterioration  in  the  global  economy.  As  time  passes,  attention  has  perhaps 
been shifting to the longer-fuse risk, given signs of a pick up in aggregate corporate sector leverage 
and gradual dilution of covenants in loan terms and conditions, most obviously recently in so-called 
“covenant-lite” transactions in the leveraged loan market.3 But, in contrast to global imbalances, no 
one can say with complete conviction that a lower risk premia environment is definitely unsustainable, 
which may contribute to explaining why few market participants seem prepared to bet on the time or 
scale of any correction.  
In terms of the second dimension – the probability that any adjustment would be disorderly –market 
practitioners  at  least  seem  to  regard  “low  risk  premia”  more  seriously  than  “global  imbalances”. 
Resolution  of  the  problem  of  global  imbalances  could  come  in  various  ways,  not  all  of  which  need 
involve  an  abrupt  correction  in  asset  prices  or  further  movements  in  nominal  exchange  rates.  For 
example, the US might obtain greater competitiveness through a depreciation in the dollar’s real value 
if inflation in China and elsewhere were to be relatively high for a period. But, for my purposes today, 
the  key  point  is  that  any  correction  in  asset  prices  would  most  obviously  be  concentrated,  at  least 
initially,  in  the  foreign  exchange  markets  and,  if  associated  with  a  reduced  appetite  for  dollar-
denominated  assets,  plausibly  in  US  Treasury  yields  too  –  perhaps  amplified  by  various  option-like 
structures.4 But these are, of course, the deepest, most liquid markets in the world. So while sharp 
changes would no doubt inflict losses through parts of financial system, many practitioners seem to 
regard the market dynamics as manageable. Indeed, when in the Bank’s Market Intelligence rounds 
we explore this issue, the mechanism that elicits most concern is that any consequent macroeconomic 
slowdown – brought about in the US by higher risk-free bond yields or in the euro area by exchange 
rate appreciation – might put pressure on the corporate and household sectors after a period in which 
credit  risk  may  have  been  underpriced  and  so  abundantly  available.  In  other  words,  discussion  of 
“global imbalances” shades into an exploration of the potential consequences of “low risk premia”. But 
more important, the fundamental changes in the structure of credit markets over the past half decade 
or  so  have  left  many  practitioners  uncertain  about  the  dynamics  of  any  adjustment.  Views  vary  of 
course,  with  some  seeing  the  system  as  clearly  more  resilient  than  half  a  decade  ago,  but  on  the 
whole practitioners seem to be more uncertain about the potential for nasty spillovers from adjustment 
in “low risk premia” than in “global imbalances”.  
Vehicular finance  
This uncertainty stems from changes not just in instruments and markets, but also in institutions – ie in 
the nature and structure of financial intermediaries. This is the age of what I call Vehicular Finance. 
The  key  intermediaries  are  no  longer  just  banks,  securities  dealers,  insurance  companies,  mutual 
funds  and  pension  funds.  They  include  hedge  funds  of  course,  but  also  Collateralised  Debt 
Obligations,  specialist  Monoline  Financial  Guarantors,  Credit  Derivative  Product  Companies, 
Structured Investment Vehicles, Commercial Paper conduits, Leverage Buyout Funds – and on and 
on.5 These vehicles can fit together like Russian dolls. By way of illustration – and, I fear, slipping for a 
moment into alphabet soup – SIVs may hold monoline-wrapped AAA-tranches of CDOs, which may

movements in the yen; and hedging of Range Accrual Notes, for which the gamma exposure can flip sign, 
might  amplify  yield  curve  movements.  The  general  question  of  the  potential  for  dynamic  hedging  of  short 
option positions to amplify market movements was discussed in Tucker P M W (2005), “Where are the risks?”,

hold  tranches  of  other  CDOs,  which  hold  LBO  debt  of  all  types  as  well  as  asset-backed  securities 
bundling together household loans. (The diagram may, or may not, help!)  
What is going on here? One possible explanation is that capital might be being allocated to wherever 
its cost is cheapest for a particular desired risk profile. That optimisation involves comparing the capital 
charges  applied  by  regulators  to  regulated  institutions;  and  by  rating  agencies  to  various  types  of 
vehicle (SIVs, CPDCs, CDOs, monolines etc). The “smart money” seems to be assembling its own 
portfolio  of  vehicles,  so  that  it  can  choose  from  a  menu  of  where  to  book  transactions.  One  of  the 
drivers is commonly referred to by practitioners as “ratings arbitrage”. Another was of course Basel I, 
which triggered the securitisation of high-quality credits, and for quite a few years fuelled a ballooning 
of vehicles whose existence depended on commercial banks providing zero-capital-weighted “liquidity” 
lines. Basel II will change all of that. Indeed, if central banks are to understand how the global financial 
system  fits  together, we  will  need  to  fathom  the  reconfiguration  that  Basel  II  prompts,  including  the 
potential  for  risk  transfers  between  banks  adopting  different  steps  on  the  ladder  of  Standard, 
Foundation,  Advanced  approaches  that  it  makes  available.  For  the  same  underlying  reasons,  in 
pursuing their mission, central banks now need to follow developments beyond the big banks, and I 
am very grateful to the hedge funds, CDO managers and others who contribute to the Bank’s market 
intelligence effort. 
The dispersion of risk, and central banking instruments  
Does any of this matter? 
a) 
The  dialogue  is,  of  course,  largely  qualitative.  Given  the  variety  of  vehicles  and  their  use  of  risk 
transfer instruments, it has become a commonplace that “we” no longer know where risk lies. Most 
often, the “we” is the official sector, and in particular bank regulators. But “we” might just as well be the 
management of banks and dealers.  
Some commentators plainly see this as a Bad Thing. Is it? At least as put, I am not so sure. 
In  the  first  place,  the  transfer  of  risk  has  been  a  consequence  of  the  development  of  wholesale 
markets, with reasonably broad participation, in all types of credit risk. Provided liquidity is sustained, 
that should aid the system’s adjustment to shocks. It also means that, while regulators, central banks 
and  other  analysts  have  certainly  lost  some  quantity  data,  our  assessment  of  credit  conditions  is 
enriched by the availability of a wealth of new price signals. 
Secondly,  while  credit  risk  transfer  markets  are  new,  derivative  markets  in  interest  rates,  exchange 
rates  and  equity  prices  have  existed  –  on-exchange  and  over-the-counter  –  for  approaching  two 
decades. We have not known where those risks are for quite a long time.  
Thirdly, if we “no longer know where the risk is”, that implies that it has been dispersed beyond the 
regulated sector. One might think that was a Good Thing. To take an extreme scenario, if risks were 
widely and evenly distributed across savings institutions internationally, a very nasty shock causing a 
sharp  fall  in  asset  markets  would  not  obviously  destabilise  the  financial  system.  It  would  obviously 
have macroeconomic consequences, by depleting household wealth and raising the cost of capital for 
firms. Other things being equal, central banks could respond by adopting an easier path for interest 
rates than otherwise, in order to maintain aggregate demand broadly in line with aggregate supply, 
with the objective of keeping inflation in line with explicit or implicit targets. Although the original shock 
may be nasty, the response would be the routine use of the routine instrument: the price of central 
bank money. There is no question of a so-called Greenspan (or any other kind of) “put” here; the focus 
would be not asset prices, but the outlook for spending in the economy and so inflation.  
This is obviously rather different from a similarly nasty shock producing severe disorder in a banking 
system that was carrying unduly concentrated exposures of some kind. For a central banker, banks 
matter because their liabilities are used as money, they are at the centre of the payments system, and 
they  carry  an  associated  asset/liability  maturity  mismatch.6  Banking  system  distress  is  therefore 
typically characterised by a liquidity run. Faced with that, a central bank’s instrument – used, where 
necessary, in collaboration with its regulatory and finance ministry partners – is to supply the system

The banking system’s residual risk, stress testing and transparency 
with an increased quantity of its money, without necessarily changing its price. Given the need to take 
collateral to protect against risk, and to charge a premium to create the right incentives, establishing a 
routine framework for such operations without creating moral hazard remains “work in progress” for 
the international central banking community.7
So it would seem that there is a good deal to welcome in the greater dispersion of risk made possible 
by modern instruments, markets and institutions.  
But there are most certainly qualifications to such an apparently alluring conclusion.  
b) 
The  banking  system  retains  risk  in  a  number  of  ways,  both  pre-  and  post-risk  transfer,  and  its 
aggregate  balance  sheet  has  in  fact  expanded  considerably.8  Pre-risk  transfer,  banks  and  dealers 
hold,  or  finance,  warehouses  of  portfolios  of  loans  to  households  and  corporates  on  their  way  to 
securitisation,9  meaning  that  the  banking  system  can  still  find  itself  “holding  the  parcel”  when  the 
music  stops.  Post-risk  transfer,  some  risk  is  contingently  retained  by  virtue  of  banks  and  dealers 
financing the acquisition of risk by hedge funds and others. This entails counterparty credit risk and, 
taking account of collateral, is akin to writing out-of-the-money put options.  
So, for me, the question is not so much “where is the risk?”, as “in what circumstances could risk flow 
back to the banking system?”; and “do banks have enough capital and liquidity to absorb such flows 
without stress?”  
This  is  relevant  not  only  to  credit  risk,  but  also  to  transfers  of  complex  market  risks.  In  providing 
bespoke  “solutions”  to  their  corporate  and  investment  management  clients,  investment  banks 
accumulate complex market risk exposures that are hedged largely in public, and so relatively “vanilla” 
wholesale markets. These hedges are inevitably imperfect. Some of the residual market risk is now 
occasionally  transferred  to  the  fund  sector,  via  for  example  variance  swaps  or  correlation  swaps, 
transforming market risk into counterparty credit risk – underlining the importance of the work of the 
industry’s Counterparty Risk Management Group in debating and promulgating prudent practices.10
Other  imperfectly  hedged  risks  are  retained,  leaving  intermediaries  with  so-called  “basis  risk”  –  or, 
more prosaically, the risk that assumed correlations break down. Put bluntly, if instruments A and B 
have subtly (or not so subtly) different characteristics but are nicely correlated for a while, B might be 
employed as a “hedge” for A, without the implicit risk exposure turning up in Value At Risk measures. 
When  a  shock  hits  and  the  correlation  breaks  down,  the  hedge  breaks  down  too,  with  a  double 
whammy  to  VaR  and  so,  for  regulated  firms,  to  regulatory  capital  requirements:  through  higher 
volatility, and a higher measured exposure. To be clear, this is not the fancy of the ivory tower. As 
discussed in the Bank’s latest Financial Stability Report, it was one of the factors contributing to the 
recent  volatility  in  the  market  for  US  sub-prime  mortgage  securitisations.  Indeed,  this  hazard  may 
conceivably have increased during a period when markets have not been especially volatile.  
If  investment  banking  entails  warehousing  optionality  and  complex  forms  of  basis  risk,  it  puts  a 
premium on stress testing. Speaking as a policy maker, I would want so-called macro stress tests to 
be  complemented  by  more  fine-grained  stress  tests  in  which  management  explore  the  exposure  to 
complex  risks  given  their  qualitative  understanding  of  their  business,  and  taking  into  account  the 
possibility of impaired market liquidity. In other words, risk managers need to do “market intelligence” 
                                                      
7   The  Bank  of  England  took  some  steps  in  this  direction  as  part  of  the  fundamental  reforms  to  its  Sterling 
Monetary Framework market operations in summer 2006. The role of central banks in accommodating sharp 
(velocity)  shocks  to  the  demand  for  their  money  was  discussed  in  Tucker  P  M  W  (2004),  “Managing  the

within  their  own  firms.  My  sense  is  that  that  view  is  shared  by  at  least  some  Chief  Risk  Officers. 
Greater  transparency  of  such  stress  testing  would  not  only  shed  light  on  the  risks  retained  by  the 
banking system, it might also have a productive effect on incentives – rather as greater transparency 
has enhanced monetary policy making.  
What happens when the music stops: ex ante preparation for stress 
But  of  course  severe  stress  cannot  be  ruled  out.  Central  banks  and  practitioners  therefore  expend 
effort thinking about what will happen if and when the music stops. 
As the Bank’s latest Financial Stability Report discusses, the official sector has stepped up its practice 
exercises of various kinds. The private sector analogue to crisis resolution is the “workout”, in which a 
company  is  restructured  under  the  shadow  of  insolvency.  In  a  world  characterised  by  bank 
intermediation, workouts typically involved bank syndicates co-ordinated by a few lead banks. Even 
country workouts in the early 1980s had that broad shape, albeit with the IMF holding the ring. One 
might wonder how on earth it would work today, in a world of traded debt, synthetic risk transfer, and 
vehicular  finance.  Much  thinking  remains  to  be  done  on  this,  but  a  policymaker  has  to  form  a 
preliminary view, just in case the music stops tomorrow. My provisional view is that some investors in 
credit risk would find themselves without the skill set to participate in a workout. In a “covenant-lite” 
world,  they  might  also  find  themselves  with  fewer  protections  as  conditions  deteriorated  than  they 
would like ex post. Unless markets seized up, however, they might be able to crystallise their losses 
by selling out to funds and bank desks who trade in “distressed credit”; and they in turn might be able 
to sell on to funds and banks with specialist workout skills and risk appetites. By such transfers, the 
end-game  co-ordination  problems  might  be  reduced.  On  the  way,  some  hard  bargains  would  be 
struck, and some participants would no doubt be surprised by their losses.  
But this relatively benign scenario is not guaranteed. It depends on markets continuing to function; on 
the  infrastructure  holding  up  through  volume  surges  and  stress;  on  the  shadow  of  the  insolvency 
regimes  in  various  jurisdictions  establishing  productive  incentives;  and  on  lack  of  uncertainty  in  the 
terms and conditions of market contracts.  
That last point needs underlining. In today’s markets, there is a large premium on ex ante clarity and 
certainty, as opposed to ex post negotiation amongst bankers who know and trust each other. The 
work required is detailed and largely out of the limelight. But getting clarity around things like “close out 
netting” may make all the difference when the music stops.11 The official community therefore needs 
to  maintain  its  encouragement  and  support  for  private  sector  initiatives  to  standardise  and  improve 
documentation. To take just a few examples from what could be a long list, this includes the work of 
New  York’s  Global  Documentation  Steering  Group;  of  various  market  trade  associations;  and  of 
London’s Securities Lending and Repo Committee, which helps co-ordinate the work of different parts 
of the collateral-financing markets.12
Summary 
I  have  travelled  from  macro  to  micro.  To  maintain  the  two  elements  of  monetary  stability  –  price 
stability, and financial stability – we need credible and effective institutions. 
                                                      
11   Close-out  netting  is  a  process  by  which,  following  a  default,  open  transactions  between  two  parties  are 
terminated, each transaction is valued and, together with any outstanding payments, these are reduced to a 
single net amount owed by one of the parties to the other. Obtaining legal certainty over recognition of netting 
across different products and, in particular, with different legal entities with a common group is very important. 
12   The  Global  Documentation  Steering  Group  (GDSC)  is  an  industry  group formed  in  1999  to  implement  the 
documentation-related  recommendations  of  the  report  of  Counterparty  Risk  Management  Policy  Group 
(CRMPG).  The  primary  objective  of  the  Committee  is  to  encourage  the  harmonisation  of  documentation  in 
standard  over-the-counter contracts  in  order  to  minimise  disparities  that  can exacerbate  market,  credit  and 
legal risk. It took the lead in updating the recommendations on documentation issues for the second CRMPG 
report released in 2005. GDSC is sponsored by, but independent of, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
The hedge fund community is represented on the GDSG. The Stock Lending and Repo Committee, facilitated 
and chaired by the Bank of England, provides a forum for practitioners and the authorities to discuss structural 
(including legal) developments in London-based securities lending and repo markets.

At the macro end of the spectrum, that above all means credible monetary regimes. The MPC is now 
ten years old. During that period, inflation expectations have been well anchored to our target. And no 
one should be in any doubt that the Committee is determined to keep it that way. 
But  a  credible  monetary  regime  does  not  insulate  the  economy,  or  financial  markets,  against  all 
shocks. Over the coming decade, some currently observable imbalances will plausibly work their way 
through  the  system,  as  the  pattern  of  global  saving  shifts,  asset  prices  adjust,  and  we  encounter, 
eventually, a period of corporate defaults. In ten years time, we may therefore know whether “global 
imbalances”  and  “low  risk  premia”  were  resolved  with  or  without  stress;  and  we  may  be  better 
informed  on  whether  the  changes  in  the  structure  of  our  financial  markets  help  or  hinder  the 
preservation of stability. A benign outcome would be more likely if the industry were to maintain its 
efforts on improving ex ante measures to handle stress. Managers of hedge funds and other modern 
investment vehicles, as well as banks, have a clear stake in that work.  
Annex: Vehicles 
CDO: Collateralised debt obligation. 
Typically,  a  structured  finance  product  where  a  SPV  issues  notes  backed  by,  or  referenced  to,  a 
portfolio of underlying assets. The notes issued are tranched by seniority into senior, mezzanine and 
equity. The underlying assets could be corporate bonds, loans or structured finance securities (such 
as  mortgage-backed  securities  or  notes  issued  by  other  CDOs),  and  they  might  be  owned  either 
directly or synthetically via credit default swaps.  
CDO squared. 
A CDO invested in CDO tranches, typically mezzanine tranches of synthetic CDOs.  
CDPC: Credit Derivative Product Companies. 
A  highly-rated  limited  purpose  company,  with  permanent  capital,  that  sells  credit  protection  on 
individual names or synthetic CDO tranches. CDPCs differ from monolines in that they write protection 
only via credit default swaps. They are in some respects akin to synthetic banks.  
Closed-end fund. 
An investment company that issues shares to investors and invests the proceeds in a pool of assets 
typically  stocks  and/or  bonds.  Recently  some  funds  have  invested  in  “alternative”  assets  such  as 
hedge funds, private equity and infrastructure, and structured credit. Shares in closed-end funds are 
traded like other equities. The funds may issue their own debt to obtain leverage. They may also issue 
different classes of shares with different entitlements to income or capital receipts from the underlying 
investments.  
CP (Commercial paper) conduit. 
A SPV that issues CP backed by financial assets originated by one or more sellers. They are generally 
supported by liquidity facilities provided by their sponsor or a third-party bank.  
DPC: Derivative product company.  
A  bankruptcy-remote  structure  that  houses  credit  risk  from  long-dated  derivative  transactions.  They 
are typically wholly-owned subsidiaries of financial services companies. In general, DPCs sit between 
their sponsor and an external counterparty in derivative transactions and protect the counterparty from 
the potential default of the derivative seller (the sponsor).  
Monoline insurance companies. 
Monoline insurance companies provide protection against a specific type of risk (typically credit risk). 
Originally  developed  in  the  1970s  to  provide  US  municipal  bond  holders  with  credit  guarantees  (or

“wraps”), over the past few decades they have diversified into the ABS and CDO markets (particularly 
the highly-rated senior tranches).  
SIV: Structured Investment Vehicle.  
A SPV that funds a diversified portfolio of highly rated assets by issuing short-term commercial paper, 
medium-term notes etc. In general, there is a maturity mismatch between their assets and liabilities. 
They aim to generate a positive spread between their return on assets and funding costs.  
SPV: Special purpose vehicle.  
A  bankruptcy-remote  company  created  for  the  sole  purpose  of  acquiring  assets  or  derivative 
exposures and issuing liabilities linked to these assets. Also known as a special purpose entity.
