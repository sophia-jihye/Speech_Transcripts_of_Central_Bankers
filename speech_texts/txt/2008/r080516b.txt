Glenn Stevens: The Australian economy – then and now  
Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Inaugural 
Faculty  of  Economics  and  Business  Alumni  Dinner,  University  of  Sydney,  Sydney,  15 May 
2008. 
I thank Clare Noone for assistance. 
 Chancellor,  Vice-Chancellor,  Deputy  Chancellor,  Deputy  Vice-Chancellors,  Dean  of  the 
Faculty of Economics and Business, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. 
I think the last time I was in this Hall may have been for my graduation. If not then, it was 
probably for an examination. Either way, tonight’s occasion is far more convivial and I thank 
the University for the invitation. 
One of my classmates of old suggested that a good topic for this conversation might be a 
comparison of the Australian economy of the late 1970s, when we were students, with that of 
today.  The  more  I  thought  about  that  suggestion,  the  better  it  seemed  and  so  that 
comparison  is  exactly  what  I  propose  to  offer.  In  the  moment-by-moment  focus  on  the 
economic data, and all the wiggles and ticks up and down of this indicator or that, we can 
often  neglect  to  stand  back  and  look  at  the  big  picture.  So  let  us  rectify  that  for  the  next 
25 minutes or so.  
The  approach  is  to  use  charts  and  tables  to  compare  two  decades –  the  1970s  and  the 
2000s – so as to offer some perspectives on how things have changed and, perhaps, on how 
they are similar.  
Economic structure 
Table 1 gives a comparison of the structure of the economy by industry then and now. The 
two most striking changes are the decline in the share of output provided by manufacturing, 
and  the  rise  in  financial  and  business  services.  This  trend  has  occurred  in  all  developed 
countries.  Agriculture  is  smaller  than  it  was  then,  though  2007  was  a  drought  year,  which 
affects that comparison. Communication services have become more important. (The mobile 
phone  was  not  invented  in  1977,  of  course.  What  did  students  do  between  lectures,  I 
wonder?) Mining is larger today, though not by much.

Beyond these shifts, not all that much has changed at the broad structural level. Australia 
even 30 years ago had quite a substantial services sector, and still does.  
But the opening up of Australia to international trade, as a result of the policies of tariff reform 
and  product  market  liberalisation  since  the  mid  1980s,  has  been  a  significant  change 
(Graph 1).  The  change  in  our  trade  patterns  has  been  substantial  (Table 2).  In  the  late 
1970s,  over  60 per  cent  of  Australia’s  trade  was  conducted  with  the  United  States,  major 
European countries and Japan. While these countries continue to be important to Australia 
today, their share of Australia’s trade has fallen by a third and is now eclipsed by our trade 
with  China  and  emerging  east  Asia.  This  feature  reflects the  growing  importance  of  China 
and emerging east Asia more generally – together, their share of global GDP has trebled to 
almost 18 per cent since the end of the 1970s.

External  influences  on  Australia  are  also  reflected  in  our  terms  of  trade  (Graph 2).  A  key 
feature of the early 1970s was the spike in our terms of trade as supply disturbances pushed 
up world commodity prices. Today, rising commodity prices are again a feature of the global 
economy. However, this time around, much of the rise in our terms of trade appears likely to 
be more sustained, resting as it does on the demand arising from the long-term emergence 
of large economies like China and India. 
The  more  open  economy  today  also  means  we  are  more  exposed  to  these  forces.  In 
addition,  the  opening  of  the  capital  account  in  the  early  1980s  has  led  to  a  degree  of 
integration  of  the  Australian  financial  system  with  the  world  in  a  way  which  offers  a  much 
larger choice set to savers and investors.

Macroeconomic trends 
My next set of comparisons is of major macroeconomic aggregates. The first is growth in real 
non-farm GDP. I use non-farm GDP simply because farm GDP can be highly volatile due to 
droughts  and  floods.  That,  as  rural  producers  know  only  too  well,  has  been  a  constant 
feature of the Australian experience.  
On  average,  growth  in  the  economy  in  the  two  periods  under  review  was  very  similar,  at 
about 3.4 per cent (Graph 3). But there was a marked change in the middle of the 1970s. 
After a number of years of very rapid growth, the economy encountered much more adverse 
circumstances  from  1974  onwards.  That  was  true  for  most  countries,  though  Australia’s 
relative performance on some metrics deteriorated. From 1975 to 1979, the average growth 
rate was a full percentage point lower than in the period from 1971 to 1974. The period was 
also noteworthy for the close proximity of two episodes of cyclical weakness, in 1974/75 and 
1977. There was also a recession in the early 1980s.

The current decade so far has seen average growth of 3.4 per cent, though the next couple 
of years will probably see growth noticeably lower than that. What is quite noticeable from 
the chart is the relative stability of growth in recent years, something that was a feature of the 
second half of the 1990s as well. This pattern was observed in many economies over the 
same period. Of course, the 1970s makes for a flattering benchmark in that it was the most 
unstable  period  in  macroeconomic  terms  in  the  entire  post-War  period,  so  even  average 
performance will look better than that. But, in fact, the period since the mid 1990s has been 
very stable by any standard. Those who have looked into this in detail have posited several 
possible  contributing  factors,  including  better  macroeconomic  policy  frameworks,  a  wide 
range of microeconomic reforms in labour and product markets, and luck.  
The weak growth of the latter 1970s was associated with an upward trend in unemployment 
(Graph 4). From a low of 2 per cent in the early 1970s, it rose to about 5 per cent in the mid-
1970s  recession,  and  then  drifted  higher  over  the  remaining  part  of  the  decade.  Similar 
trends were observed abroad. The big rise in real wages in the mid 1970s, part of which was 
exogenously imposed as a result of government policy at the time, also had a fair bit to do 
with higher unemployment.

The  trend  in  unemployment  in  the  most  recent  decade  has  generally  been  downward. 
Following a rise of a percentage point in the economic slowdown in 2001, it has fallen to the 
lowest levels since the mid 1970s. The long expansion, with occasional temporary pauses, 
has  done  a  lot  to  foster  lower  unemployment.  But  the  changes  in  labour  market 
arrangements over the past 20 years or so have also been very important. Indeed, I would 
argue  that  they  are  a  key  contributor,  not  least  because  they  have  facilitated  the  longer 
length of economic expansions.  
The difference in inflation rates between the two decades is particularly striking (Graph 5). 
Being  a  central  banker  I  suppose  I  would  say  that,  but  I  think  it  is  too  easy  to  forget  the 
corrosive effect that high inflation had on the economy in those days. Until the mid 1960s, 
Australia had been a low-inflation country. The seeds of the 1970s inflation were sown in the 
latter part of the 1960s, they took root in the early 1970s and then the events of the early and 
mid 1970s pushed inflation up steeply. From the end of 1970 to the end of 1979, the average 
rise in the CPI was 10.7 per cent a year, which meant that the value of money fell by 60 per 
cent  over  that  period.  The  peak  inflation  rate  in  any  one  year  was  17.6 per  cent,  and  the 
lowest achieved was just under 5 per cent.

 In  contrast,  the  current  decade  shows  a  pretty  flat  line  for  inflation  when  put  on  the  same 
scale as the 1970s. We still have our cyclical ups and downs, but the average rate has been 
3.0 per  cent  since  the  beginning  of  2001.  Even  with  the  recent  surge  in  consumer  prices 
taking the inflation rate to a bit over 4 per cent, things are not like they were in the 1970s. 
That’s  just  as  well,  of  course,  because  with  entrenched  high  inflation  would  come  lots  of 
distortions and wasted resources as people in the economy adjusted their behaviour to live 
with  high  inflation.  One  of  the  adjustments  would  be  that  savers  would  demand  higher 
nominal interest rates, higher than the ones we currently see, to part with their money.  
So the period between about 1973 and 1983, when the economists of my generation were 
studying  and  then  getting  their  first  jobs  as  economists,  was  a  pretty  poor  one  for 
macroeconomic  performance.  The  past  decade,  in  contrast,  has  been  much  better.  Once 
again,  a  more  favourable  international  environment  has  been  a  factor  there,  but  so  have 
better economic policies. Let me turn, then, to economic policies.  
Macroeconomic policies 
When we were students, we were taught about the four arms of economic policy, which were 
fiscal, monetary, exchange rate and wages policies. We still have fiscal and monetary policy, 
about which I will say something in a moment. But by the early 1980s, enough people had 
accepted that you could not really choose the exchange rate and monetary policy settings 
independently. You either allowed financial conditions to adjust to whatever was dictated by 
a given exchange rate, or you set domestic financial conditions according to the needs of the 
economy and let the exchange rate adjust to that. The decision to float the exchange rate, 
made  in  1983,  was  a  decision  to  do  the  latter.  Of  course,  there  have  been  subsequent 
occasions when, via intervention, we have sought to influence the exchange rate, but they 
have  been  confined  to  fairly  brief  periods  and  have  become  less  frequent  as  time  has 
passed.  
Wages policy was important for the wrong reasons in the 1970s, in that government pushed 
up minimum wages too  quickly for a while. In the 1980s, wages policies negotiated in the 
form of the Prices and Incomes Accord between the Hawke/Keating Governments and the 
ACTU were effective in containing wages growth and allowing some restoration of the share 
of national income accruing to profits. This did a lot to generate employment and growth. It 
seems  unlikely  that  such  a  degree  of  influence  over  wages  as  an  instrument  of 
BIS Review 60/2008

macroeconomic  policy  will  return.  These  days,  policies  over  industrial  matters  are  more 
structural in nature, aimed at making arrangements in the labour market reasonably flexible, 
balancing economic efficiency and fairness, and providing a safety net for the lowest paid.  
So that leaves monetary and fiscal policy. When I was a student, furious debates had long 
been  boiling  away  in  the  halls  of  academia  over  questions  like:  does  money  matter?  Was 
monetary or fiscal policy more effective as a stabilisation tool? Was the apparent trade-off 
between inflation and unemployment, which appeared so tantalisingly in the data, something 
that could be exploited systematically, or would it prove ephemeral? Was discretion best in 
the conduct of monetary policy, or should some sort of rule be employed?  
The 1970s and early 1980s provided important real data and experience in the resolution of 
these questions. Friedman and Phelps had already long argued that there was no long-run 
trade-off  and  that  attempts  to  reduce  unemployment  below  some  structural  level  by 
accepting higher inflation would simply result in accelerating inflation and no lasting gain on 
unemployment.  The  1970s  seemed  to  demonstrate  that  this  was  right.  More  strident 
derivatives  of  the  Chicago  tradition,  however,  which  insisted  that  there  was  not  even  any 
short-term trade-off, were found to be wide of the mark.  
Money did seem to matter, since the big rise in inflation in the 1970s had been preceded by a 
large increase in money growth. A lot of people not only accepted that monetary quantities 
were the key thing to look at, but concluded that central banks had failed to control them, so 
that  some  sort  of  step  away  from  unconstrained  discretion  towards  monetary  rules  was 
advisable. As a result, targets for those quantities were adopted, including in Australia. That 
was the language of discussion when I was a student and when I first started work at the 
Reserve Bank in 1980.1  
These  days,  we  have  inflation  targeting,  an  arrangement  that  provides  a  measure  of 
constrained  discretion  to  the  central  bank  within  a  medium-term  framework.  It  emphasises 
the control of inflation over time, but does not seek to fine-tune inflation over short periods. 
That  allows  a  reasonable  accommodation  for  trends  in  economic  activity  and  employment 
over periods of a year or two, about which the Reserve Bank is required to have concern by 
its Charter as well as by common sense, but preserves the value of the currency over the 
long  run.  In  the  language  of  trade-offs,  this  system  accepts  there  is  a  short-term 
growth/inflation trade-off, but also accepts there is no long-term one. Inflation targeting does 
not  ignore  financial  quantities,  but  does  not  elevate  them  to  the  status  of  an  intermediate 
target  and  does  not  see  them  as  an  instrument.  Inflation  targeting  is  not  perfect  and,  on 
occasion, still leaves policy-makers with some quite difficult decisions to make. It is, however, 
the best system that has been devised as yet.  
The fiscal debate of the 1970s was dominated by the budget deficits of the period, and the 
need to reduce them. On contemporary figuring, the Commonwealth’s budget deficit reached 
about 4-5 per cent of GDP in the middle years of the decade. Using figures comparable to 
those  in  use  today,  which  measure  the  underlying  cash  balance  of  the  Commonwealth 
general government sector, the deficits of the mid 1970s amounted to only about 2 per cent 
of  GDP  (Graph 6).  But  until  1974,  the  Australian  general  government  sector  had  recorded 
more or less continual significant surpluses, so the turn to deficit in 1975/76, for the first time 
since  the  early  1950s,  was  substantial  and,  at  the  time,  quite  controversial.  Reducing  the 
deficit in the sluggish economy of the late 1970s was hard. Deficits grew much larger in the 
recessions of the early 1980s and early 1990s.  
                                                 
1  Australia’s  success  in  using  monetary  targeting  was  mixed,  as  it  was  in  most  countries.  The  tools  to  exert 
control over those measures of money were not really available. The liberalisation of the 1980s solved these 
problems but also shifted the relationships between the monetary aggregates and the economy, which meant 
there  was  no  confidence  that  hitting  a  monetary  target  would  produce  the  outcomes  we  really  wanted  on 
inflation. In this environment, policy struggled for many years to unwind the rise in inflation of the 1970s. It was 
not decisively brought down until 1992, which was long after monetary targeting had been discontinued.

Since 1997/98, in contrast, the federal budget has been in surplus continually, apart from a 
very small deficit in one year. The government’s net debt has been retired. Gross debt on 
issue is maintained at a small size in order to facilitate a functioning bond market so as to 
allow efficient risk pricing more generally. As with monetary policy, there is a medium-term 
framework for fiscal policy emphasising balance over the business cycle. There is much less 
inclination today than there once was to use fiscal policy as a counter-cyclical stabilisation 
tool.  
Significant  fiscal  challenges  in  the  long-term  include  health  spending  and  responding  to 
population  ageing,  as  the  very  important  work  by  officers  of  the  Australian  Treasury  has 
made clear. But there would be very few countries, if any, which would not envy Australia’s 
fiscal position. The capacity to respond, if need be, to developments in the future is virtually 
without peer. This seems light years from the situation in the late 1970s.  
I  have  said  little  here  about  the  changes  to  microeconomic  policies,  which  do  so  much  to 
determine  the  economy’s  supply-side  responsiveness.  That  is  because  my  field  of  interest 
and  expertise  is  in  the  macro  sphere.  But  these  microeconomic  changes  were  equally  as 
important as the macro ones, maybe even more important. I mentioned the change in labour 
market policy, but this was accompanied by a host of other changes to factor markets (like 
financial liberalisation) and product markets (tariff reform, competition policies and so on). It 
is actually these policies that have done most to improve the living standards of Australians. 
The  contrast  between  the  Australian  economy  of  1977 –  heavily  regulated,  suffering  poor 
productivity  growth,  sheltering  behind  high  barriers  to  foreign  competition –  and  the  much 
more open and productive one of today is striking.  
The teaching of economics 
The final comparison I offer is in the teaching of economics. Of course I do not sit in lectures 
or tutorials, so I am unable to judge whether or not the face-to-face teaching has changed 
since the late 1970s. But one interesting exercise is to compare the text books used today 
with those in the past.2 I understand that at the University of Sydney a popular text is the

Australian  Edition  of  Ben Bernanke’s  Principles  of  Macroeconomics  (co-authored  with 
Robert Frank,  with  the  Australian  edition  adapted  by  Nilss Olekans).  When  I  studied 
macroeconomics in 1977, the text in use was Fred R. Glahe’s Macroeconomics, published in 
1973.  
One interesting difference that is obvious immediately is the less formal layout. I think it is fair 
to  describe  Glahe’s  text  as  rather  formidable  and  austere,  and  perhaps  not  a  particularly 
inviting read. In contrast, the book by Bernanke et al is much more welcoming, challenging 
students with thought-provoking questions and illustrations on how economic theory relates 
to  tangible  real  world  events.3  Perhaps  the  less  formal  presentation  style  says  something 
about how society has changed over the past three decades, but I think it also reflects an 
economic  force  at  work,  and  that  is  competition.  There  is  a  proliferation  of  new 
macroeconomic textbooks, many by highly regarded economists. This competition seems to 
have spurred authors to try to produce the most appealing text for students and lecturers in 
order to capture market share. To the extent that these texts may help to cultivate an interest 
in economics, this has been a positive development.  
On content, both include discussion of the “money multiplier”, as an introduction to the theory 
of fractional reserve banking. I suppose students have to learn that, and it is easy to teach, 
but most practitioners find it to be a pretty unsatisfactory description of how the monetary and 
credit  system  actually  works.  In  large  part,  this  is  because  it  ignores  the  role  of  financial 
prices  in  the  process.4  Bernanke  et al  do,  however,  discuss  some  aspects  of  financial 
markets, and I note that in the most recent US edition of the text this has expanded to cover 
asset prices, the diversification of risk and the role financial markets play in ensuring savings 
are allocated to their most productive uses. In the shadow of the current dislocation in global 
financial markets, this is obviously a pretty valuable addition to the curriculum. Ben Bernanke 
has also, of course, made major contributions to academic literature in these areas over the 
years.  
The 1970s book was full of discussion about monetarists versus Keynesians, and of short-
run and long-run Phillips curves. The later book confines them to a section called Lessons 
from the Past.5 Whereas Glahe’s 1970s text makes extensive use of the IS-LM framework 
from Sir John Hicks’ exposition of “Mr Keynes and the Classics” in the 1930s, IS-LM per se 
does not rate a mention in the modern undergraduate text book.  
But perhaps the biggest difference is in the treatment of the open economy, exchange rates 
and  so  on.  In  Glahe’s  1973  book,  the  analysis  is  conducted  entirely  in  a  closed  economy 
setting.  The  term  “exchange  rate”  is  not  one  that  appears  in  the  index.  Today,  even  the 
United States sees itself as an open economy, and the Bernanke et al book treats the issue 
carefully and even contains some international comparisons of data.  
What  do  we  take  from  all  that?  At  the  risk  of  offering  a  set  of  sweeping  generalisations,  I 
would observe, first, that some of the things which so preoccupied us in the 1970s about the 
role of monetary policy, the nature of trade-offs, both short and long term, between inflation 
and growth or unemployment have been regarded by the mainstream of the profession as 
                                                 
3  Missing from the Australian edition is the set of pithy cartoons illustrating simple economic truths, which is a 
shame.  
4  For  what  it  is  worth,  I  think  that  the  Wicksellian  notion  of  the  natural  rate  of  return  on  capital,  the  market 
interest rate and the dynamics set in train by the differences between those two rates is one of the more useful 
analytical devices for understanding the modern economy with a private credit system. Wicksell wrote about it 
more  than  a  century  ago.  (Knut  Wicksell,  Geldzins  und  Güterpreise:  Eine  Untersuchung  über  die  den 
Tauschwert des Geldes bestimmenden Ursachen, 1898, published in English as Interest and Prices: A Study 
of the Causes Regulating the Value of Money, 1936.) Neither of these books covers that idea, though to be 
fair I learnt about that in my honours year, rather than in intermediate undergraduate macro courses. (I trust 
students today are still taught this at some point.)  
In fact, the most recent US edition of the text makes no explicit mention of these debates at all.

pretty much settled. At least, they have been as settled as things ever get. It is to be hoped, 
of course, that we do not have to re-learn those lessons, which is why I have been making 
the case to resist inflation even though that is not comfortable or convenient in the short run.  
Second,  the  theory  and  practice  of  mainstream  macroeconomics  has  become  more 
international in focus. This trend will surely continue, in response to the course of events. Not 
only have the effects of bad loans to American home buyers had reverberations much further 
afield, but the rapidly growing size of the emerging world is affecting economic activity and 
prices far beyond their own borders. I would hazard a guess that the textbooks of 30 years 
from now (if we are still using books) will devote large slabs of material to that emergence, 
and to how well the “old industrial countries” adjusted to it. They will also, no doubt, cover the 
economics of climate change and its abatement at some length.  
Conclusion 
That is my thumb-nail sketch of the Australian economy, and economics generally, then and 
now. Of course, this is not a very rigorous treatment and many things have been omitted. But 
this is supposed to be a relaxed occasion.  
Re-reading  some  of  the  material,  and  looking  at  the  data,  takes  one  back.  I  should  not 
mention many particular names, but Professor Warren Hogan, still active in developing policy 
thinking,  was  one  figure  of  importance.  Peter Groenewegen’s  courses  in  the  History  of 
Economic Thought were memorable, as was the course in Economic Classics that he taught 
with Colin Simkin. Those courses introduced me and others to Smith, Ricardo and Wicksell, 
as  well  as  to  the  then-standard  fare  of  Keynesians  and  monetarists.  And  who  among  the 
honours  classes  of  the  late  1970s  will  forget  the  aroma  of  coffee  brewing  in  the  corner  of 
Prof Simkin’s  study,  his  desk  clouded  in  cigarette  smoke,  the  students  sitting,  terrified, 
waiting for the interrogation ahead about the use of Kakutani’s fixed point theorem to prove 
the existence of general equilibrium? Some things are harder than monetary policy!  
It was an enormous privilege to attend the University of Sydney, to have made some very 
good friends (whom I have still), and to have encountered some remarkable teachers who 
introduced  us  to  the  study  of  economics.  It  was  marvellous  to  have  been  a  part,  however 
small and fleeting, of the life of this place three decades ago, and a great honour to have 
resumed that association in this way tonight.
