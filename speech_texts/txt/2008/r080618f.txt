Caleb M Fundanga: The new K10,000 banknote in Zambia 
Opening remarks by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the official 
launch of the new K10,000 banknote, Bank of Zambia, Lusaka, 16 June 2008. 
 • Members of the Press 
• Official from commercial banks present 
• Ladies and Gentlemen 
I wish to welcome you all to the Bank of Zambia. 
The  objective  of  this  Press  Briefing  is  to  announce  the  introduction  of  the  new  K10,000 
banknote in our economy. The new K10,000 banknote will be put into circulation as early as 
this week. By showing you the new K10,000 banknote first, we expect that you will, in turn, 
help us to inform the public about this new banknote. 
In order for us to help you understand the new K10,000 banknote, we have produced posters 
and  will  make  a  short  power  point  presentation.  The  posters  are  showing  the  main  public 
recognition and security features of the new K10,000 banknote. 
Let me from the outset inform you that although we are calling it a new K10,000 banknote, 
most  of  the  features  on  the  banknote  are  still  the  same  as  those  on  the  current  K10,000 
banknotes. The differences can best be detected by comparing this new K10,000 banknote 
with the current K10,000 banknotes in circulation. 
Ladies and Gentlemen The new features on the K10,000 banknote are as follows: 
(1) 
On the front of the banknote – there is a new bright silver demetallised holographic 
lead representing a fish eagle. This has replaced the old hologram of the head of a 
fish eagle. 
On the back of the banknote –the area around the value numeral, K10,000 in the 
right top corner, is printed with a special ink which shifts colour from copper to green 
when angle of view is changed. 
(2) 
These are the two changes that have been made to the K10,000 banknote. All other features 
are  basically  the  same.  The  reason  for  the  introduction  of  these  two  features  is  mainly  to 
enhance the security of the banknote. 
The Bank of Zambia would further like to inform the public that the new K10,000 banknote 
and  the  current  circulating  K10,000  banknotes  shall  circulate  side  by  side.  The  new  and 
current banknotes will therefore all be legal tender. The current K10,000 banknotes will be 
replaced  by  the  new  K10,000  banknote  once  they  reach  the  end  of  their  lifespan  through 
soiling and/or mutilation. 
Therefore, I urge you to take a closer look at the new K10,000 banknote in order to inform 
the public correctly. 
I thank you.
