X P Guma: Banking in Africa and its future outlook 
Address  by  Dr  X  P  Guma,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  South  African  Reserve  Bank,  to  the 
African Banking Congress 2008, Johannesburg, 8 July 2008. 
 1. 
Distinguished  guests,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  I  have  been  asked  to  speak  today  on 
Central Bank perspectives on the outlook for banking in Africa, focusing in particular on the 
following  issues:  the  role  of  central  banks  and  major  banks  in  regional  integration;  latest 
trends and experiences, and lessons learnt. 
Having taken note of the formidable array of speakers who are to take to the podium during 
the course of the day, I have taken the liberty to reduce the scope of my remarks by focusing 
on the situation in South Africa and the prospects for the Southern African region. Others will, 
no doubt, enlighten us regarding developments elsewhere. 
The role of Central Banks and major banks 
2. 
South Africa currently has 20 registered banks, 14 local branches of foreign banks and 46 
representative offices of foreign banks, supervision of banks being the responsibility of the 
Registrar  of  Banks,  a  constituent  component  of  the  South  African  Reserve  Bank  (SARB). 
The relationship between these two is described in the Banks Act 94 of 1990 in the following 
terms (Chapter II.S4): 
“The  Reserve  Bank  shall,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Minister  (of 
Finance)  designate  an  officer  or  employee  in  its  service  as  Registrar  of 
Banks,  who  shall  perform,  under  the  control  of  the  said  Bank  and  in 
accordance  with  the  directions  issued  by  the  Bank  from  time  to  time,  the 
functions assigned to the Registrar by or under this Act …” 
The SARB in turn is defined in Section 223 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 
1996  as  “…  the  central  bank  of  the  Republic  and  is  regulated  in  terms  of  an  act  of 
Parliament”, and “the powers and functions of the SARB are those customarily exercised and 
performed by central banks …” (Section 225). 
Five  of  the  largest  banks  account  for  the  greater  share  of  the  banking  sector  assets  of 
R2860.5 billion as at May 2008, a pattern which has been consistent over time. The salient 
features of this banking sector are summarised in Tables 1 and 2. 
This outcome may be viewed in contrast to the situation described by Dr A.J. Bruwer in his 
polemic,  South  Africa:  A  Case  for  a  National  Gold  and  Banking  Policy  (1957),  although 
echoes  of  the  sentiments  that  he  expressed  have  some  resonance  in  certain  sections  of 
contemporary South Africa: 
“… it becomes abundantly clear that the two British Imperial Banks … have 
practically  a  monopolistic  hold  on  the  commercial  banking  of  the  country 
and control over 82 per cent of its banking assets. The imperial hold on the 
banking  and  currency  structure  of  the  country  was  made  practically 
complete in 1920 with the establishment of the South African Reserve Bank 
….” And, he continued: 
“If South Africa today has a hopeless inferiority complex with regard to her 
capacity to run her own banking and currency system along national lines, 
the country cannot be blamed … (Preface) 
Bruwer’s preferred outcome was stated thus: 
 BIS Review 91/2008

“What is needed in South Africa more than a central bank (although there is 
no  harm  in  retaining  a  bank  with  independent  central  banking  powers  in 
South Africa) is a powerful extra unit in the field of commercial banking – a 
unit that will be able within a minimum of time to enter the remotest hamlet 
in  the  country  in  competition  with  the  two  all-powerful  Imperial  banks 
(p.192). 
I have quoted Bruwer at length for two reasons; first to indicate the fact that we must expect 
criticism to be directed at our financial systems from time to time, more so during periods of 
economic stress. Central Banks, in particular may be deemed to be purveyors of all sorts of 
undesired policies and actions, some being more fantastic than others. 
My  second  reason  is  to  remind  this  heterogeneous  group  of  eminent  persons  with  direct 
interest in the financial system that it is important to take into account local concerns when 
imagining and implementing the architecture of our financial infrastructure, subject always to 
the need to ensure probity, efficiency and stability in the system as a whole. What works well 
in one country during a particular period of time may not best be suited to another country 
and may be less suited to local conditions as time elapses. Stated differently, in the absence 
of uniform conditions, local improvisations and adjustments are, of course, to be resorted to 
depending upon factors such as the particular stage of development of a country, the make-
up of its banking and credit structure generally, and the degree of organisation of its money 
market, inter alia. 
At  present,  let  it  be  stressed,  South  Africa  has  no  inferiority  complex  with  regard  to  her 
capacity  to  run  her  own  banking  and  currency  system  and  the  authorities  are  alive  to  the 
need  to  do  better.  Let  it  be  said  also  that  the  banking  system  continues  to  facilitate 
intermediation  between  surplus  and  deficit  financial  units –  not  by  administrative  diktat,  as 
some  would  prefer.  Rather,  allocative  efficiency  is  sought  through  the  price  mechanism 
which  operates  best  at  arms  length.  The  role  of  the  central  bank  is  then  multi-faceted:  in 
particular supervising the banks, large and small alike, implementing monetary policy for the 
economy as a whole – within a framework of inflation targeting – and maintaining the national 
payment system. 
Some recent developments 
2.1.  
Three  recent  domestic  developments  warrant  mention.  The  first  two  have  to  do  with 
legislation, whilst the third has to do with competition. 
As noted in the South African Reserve Bank’s Financial Stability Review, March 2008, the 
Banks Amendment Act, No. 20 of 2007, was promulgated and assented to in 2007 following 
extensive  consultation  with  relevant  stakeholders  over  a  number  of  years  and  came  into 
effect on 1 January 2008. The amended legal framework gives effect to current international 
standards and best practice relating to banking supervision and regulation, and in particular 
to  the  new  capital  framework  as  envisioned  in  Basel  II.  In  addition,  the  financial  services 
industry  is  currently  being  subjected  to  an  assessment  conducted  by  the  IMF  and  World 
Bank under the Financial Sector Assessment Programme, or FSAP. 
Second, as part of its efforts to improve access to finance, South Africa is moving towards a 
co-operative  banking  regulatory  framework  in  order  to  advance  the  social  and  economic 
welfare of South Africans. Significant progress has been made to date, including the recent 
promulgation  of  the  Co-operative  Banks  Act,  No.  40  of  2007.  The  applicable  supervisory 
bodies  are  in  the  process  of  establishing  the  required  developmental  and  supervisory 
structures.  The  Act  and  the  Regulations  are  likely  to  be  implemented  concurrently  during 
2008. 
Third, the Competition Commission of South Africa has recently completed an Enquiry into 
Competition in Banking: at present, only the Executive Overview has been released and is 
currently being studied.

 BIS Review 91/2008
Finally, in this regard, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) released its Annual Report 
last week, noting in particular the rapid deterioration in the stability of financial markets during 
the past year. Most notable, in the view of the BIS, was the “onset of turmoil in the US market 
for sub-prime mortgages which rapidly affected many other financial markets ….” 
In  the  case  of  South  Africa,  however,  the  effects  of  this  turmoil  in  international  financial 
markets, so far, have been indirect. They have been felt primarily in the form of volatility in 
the domestic financial markets and in the form of increased pricing for off-shore funding. 
In  theory,  international  contagion  could  also  be  transmitted  through  the  international 
exposures  of  the  South  African  financial  system.  In  the  event,  however,  this  has  not 
materialised  as  the  financial  sector  had  very  little  direct  exposure  to  the  US  sub-prime 
market.  Moreover,  as  has  been  indicated  earlier,  the  banking  sector  in  South  Africa  has 
capital  in  excess  of  the  regulatory  requirement,  operates  within  a  regulatory  environment 
which  is  fully  compliant  with  the  Basel  II  regulatory  framework:  and  is  subject  to  robust 
supervision by the Registrar.  
Regional economic arrangements 
3. 
As is well known, South Africa is a member of three regional organisations in the Southern 
Africa region, these being the Common Monetary Area (CMA) (with Lesotho, Namibia and 
Swaziland);  the  Southern  African  Customs  Union  (SACU),  with  Botswana  and  the  CMA 
countries;  and  the  Southern  Africa  Development  Community,  SADC,  whose  members 
include all SACU members as well as Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, 
Malawi, Mauritius, Mocambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. 
The  CMA,  at  present, allows  each  member  to  have  its  own  currency,  these  being  pegged 
one-to-one to the South African Rand which circulates as legal tender throughout the Area. 
Each member state, except South Africa, is required to maintain foreign reserves equivalent 
in value to the total amount of local currency issued. The reciprocal obligation of South Africa 
is then to pay seignorage to the other countries in proportion to the Rand circulating within 
their  respective  regions.  For  consistency,  moreover,  exchange  controls  are  harmonised 
throughout the region. 
Most of the major South African banks have a presence in each of the member countries of 
the CMA as indicated in table 3: but, as of now, none of the home-grown banks in Lesotho, 
Namibia, and Swaziland have yet established a presence in South Africa. 
Regarding  SACU,  it  is  the  case  that  negotiations  leading  to  the  current  arrangement  and 
reserve-sharing  formula  were  finalised  in  2002;  ratified  in  a  formal  treaty  in  2004  and  the 
provisions  were  first  implemented  in  2005.  Revenue,  deriving  in  essence  from  the 
implementation  of  a  common  external  import  tariff  structure  for  the  Union  and  from  excise 
taxes collected, is apportioned among the member states in accordance with a formula which 
has  three  components:  namely,  a  customs  component,  an  excise  component  and  a 
development component. During the three years of operation, South Africa’s contribution to 
the SACU revenue pool has amounted to approximately 98 per cent whilst South Africa has, 
in effect, retained the bulk of the excise component – which typically amounts to about 50 per 
cent of the total; the balance has then been transferred to the other SACU member states, 
constituting  a  charge  on  the  services  account  of  South  Africa’s  balance  of  payments;  an 
income  in  the  services  account  of  the  balance  of  payments  accounts  of  the  other  SACU 
member states. With imports rising rapidly in recent years, import duties collected have also 
been buoyant and the total amount paid over to the governments of Lesotho, Namibia and 
Swaziland has risen threefold over the past five years. 
Within  SADC,  recent  developments  have  been  guided  by  the  Memorandum  of  Agreement 
(MOU) on macro-economic convergence, signed in August 2002 on the one hand; and the 
Regional Indicative Strategy Development Plan (RISDP), on the other. 
BIS Review 91/2008

The  MOU  identifies  the  following  indicators  as  convergence  criteria  and  proposes  the 
timetable indicated in Table 4 for their achievement, whilst Table 5 adumbrates the timetable 
for  achievement  of  the  quantitative  targets  for  the  so-called  secondary  macro-economic 
indicators. 
Stated  in  words,  the  SADC  convergence  criteria  require  member  states  to  achieve  the 
following  by  2018:  an  inflation  rate  of  less  than  3  per  cent  per  annum;  a  budget-deficit-to-
GDP ratio of less than 3 per cent; a ratio of public-sector debt to GDP of less than 60 per 
cent and a ratio of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments to GDP of 
less than 5 per cent. Table 5 can be interpreted in similar fashion, mutatis mutandis. 
The  desire  for  a  stable  macro-economic  environment  is  one  to  which  most  policy-makers 
would assent. Clearly, though, there will be a need to re-assess the quantitative dimensions 
of the desired end-state if severe macro-economic dislocation is to be avoided in the period 
which is to extend beyond 2012, in terms of the SADC timetable. 
South Africa has a well regulated banking system, well capitalised, compliant with 
Basel II and largely unaffected by contagion arising from the financial market turmoil 
which started in the sub-prime market of the United States of America last year. 
The  relevant  South  African  authorities  maintain  vigilance  with  regard  to  further 
development of the banking and financial system. Evidence of this is to be found in 
recent  regulatory  pronouncements,  in  particular  changes  to  the  regulations  under 
the Banks Act and legislation intended to extend access to finance, or as Dr Bruwer 
would have it, to “enter the remotest hamlet in the country …” 
South Africa, today, does not have a hopeless inferiority complex with regard to the 
capacity to run her own banking and currency system. 
Regional  integration  is  an  objective  of  the  governments  of  the  Southern  African 
region  and  should  provide  further  impetus  for  enhanced  economic  growth  and  an 
environment  in  which  existing  and  new  banks,  adhering  to  the  dictates  of  probity, 
can thrive through competition at arms-length contributing to and being guided by 
market  forces.  The  current  uni-directional  flow  of  investments  by  banks  surely 
presents a welcome challenge to those entrepreneurs of lofty ambition. 
In  the  absence  of  uniform  conditions,  monetary  authorities  in  their  respective 
jurisdictions will have to improvise, adapting their practices to local conditions. They 
must  expect  to  be  criticised,  sometimes  vilified  for  doing  their  work,  particularly 
during times of economic adjustment.  
There is no short cut to development or to sustainable regional integration. These 
take  time,  consistent  application  and  nimble  adaptation.  So  too  with  banking  in 
Africa.
