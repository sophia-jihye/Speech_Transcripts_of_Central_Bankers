Philipp Hildebrand: Lessons from the financial market turbulence 
Summary of a speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of 
the Swiss National Bank, at the Jefferies prize-giving ceremony, Zurich, 27 August 2008. 
The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). 
 The  current  financial  crisis  is  probably  the  most  complex  since  the  1930s.  The  extent  of 
international cooperation in overcoming it is greater than ever before. An important part in 
these activities is being played by the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), which was founded in 
1998 and to which Switzerland has belonged since 2007. Six months after the start of the 
crisis,  in  April  2008,  the  FSF  published  a  series  of  recommendations  for  enhancing  the 
resilience of the international financial system. 
There are three main advantages to cooperating internationally in this way. First, it is easier 
to focus more clearly on identifying solutions. Second, it ensures that particular attention is 
paid  to  maintaining  a  level  playing  field  when  establishing  regulatory  measures.  Third,  it 
creates  considerable  pressure  for  any  recommendations  issued  to  be  implemented  in 
practice.  
The  current  crisis  has  shown  that  the  Swiss  banking  system  remains  vulnerable  to  major 
shocks. As part of its statutory mandate to contribute to financial stability, the SNB has been 
monitoring developments since the start of the crisis very carefully. The lessons learned by 
the SNB from the crisis tie in with the recommendations of the FSF. For the SNB, the focus is 
on  measures  that  reinforce  the  long-term  resilience  of  our  financial  system  with  a  view  to 
future financial market crises.
