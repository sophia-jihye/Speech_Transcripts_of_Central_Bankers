Durmuş Yılmaz: Turkey’s monetary and exchange rate policy for 2009  
Speech by Mr Durmuş Yilmaz, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at 
the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, Ankara, 16 December 2008. 
General framework of the monetary policy 
 Overview  
Assessing the monetary policy decisions of CBT in relation to the developments in the last 
three years, it is of importance  to fully comprehend the strategy to be implemented in the 
upcoming period. Therefore, before covering the operational framework of the monetary and 
exchange  rate  policy  for  2009,  it  is  better  to  provide  a  general  evaluation  of  the  inflation-
targeting regime, which has been implemented for the last seven years since 2001. 
Between  2002-2005,  the  Central  Bank  implemented  an  implicit  inflation-targeting  regime 
under  which  short-term  interest  rates  were  used  as  the  main  policy  tool.  Following  the 
achievements  in  the  fight  against  inflation,  decision-making  processes  gradually  became 
more transparent and foreseeable, thus, finally in 2006, the transition to an explicit inflation-
targeting  regime  was  announced.  The  adoption  of  the  explicit  inflation-targeting  regime 
coincided  with  a  period  when  the  global  conjuncture  was  undergoing  rapid  changes,  as  a 
consequence of which; the Turkish economy faced a series of shocks. As a matter of fact, 
when  we  look  at  the  2006-2008  period,  it  is  evident  that  factors  hindering  the  decline  in 
inflation mostly stem from the developments beyond the domain of monetary policy. These 
shocks, of which some have prolonged impacts, caused inflation to exceed the targets during 
this period (Chart 1).

The first serious shock to the inflation-targeting regime in Turkey arose upon a time when 
international  capital  conditions  changed  to  the  disadvantage  of  developing  countries  and 
capital  outflow  was  experienced  in  many  countries  including  Turkey,  from  May  2006 
onwards. In this period, depreciation of the New Turkish Lira (TRY) around 30 percent and 
the lack of confidence created by financial turbulence combined with sharp increases in food 
prices  due  to  drought  led  inflation  rates  increase  and  inflation  expectations  exceed  the 
targets considerably. In order to avoid any permanent effect on pricing behaviors, the Central 
Bank tightened monetary policy significantly and took a series of additional policy measures. 
These  measures  varied  from  suspending  foreign  exchange  buying  auctions  to  several 
arrangements regarding TRY and foreign exchange liquidity. Even though the gap between 
inflation  expectations  and  inflation  targets  widened  following  fluctuations,  inflation  and 
inflation expectations were to a great extent brought under control, owing to the measures 
taken.  
In the period covering 2007 and onwards, the main factors impeding the disinflation process 
were  sharp  increases  in  oil  and  other  commodity  prices  in  the  international  markets  along 
with adjustments in administered/directed prices. The significant weight of food prices within 
the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Turkey – as is the case in many developing countries –
increased the volatility of inflation. 
In 2007 and onwards, rapidly increasing food and energy prices in the international markets 
caused  inflation  to  display  an  upward  trend  on  a  global  scale.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  by 
November 2008, inflation rates in all developing countries – apart from Brazil – implementing 
inflation-targeting regimes exceeded inflation targets by a significant margin (Chart 2). This 
observation confirms the fact that the relatively high inflation figures of 2007 and 2008 in our 
country should be assessed mostly as a reflection of global factors.

As  inflation  remained  significantly  above  targets  for  a  protracted  period,  it  entailed  the 
Central Bank to pursue an efficient communication strategy. In this context since 2007, when 
2 
 BIS Review 3/2009
supply  shocks  became  more  apparent,  the  Central  Bank  has  highlighted  core  inflation 
indicators  excluding  energy  and  food  prices  and  has  frequently  referred  to  them.  It  was 
emphasized in this period that, despite the upward trend of inflation, there was no pressure 
on core inflation indicators and that prices, which were not directly affected by supply shocks, 
did not display high increases. Under the assumption that the hike in energy and food prices 
is temporary, and thus inflation shall resume its downward trend, the aim was to direct the 
focus  of  economic  agents  to  the  medium-term  in  order  to  avoid  undesired  fluctuations  in 
economic activity. At first, this approach was successful in containing inflation expectations. 
However, the fact that shocks were more persistent than expected caused the rise in food 
and  energy  prices  to  influence  prices  in  general  and  an  increase  was  observed  in  core 
inflation  indicators.  In  early  2008,  when  turbulence  in  the  global  markets  that  started  in 
summer  2007  was  combined  with  domestic  political  uncertainties,  significant  depreciation 
was  observed  in  the  Turkish  Lira  and  it  became  considerably  difficult  to  push  inflation 
expectations down to levels consistent with the previously set inflation target of 4 percent. 
Although  not  attaining  inflation  targets  stems  from  factors  beyond  the  domain  of  monetary 
policy, overshooting of inflation target for two consecutive years and also the expectation of 
overshooting  2008  target  have  undermined  the  role  of  inflation  targets  as  an  anchor  for 
inflation expectations. In fact, studies within our Bank indicate that gradually more weight is 
attached to past inflation in forming expectations and as of mid-2006 inflation expectations 
have become more susceptible to variables like exchange rate and risk premium. According 
to  the  Central  Bank,  if  this  situation  becomes  permanent,  the  cost  of  fighting  inflation  will 
increase.  Therefore,  in  an  open  letter  to  the  Government  in  June  2008  the  Central  Bank 
proposed setting new targets for the medium term in order to control inflation expectations 
and to re-establish the reputation of the implemented regime. The Government accepted this 
proposal and the inflation targets for 2009 to 2011 were revised as 7.5, 6.5, and 5.5 percent, 
respectively. Hence, the inflation targets to be used as a reference by economic agents to 
form their expectations were set with the objective of containing inflation expectations and 
reducing the cost of the fight against inflation. 
Bearing in mind that altering inflation targets might lead to the deterioration in the inflation 
expectations in the short run, the Central Bank implemented the target revision along with 
monetary  tightening.  Thereby,  the  negative  impact  that  might  be  created  by  the  upward 
revision  of  targets  has  been  contained.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  during  the  period  of  target 
revision,  a  slight  deterioration  was  observed  in  the  medium-term  inflation  expectations  but 
with  diminishing  political  uncertainties  and  monetary  tightening,  inflation  expectations  have 
been contained (Chart 3).  
In the last quarter of 2008, the aggravated lack of confidence in the global financial markets 
had  unfavorable  effects  on  the  global  liquidity  flow  and  created  an  extraordinary  demand 
especially for US dollar liquidity. This led to significant depreciation of the TRY, as was the 
case  for  currencies  of  other  developing  countries.  Despite  these  developments  in  the 
exchange  rate,  slowdown  in  total  demand  and  the  decline  in  commodity  and  food  prices 
affected inflation outlook positively, which provided room to maneuver for monetary policy. 
Against this backdrop, the Central Bank has taken several measures to support the liquidity 
of the financial system and to ensure the efficient functioning of the credit markets.

Since the Central Bank can directly control New Turkish Lira liquidity, it can support smooth 
functioning of financial and credit markets by providing the required liquidity. As for foreign 
exchange liquidity developments however, external conditions are more influential. In fact, in 
a period when uncertainties surrounding the global economy are at high levels, the Central 
Bank adopted the strategy to use foreign exchange reserves to primarily support the foreign 
exchange liquidity of our banking system. Within this framework, the Central Bank resumed 
its activities as an intermediary in the Foreign Exchange Deposit Market; lending rates of this 
market  was  reduced  and  maturities  were  extended.  Besides,  during  periods  of  ailing  price 
movements,  foreign  exchange  liquidity  was  injected  via  foreign  exchange  selling  auctions. 
Moreover, it has been declared to the public that if deemed necessary, additional measures 
might be taken to ensure that the financial markets function efficiently. 
All  these  measures  have  helped  contain  the  effects  of  the  global  financial  turmoil  on  the 
domestic  economy.  The  Central  Bank  will  continue  to  take  the  necessary  measures, 
provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective.  
In the last quarter of 2008, global financial conditions have been tighter than required by the 
stance  of  monetary  policy,  owing  mainly  to  the  intensification  of  the  global  financial  crisis. 
Turkey has also been undergoing a similar process. In this context, the Central Bank recently 
made a  measured cut in short-term interest rates, in order to offset the extra tightening in 
monetary conditions. 
In order to  be able to comprehend  the monetary policy decisions of the Central Bank, the 
nature of the shocks to the economy should be analyzed properly at the outset. For instance, 
while an unexpected and strong monetary tightening was implemented in the face of capital 
outflows  in  the  May-June  2006  period,  an  expansionary  monetary  policy  was  adopted 
following  capital  outflows  in  the  last  quarter  of  2008  (Chart  4).  The  contradiction  between 
these two responses can be explained mainly by the significant differences between the said 
two periods in terms of both economic conjuncture and the sources of the shocks. As both 
domestic demand and external demand were strong in 2006, the exchange rate movements 
triggered  by  capital  outflows  had  the  potential  to  rapidly  damage  disinflation  and  inflation 
expectations.  However,  in  2008,  it  is  observed  that  the  downward  pressure  of  the  global 
recession and weak domestic demand conditions on the inflation has come to the forefront.

In  sum,  it  is  seen  that  the  inflation-targeting  regime  has  provided  a  significant  amount  of 
flexibility to take the necessary measures in the face of high-level shocks. When the course 
of medium-term inflation expectations is analyzed, it is observed that the expected inflation 
continues  to  remain  well  below  the  actual  inflation  figures  although  inflation  had  clearly 
remained  above  the  target  level  for  quite some  time.  When  considering  the  period  of  high 
inflation  levels  experienced  by  Turkey  in  recent  years,  one  of  the  most  significant 
achievements  of 
in  managing 
expectations in a time of extraordinary shocks. 
inflation-targeting  regime  has  been 
its  success 
the 
Operational framework for monetary policy  
Inflation targets 
Inflation targets have been set jointly with the Government as “point target” since 2006, over 
the  end-year  inflation  rates  calculated  by  the  annual  percentage  change  of  the  Consumer 
Price  Index  (CPI)  for  a  target  horizon  of  three  years.  As  mentioned  above,  targets  for  the 
next  three-year  period  were  announced  during  the  revision  in  June  2008.  Within  this 
framework,  inflation  targets  for 2009,  2010  and 2011  are  7.5  percent,  6.5  percent  and  5.5 
percent, respectively. 
Accountability 
In the first three-year period of the inflation-targeting regime, the Central Bank explained the 
reasons for deviations from inflation targets and policy measures taken with open letters sent 
to the Government, and hence meticulously applied the principle of accountability. Gradually, 
Inflation Reports also became a significant support to the accountability mechanism. 
It is stipulated in Article 42 of the CBT Law that “The Bank shall submit information to the 
Government in writing and inform the public disclosing the reasons of incapability to achieve 
the  determined  targets  in  due  time  published  or  the  occurrence  of  the  possibility  of  not 
achieving  and  the  measures  to  be  taken  thereof”.  Implementation  details  regarding  the 
specification of the extent of the deviation from the target that require explanation are left to 
BIS Review 3/2009

the discretion of the Central Bank. In this respect, the Central Bank sets an uncertainty band 
around  the  target  and  enforces  the  accountability  mechanism  in  case  figures  breach  this 
band. 
The  uncertainty  band  for  2009  has  been  maintained  at  two  percentage  points  around  the 
target. In this context, a path consistent with the end-year target has been established for the 
end of each quarter. The figures to be used as a reference for accountability throughout 2009 
can be found in Table 1.

In  case  end-of-quarter  inflation  figures  breach  the  band  specified  in  Table  1,  the  Central 
Bank will disclose the reasons for the deviation in the quarterly Inflation Report, together with 
the measures already taken as well as those to be taken to attain convergence to the target. 
Thus,  the  Inflation  Report  will  also  have  an  important  role  as  the  main  tool  of  the 
accountability mechanism. In case the end-year inflation deviates more than two percentage 
points in either direction, the Central Bank will draft a detailed letter to the Government and 
share this letter with the public.  
At this point, it should be emphasized once more that the Central Bank does not have any 
targets for quarterly basis and the official target announced is the end-year inflation target. 
Therefore, it should be underlined that the end-of-quarter figures specified above have been 
set  only  to  facilitate  the  accountability  mechanism  and  should  not  be  perceived  as  interim 
targets.  
Inflation forecasts and monetary policy stance  
With the adoption of the inflation-targeting regime, medium-term inflation forecasts started to 
be included in Inflation Reports issued since 2006. In addition to these forecasts, reports also 
provide information regarding the envisaged course of monetary policy. Since 2007, inflation 
forecasts, which extended to eighteen-month periods at the outset, started to cover a two-
year time-span.  
In the face of the extraordinary supply-side shocks experienced since the last quarter of 2007 
and  with  a  view  to  improving  the  predictability  of  monetary  policy,  since  April  2008,  the 
Central  Bank  has  added  projections  to  the  baseline  scenario  under  alternative  scenarios 
based on the food and energy prices. Moreover, the forecast horizon has been extended to 
three years for economic agents to have a clearer vision of the future and develop a longer-
term perspective. 
The main objective of sharing inflation forecasts and the likely policy stance with the public is 
to promote main principles of inflation targeting; i.e. transparency and foreseeability. Such an 
approach  has  helped  strengthen  the  monetary  transmission  mechanism  via  expectations 
channel in recent years. However, the Central Bank preferred to avoid providing hints on the 
course of short-term interest rates in the recent period, as monetary policy now needs to be 
6 
 BIS Review 3/2009
relatively  more  flexible  given  the  current  conjuncture  with  exceptional  uncertainties  in  the 
global  economy.  It  should  be  underlined  that  this  is  a  temporary  situation  and  the 
predictability of monetary policy will increase in the upcoming period when the stability in the 
global economy is restored  
Decision-making process and the communication policy  
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will continue to meet once a month in 2009 as well, 
in accordance with the schedule announced beforehand. Monetary policy decisions at these 
meetings  and  their  rationale  will  be  made  public  on  the  website  of  the  Central  Bank  in  a 
press release posted at 7:00 p.m. on the same day. As in the previous year, the summary of 
the MPC Meeting will be released on the website of the Central Bank within eight working 
days, along with its English translation.  
As  in  previous  years,  the  Inflation  Report,  which  is  the  main  communication  tool  of  the 
monetary  policy,  will  be  published  quarterly  and  introduced  to  the  public  at  a  press 
conference.  The  biannual  presentations  made  by  the  Governor  before  the  Council  of 
Ministers  and  the  Planning  and  Budget  Commission  of  the  Grand  National  Assembly  of 
Turkey – to provide information about the activities and monetary policy implementations of 
the  Bank  –;  monthly  “Price  Developments”  reports  issued  on  the  next  working  day  of  the 
release of the inflation figures; “Financial Stability Report” issued biannually; press releases; 
and presentations and speeches made by the Central Bank authorities in Turkey and abroad 
will  play  important  role  in  informing  the  public.1  Working  papers,  booklets,  technical  notes 
published  and  conferences  and  workshops  arranged  by  the  Bank  will  also  continue  to  be 
used as effective tools of the communication policy.  
Exchange rate policy and liquidity management 
Exchange rate policy 
Along  with  inflation  targeting,  the  Central  Bank  will  continue  to  implement  the  floating 
exchange rate regime in 2009. As stated in the annual monetary and exchange rate policy 
announcements, which have been published since 2002, the foreign exchange rate is not a 
policy  tool  or  target  under  this  regime  and  it  is  determined  by  the  supply  and  demand 
conditions in the market. Whereas the main factors affecting foreign exchange supply and 
demand  are  the  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  implemented,  international  developments, 
economic fundamentals and expectations.  
Although there is no exchange rate level to be maintained in a floating exchange rate regime, 
a  strong  foreign  exchange  reserve  position  is  very  important  for  emerging  economies  like 
Turkey to eliminate the unfavorable effects of potential internal and external shocks and to 
boost  the  confidence  in  the  country.  Therefore,  the  Central  Bank  holds  foreign  exchange 
buying  auctions  to  build  up  reserves  at  times  where  foreign  exchange  supply  increases 
relative to the foreign exchange demand.  
As  meticulous  in  minimizing  the  impact  on  supply  and  demand  conditions  in  the  foreign 
exchange  market,  the  Central  Bank  has  been  buying  foreign  exchange  via  transparent 
foreign  exchange  buying  auctions  with  pre-announced  terms  and  conditions.  Although  the 
aim  is  to  run  auctions  according  to  the  pre-announced  program,  in  case  of  unexpected 
significant  developments  pertaining  to  the  foreign  exchange  supply,  amendments  to  the 
auction programs can be made with prior notice.

Accordingly;

(iii) 
The maximum amount to be purchased in daily foreign exchange buying auctions 
was set as USD 90 million for 2008, with USD 30 million for the auction amount and 
USD 60 million for the optional selling amount.  
However,  as  a  result  of  the  increased  exchange  rate  volatility  in  our  foreign 
exchange market parallel to the increased expectations of a possible stagnation in 
developed economies, the maximum daily amount to be purchased was reduced to 
USD 45 million, with USD 15 million for the auction amount and USD 30 million for 
the optional selling amount, as of 10 March 2008.  
Meanwhile,  the  Central  Bank  has  implemented  a  set  of  measures  since  October, 
with the aim of abating potential problems in the Turkish financial markets that may 
arise  from  global  developments.  Within  this  scope,  foreign  exchange  buying 
auctions were suspended as of 16 October 2008 in order to keep the liquidity, which 
is  permanently  withdrawn  from  the  foreign  exchange  market  through  foreign 
exchange buying auctions, in the system, and hence, to further enhance the liquidity 
conditions of the Turkish banks.  
In  addition  to  the  suspension  of  the  foreign  exchange  buying  auctions,  the  Central  Bank 
started to inject foreign exchange liquidity into the market through foreign exchange selling 
auctions  as  of  24  October  2008  as  unhealthy  price  formations  were  witnessed  due  to  a 
decrease  in  the  depth  of  the  foreign  exchange  market.  The  daily  amount  of  the  foreign 
exchange to be sold via auctions was set as USD 50 million, which could be raised on the 
days  of  the  auction  when  deemed  necessary.  It  was  also  announced  to  the  public  that 
depending on developments in the foreign exchange market, the daily auction amounts might 
be  changed  and  the  auctions  might  also  be  suspended,  when  deemed  necessary.  As  a 
matter of fact, after the auctions held on two working days, the Central Bank suspended the 
foreign  exchange  selling  auctions  on  30  October  2008  as  a  result  of  easing  concerns 
pertaining  to  the  depth  of  the  foreign  exchange  market,  which  was  also  facilitated  by 
favorable developments in the global markets.  
Hence, in 2008, while the total amount of foreign exchange purchased via buying auctions 
reached USD 7.584 million, USD 100 million was sold through two foreign exchange selling 
auctions.  There  has  not  been  any  direct  intervention  in  the  foreign  exchange  market.  The 
total  amounts  of  foreign  exchange  purchased  and  sold  by  the  Central  Bank  from  2002 
onwards are shown on a yearly basis in the table given below:

As of 15 December 2008 
 
Problems  in  the  international  credit  markets  have  heightened  since  the  second  half  of 
September  due  to  increased  concerns  over  the  credibility  of  the  financial  system,  thus 
leading to liquidity problems in many countries. During this period, the Central Bank adopted 
the following regulations in order to ensure the efficient functioning of the foreign exchange 
market and to strengthen foreign exchange liquidity in the banking system in case of liquidity 
problems: 
(i) 
On  9  October  2008,  the  Central  Bank  resumed  its  intermediary  activities  in  the 
foreign exchange deposit markets in Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets with 
a view to contributing to the enhancement of the mobilization of foreign exchange 
liquidity in the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market.  
Transaction  limits  for  the  banks  in  the  Foreign  Exchange  and  Banknotes  Markets 
were  revised  on  14  October  2008  and  limits  were  doubled  for  each  bank  on  24 
October 2008 to reach a total of USD 10.8 billion.  
On  21  November  2008, 
the  FX  deposit  borrowed  within 
predetermined  borrowing  limits  by  the  Banks  from  the  Foreign  Exchange  Deposit 
Markets in terms of USD and Euro was extended from one week to one month and 
the lending rate that had been previously set as 10 percent in the said market was 
reduced to 7 percent for USD and 9 percent for Euro.  
On 5 December 2008, the FX required reserves ratio dropped from 11 percent to 9 
percent,  providing  the  banking  system  with  an  additional  foreign  currency  liquidity 
amounting to USD 2.5 billion.   
the  maturity  of 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
In  such  a  challenging  environment,  efficient  utilization  of  foreign  exchange  reserves  by 
developing countries assumes the utmost importance. Taking into consideration of this, the 
Central  Bank,  when  deemed  necessary,  will  always  continue  to  take  additional  measures 
within its means prudently in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the FX market and to 
support  FX  liquidity.  In  this  framework,  in  the  event  of  further  intensifying  of  the  financial 
turmoil in global markets that might have negative impacts on the Turkish economy;  
(i) 
Under  the  basic  principles  of  the  floating  exchange  rate  regime,  if  unhealthy 
fluctuations are witnessed in the foreign exchange market due to a decrease in the 
depth of the market foreign exchange selling auctions will be held  
BIS Review 3/2009 
 9
(ii) 
Transaction limits for banks in the Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets will be 
raised,  
The FX required reserve ratio might be further reduced to a limited extent.  
(iii) 
The Central Bank will continue to closely monitor exchange rate developments in 2009 and 
will  directly  intervene  in  the  market  in  case  of  any  unhealthy  fluctuations  in  the  exchange 
rates due to speculative behavior stemming from a decrease in the market depth.  
Moreover,  the  purchase/sale  transactions  of  “foreign  exchange  against  foreign  exchange,” 
“foreign  exchange  against  foreign  banknotes”  and  “foreign  banknotes  against  foreign 
banknotes” conducted between the Central Bank and institutions authorized to operate in the 
Foreign Exchange and Banknotes Markets will continue in 2009.  
In  case  of  a  recovery  in  the  liquidity  conditions  due  to  developments  in  the  international 
markets;  
(i) 
The Central Bank may, with prior notice, resume foreign exchange buying 
auctions in line with the general strategy of strengthening foreign exchange 
reserves at times when foreign exchange supply increases compared to the 
foreign exchange demand. 
The  Central  Bank  might  cease  to  perform  its  intermediary  function  in  the 
Foreign Exchange Deposit Market. However, even in such a case, banks 
will  still  be  able  to  borrow  foreign  exchange  deposits  from  the  Foreign 
Exchange Deposit Markets within the predetermined borrowing limits.  
The FX required reserves ratio might be increased.  
(ii) 
(iii) 
In  view  of  the  fact  that  financial  stability  is  one  of  the  prerequisites  for  price  stability,  the 
Central  Bank  took  the  necessary  measures  in  order  to  ensure  the  efficient  operation  of 
Turkey’s  foreign  exchange  market  without  facing  any  liquidity  problems.  The  Central  Bank 
also announced possible additional measures. Nevertheless, bearing in mind that under the 
current exchange rate regime economic agents operate in an environment of exchange rate 
risk, they should establish mechanisms that will ensure efficient risk management.  
Liquidity management 
While drawing up the general framework of liquidity management, the Central Bank took into 
consideration following objectives; 
(i) ensuring that short-term interest rates would remain at or revolve around the level set by 
the  Committee,  (ii)  ensuring  the  efficient  and  stable  operation  of  money  markets  by 
preventing  excessive  volatilities  in  short-term  interest  rates  of  the  money  market,  (iii) 
ensuring smooth functioning of the payments system. (iv) providing the operational structure 
with sufficient flexibility against unexpected developments in the markets. 
Another  important  factor  that  determines  the  general  framework  of  the  Central  Bank’s 
liquidity management is the level of liquidity in the market.  
The main factors that directly affect the liquidity in the market are as follows: 
(i)  Changes  in  monetary  base,  (ii)  The  Central  Bank’s  foreign  currency  purchase/sales 
transactions, (iii) Interests paid/collected by the Central Bank for open market operations and 
interests paid by the Central Bank for TRY reserve requirements, (iv) The Treasury’s primary 
surplus,  (v)  The  spread  between  the  Treasury’s  redemption  and  issue  of  net  TRY 
government  bonds,  excluding  the  Central  Bank,  (vi)  Privatization  and  SDIF-related  TRY 
transfers to the Treasury.  
In  addition,  as  Treasury  determines  the  TRY-denominated  borrowing  requirement,  the 
Treasury’s  net  FX-denominated  collections  or  payments  including  domestic  and  external 
10 
 BIS Review 3/2009
borrowing,  the  Treasury’s  redemption  to  the  CBRT  and  CBRT  profit  transfers  can  all 
indirectly affect TRY liquidity in the market.  
Excess liquidity conditions, which were created by government bonds bought by the Central 
Bank in 2001 from public banks and banks within the SDIF, and later by large amounts of FX 
purchase, prevailed in the market until May 2008. The liquidity shortage that emerged in the 
market in May 2008 continued for the rest of the year. The Central Bank withdrew the excess 
liquidity  in  the  market  mainly  via  New  Turkish  Lira  deposit  transactions  in  the  Interbank 
Money  Market  within  the  CBRT  and  reverse  repo  transactions  in  the  Repo  and  Reverse 
Repo Market of the Istanbul Stock Exchange, on an overnight basis. Following the liquidity 
shortage  of  May  2008,  the  Central  Bank  started  to  meet  liquidity  requirements  via  regular 
one-week repo auctions. Meanwhile, due to the fact that some banks preferred to lend their 
excess liquidity to the Central Bank in the Interbank Money Market owing to factors such as 
transaction costs and tax differences as long as interest rates in the secondary market did 
not significantly exceed the Central Bank borrowing rate, the Central Bank injected liquidity to 
the market via one-week auctions on the one hand, and made overnight borrowings on the 
other  hand.  Hence,  the  Central  Bank  prevented  overnight  interest  rates  to  significantly 
surpass the Central Bank’s overnight borrowing rate, a reference rate for  monetary policy, 
thus ensuring the efficient distribution of liquidity in the banking system. Thus, the borrowing 
rate of the Central Bank has continued to be the benchmark interest rate for markets.  
At end-2007, the Central Bank withdrew total liquidity of TRY 3.9 billion including TRY 2.9 
billion  at  overnight  maturity  and  TRY  1.0  billion  via  liquidity  bills.  At  the  end  of  November 
2008, the Central Bank injected TRY 19 billion worth of liquidity to the market via one-week 
repo auctions and withdrew TRY 8.6 billion at overnight maturity. Hence, the excess liquidity, 
which was TRY 3.9 billion at end-2007, turned into a liquidity shortage of TRY 10.4 billion at 
the end of November 2008. As a result, liquidity in the market dropped by TRY 14.3 billion 
(Table 3).

Accordingly,  while  the  Central  Bank’s  foreign  exchange  purchases  and  interest  payments 
boosted liquidity by TRY 11 billion in 2008, the Treasury’s operations amounting to TRY 14.8 
billion and the TRY 10.5 billion increase in monetary base eroded liquidity by a total of TRY 
25.3 billion.  
Significant uncertainties  exist  regarding  liquidity  conditions  in  2009.  The  reason  is  that  the 
Central  Bank’s  foreign  currency  purchase/sale  operations  against  TRY  and  the  Treasury’s 
net foreign exchange collections or payments are not yet clear, and the realizations can also 
be different from the envisaged within the year. Under the assumptions that the Central Bank 
will  not  conduct  foreign  currency  purchase/sale  operations  against  TRY  and  that  the 
Treasury  will  act  as  net  foreign  currency  payer  at  a  reasonable  level,  it  is  predicted  that 
though  the  liquidity  shortage  in  the  market  will  be  at  moderate  levels  throughout  the  first 
quarter, it will be gradually permanent from the second quarter onwards. If the Central Bank 
sells  foreign  exchange  against  TRY,  a  permanent  liquidity  shortage  might  emerge  earlier 
than  expected.  On  the  other  hand,  in  case  the  re-commencement  of  FX  buying  by  the 
Central  Bank  due  to  improved  conditions  in  international  markets  or  the  utilization  net  FX 
inflows  of  the  Treasury  in  terms  of  TRY  might  hinder  occurrence  of  permanent  liquidity 
shortage.  
Rise in the liquidity shortage causes the interest rates of repo auctions to become reference 
rates for the markets. The permanency of such conditions leads to an involuntary tightening 
of  monetary  policy  because  of  the  realization  of  the  said  interest  rates  above  the  Central 
Bank’s  overnight  borrowing  rates.  In  order  to  avoid  potential  negative  impacts  of  such  a 
situation,  interest  rates  of  one-week  repo  auctions  will  be  set  as  the  reference  rate  for 
monetary  policy  operations,  in  the  event  of  an  increase  in  liquidity  shortage  and/or  having 
high probability to become permanent. Furthermore, the Central Bank’s overnight borrowing 
and lending rates will be revised downward with a view to eliminating any probable impact of 
this change in the operational structure on the monetary policy stance. In other words, this 
interest  rate  cut  should  not  be  perceived  as  loosening  monetary  policy,  but  merely  as  a 
technical adjustment resulting from the permanent change in liquidity conditions.  
12 
 BIS Review 3/2009
Operational framework for liquidity management  
If  the  technical  interest  cut  mentioned  above  does  not  materialize,  the  2009  liquidity 
management strategy will be as follows:  
(i) 
The Central Bank will continue to announce overnight borrowing and lending rates 
between 10:00 a.m.– 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. – 4:00 p.m. in the Interbank Money 
Market within the Central Bank. In case of a liquidity shortage during the day, banks 
will be able to borrow at the Central Bank’s lending rate against collateral within their 
limits. In the event of excess liquidity, banks will be able to lend New Turkish Lira to 
the Central Bank at the Central Bank’s borrowing rate without any limit.  
The  current  implementation  of  the  Late  Liquidity  Window  Facility  will  continue. 
Banks will borrow from the Central Bank against collateral, and lend to the Central 
Bank without any limit between 4:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m. and on the last working day of 
the required reserve provision between 4:00 p.m. – 5:15 p.m.  
In  case  of  a  temporary  or  permanent  liquidity  shortage,  the  Central  Bank  will 
continue  to  execute  its  liquidity  management  mainly  through  one-week  repo 
auctions.  During  the  periods  when  the  Central  Bank  does  not  apply  a  technical 
interest rate cut, the Central Bank will announce the amount of repo auction for the 
day  of  liquidity  shortage  on  Reuters’  “CBTF”  page  at  10:00  a.m.  As  long  as  no 
extraordinary  fluctuations  are  observed  in  the  markets,  the  Central  Bank,  while 
determining  the  amount  of  the  auctions,  will  endeavor  to  maintain  the  average 
auction interest rate as close as possible to the borrowing rate of the Central Bank 
announced for intraday transactions.  
Weekly repo auctions will be held at 11:00 a.m. and the results will be announced 
on  Reuters’  CBTG  page  no  later  than  at  11:30  a.m.  as  much  as  possible.  The 
traditional method will be used in auctions; in other words, successful bidders will be 
evaluated with their own interest rates. 
In case of unforeseen excessive liquidity shortage during the day, which would exert 
excessive pressure on money market interest rates, the CBRT may announce “Intra-
day Repo Auctions” in addition to the regular ones announced at 11:00 a.m. 
The  primary  dealer  banks  will  be  able  to  conduct  repo  transactions  within  the 
framework  of  open  market  operations,  between  10:00  a.m.  –12:00  p.m.  and  1:00 
p.m.–4:00 p.m.

(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Technical interest rate cut and the new operational framework  
In cases where the liquidity shortage in the market increases and/or becomes pronounced to 
be  permanent,  the  Central  Bank  will  rearrange  its  operational  framework  of  liquidity 
management and opt for a technical interest rate cut. Accordingly,  
(i) 
The  Central  Bank  benchmark  interest  rate  will  be  the  interest  rates  of  one-week 
maturity repo auctions to be held regularly, which are the basic funding instrument. . 
The  repo  auction  interest  rate  will  match  the  Central  Bank  borrowing  interest  rate 
applicable to intra-day transactions prior to the period of technical interest cut. For 
instance,  if  a  decision  was  made  to  make  a  technical  interest  rate  cut  on  15 
December 2008, the interest rate on repo auctions would be set as 16.25 percent, 
the rate applicable to intra-day borrowing transactions by the Central Bank.  
With respect to the technical interest rate cut; 
a. 
Overnight Interest Rates: The CBT borrowing and lending interest rates will 
be set 1.25 points below and above the repo interest rate, respectively. For 
instance,  if  the  repo  interest  rate  is  set  as  16.25  percent,  then  the  CBT 
borrowing  rate  will  be  15.00  percent,  while  the  CBT  lending  rate  will  be 
17.50 percent. 
(iv) 
BIS Review 3/2009 
 13
b. 
c. 
Late Liquidity Window (LON) Interest Rates: Within the scope of the Late 
Liquidity  Window,  CBT  overnight  borrowing  and  lending  rates  will  be  4 
points  below  and  above  the  interest  rates  on  repo  auctions,  respectively. 
For instance, if the interest rate on repo auctions is set as 16.25 percent, 
then  the  CBT  LON  borrowing  rate  will  be  12.25  percent,  while  CBT  LON 
lending rate will be 20.25 percent. 
The interest rates on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities 
provided  for  primary  dealer  banks  via  repo  transactions  within  the 
framework  of  open  market  transactions  will  be  0.75  points  above  the 
interest  rates  on  repo  auctions.  For  instance,  if  the  interest  rate  on  repo 
auctions  is  set  as  16.25  percent,  then  the  interest  rate  on  borrowing 
facilities provided for primary dealer banks will be 17 percent.  
The method of one-week maturity repo auctions will be modified. Accordingly; 
a. 
One-week maturity repo auctions will not be held via the traditional method; 
but  the  quantity  auction  method.  In  other  words,  the  interest  rate  on  the 
repo  auction  will  be  set  by  the  Committee.  Additionally,  banks  and 
intermediaries  will  only  quote  quantities  for  the  repo  auctions  with  a  one-
week maturity. For instance, if the Committee decides the interest rate on 
one-week maturity repo auctions is to be 16.25 percent, then it will remain 
as 16.25 percent unless the Committee changes this.  
In the case of liquidity shortage due to unpredicted reasons, thus leading to 
a decision for an intra-day repo auction, such auctions will be held at the 
interest rate set by the Committee via the quantity auction method. 
Each bidder shall make an offer at most for the amount announced for that 
day and the funding amount to be raised via the auction will be distributed 
to participants according to the ratios of their bids to the auction amount..  
Other  guidelines  governing  the  auctions  and  transactions  shall  remain 
unchanged.  
b. 
c. 
d. 
In the case of a temporary liquidity surplus, instead of one-week repo auctions, the 
Central Bank will hold reverse repo auctions with a one-week maturity subject to the 
same conditions and with the interest rate announced for the repo auctions.  
Fixed  rates  will  be  applicable  only  to  repo  and  reverse  repo  auctions  with  a  one-
week  maturity.  Repo  and  reverse  repo  auctions  or  other  auctions  with  maturities 
longer than one-week that the Central Bank may hold within open market operations 
will  continue  to  be  held  under  the  traditional  method  and  the  price/interest  will  be 
formed under market conditions. 
According  to  the  new  operational  structure,  overnight  interest  rates  are  mainly 
expected  to  fluctuate  between  the  Central  Bank  borrowing  interest  rate  and  the 
interest rate of the liquidity facility submitted to primary dealer banks during the day. 
However, under normal conditions while determining the amounts of the auctions for 
repo  and  reverse  repo  auctions  with  a  one-week  maturity,  the  Central  Bank,  will 
endeavor  to  prevent  both  excessive  fluctuation  of  the  ISE  Repo-Reverse  Repo 
Market  overnight  interest  rates,  which  is  an  indicator  of  secondary  money  market 
interest  rates,  and  systematical  formation  of  the  said  rates  significantly  below  or 
above the repo auction interest rates. 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Additionally, with a view to preventing fluctuations in overnight interest rates and enhancing 
the flexibility of the banks’ liquidity management, the Central Bank may consider options like 
narrowing  the  interest  rate  band  of  the  Late  Liquidity  Window  on  the  due  date  of  keeping 
required  reserve  ratios  and  allowing  the  banks  to  keep  a  certain  amount  of  the  required 
14 
 BIS Review 3/2009
reserves  in  the  following  period  or  rendering  the  excess  amounts  to  be  effective  for  the 
following period. 
In cases where the liquidity shortage in the market increases and becomes permanent, the 
funding of the liquidity shortage only by repo auctions with a one-week maturity may have 
adverse effects on longer-term interest rates and the credit mechanism. In order to eliminate 
likely negative outcomes, the Central Bank will hold repo auctions with maturities up to 91 
days  and  purchase  government  securities  to  prevent  funding  being  concentrated  on  one-
week  maturities.  Moreover,  depending  on  the  permanence  of  the  liquidity  shortage,  the 
effectiveness of long-term repo and government securities purchasing transactions, the TRY-
denominated required reserve ratios may be reduced to a limited extent.  
In the case of an excessive increase in the liquidity surplus in the market due to favorable 
international  market  conditions,  in  order  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  and  flexibility  of 
monetary policy and liquidity management strategy, primarily, Central Bank liquidity bills with 
maturities up to 91 days and sales of government securities previously purchased from the 
market will be actively utilized. When deemed necessary, New Turkish Lira deposit buying 
auctions  with  standard  maturities  of  1,  2  and  4  weeks  and  reverse  repo  auctions  with 
maturities up to 91 days will also be used actively. Additionally, TRY-denominated required 
reserve ratios may also be increased. 
Information  on  auctions  of  liquidity  bills  or  government  securities  purchase/sales  will  be 
announced  on  Reuters’  “CBTL”  page  at  10:00  a.m.  one  working  day  prior  to  the  auction. 
These auctions will be held at 11:00 a.m. with the value date of the following working day, 
and  the  results  will  be  announced  no  later  than  at  11:30  a.m.  on  Reuters’  “CBTM”  page. 
Information  on  New  Turkish  Lira  deposit  buying  auctions  will  be  announced  on  Reuters’ 
“CBTY” page; while information on reverse repo auctions will be announced on “CBTF” page 
at 10:00 a.m. on the same day. 
The  Central  Bank’s  current  monetary  policy  instruments  and  the  general  framework  of 
liquidity management are capable of effectively providing the liquidity that may be needed by 
any  bank  or  the  banking  system  as  a  whole  as  long  as  they  have  adequate  collaterals, 
maintaining  price  stability  in  the  money  markets  and  ensuring  that  the  payment  system 
functions  without  interruptions  even  in  extraordinary  conditions.  However,  as  per  the  sub-
paragraph  (c)  of  the  paragraph  (I)  of  Article  40  of  the  CBT  Law,  the  Central  Bank,  as  the 
lender  of  last  resort,  possesses  one  more  lending  instrument  for  emergencies.  The 
mentioned  article  enables  the  Central  Bank  to  extend  credits  to  the  banks  that  are  the 
subject of uncertainty and lack of confidence in the event of acceleration of fund withdrawals 
and uncertainty and lack of confidence in the banking system. Taking into consideration the 
structure  of  the  banking  system  and  the  effectiveness  of  the  available  instruments,  the 
Central Bank does not predict that the use of the mentioned instrument will be needed; but in 
order  to  remain  cautious  of  any  possible  unfavorable  conditions  and  to  clearly  inform  the 
public  of  all  available  facilities,  the  Central  Bank  will  announce  the  credit  utilization 
procedures as soon as possible. 
The  Central  Bank,  with  the  primary  goal  of  achieving  and  maintaining  price  stability,  as 
entrusted  to  it  by  law,  will  continue  its  practices  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  monetary 
policy and liquidity management, also in 2009. Accordingly, the Central Bank may  change 
not only its liquidity management strategy, but also the borrowing and lending interest rate 
margins  in  cases  of  unpredictable  changes  in  market  conditions  and  emergence  of  needs 
that may arise.
