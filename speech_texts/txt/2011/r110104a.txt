José De Gregorio: Exchange rate, macroeconomic policies, and the 
global scenario 
Speech by Mr José De Gregorio, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, before the Senate at 
a special session on the exchange rate, Valparaíso, 14 December 2010. 
 Introduction 
I.  
I am grateful for the Senate’s invitation to analyze exchange rate issues, some of the most 
complex  ones  facing  our  country,  as  well  as  Latin  American  and  most  emerging  market 
economies. We are thus obligated to carefully evaluate the current economic environment, 
its implications on the performance of our economy, and the measures that can be taken if 
deemed  necessary.  In addition,  these  instances  for  analysis  are important  opportunities  to 
communicate in a very transparent fashion the vision of the Central Bank of Chile. 
Along the last few decades, Chile has benefited enormously from being open and globally 
integrated.  This  has  been  one  of  the  cornerstones  of  our  economic  growth.  However,  the 
international economy is at the same time a source of volatility for our economy. The prices 
of  our  exports,  the  economic  activity  of  our  trading  partners,  foreign  interest  rates  and 
international  investors’  appetite  for  risk  fluctuate  substantially.  These  variables  affect  our 
national income, fiscal accounts, external demand for our products, and the availability and 
cost  of  external  financing  and,  indirectly,  expenditure,  output,  the  interest  rate  and  the 
exchange rate in Chile. 
It is impossible to eliminate this volatility without sacrificing the benefits of our international 
openness. However, macroeconomic policies can help the economy to better accommodate 
this changing reality. During the last decade, Chile’s policy mix has succeeded in significantly 
reducing output volatility and external vulnerability. This scenario of stability makes room for 
further economic growth. 
I will begin my presentation by taking a look at the major changes occurred in both the world 
and the domestic economy in the past couple of years and which help explain the behavior of 
our currency. Then I will examine in some detail the role that macroeconomic policies play, 
with  special  emphasis  on  the  monetary  and  exchange  rate  policies  in  this  new  external 
scenario. 
Factors affecting the evolution of the real exchange rate 
II. 
The past six months have seen the peso appreciate around 3% against the euro, and 12% 
against the dollar. The dollar, measured in multilateral terms compared to the main foreign 
currencies, has hit record lows for the past 40 years.  
Today, the real exchange rate index estimated by the Central Bank is 5% below the average 
for the period 1990–2010 (October), and 6.5% below the average for 2000–2010 (figure 1). 
However, and as I will discuss in a moment, current conditions are very different from those 
prevailing over the past two decades. These factors warrant a somewhat more appreciated 
real exchange rate than the average for the past twenty years. Overall, we are aware of the 
volatilities affecting the international markets which can magnify the fluctuations of our real 
exchange rate way beyond its long-term fundamentals.  
Unbalanced recovery of the world economy 
We  observe  that  the  global  recovery  is  very  dissimilar  between  advanced  and  emerging 
economies.  The  US,  Europe  and  Japan  are  growing  slowly  and  have  high  levels  of  idle 
capacity  and  unemployment.  The  financial  crisis  has  caused  them  lasting  damage  in  the 
  1
balance  sheets  of  consumers,  banks  and  governments  that  will  take  years  to  heal.  Most 
likely,  their  demands  will  continue  to  grow  slowly.  Recent  financial  turbulences  in  Europe 
confirm this scenario.  
This  situation  contrasts with  growth  in  Latin  America  and emerging  Asia.  In  the  past  year, 
these  economies  have  grown  above  trend,  thanks  to  still  expansionary  macroeconomic 
policies,  increased  external  funding  available  and,  in  our  region,  improved  terms  of  trade. 
Output  gaps  are  near  exhaustion  and  policy-makers  are  withdrawing  their  stimulus  to 
demand in order to avoid an inflationary resurgence and generate a sustainable growth path. 
The main projections of the world economy foresee that this disparity between emerging and 
advanced economies will go on for the next two years. These aspects will be addressed in 
more detail next week when we present our December 2010 Monetary Policy Report. 
The real issue here is that the recovery of the developed world will not hold if it happens at 
the expense of repeating the current account deficits of the pre-crisis years. A recomposition 
of  global  demand  is  necessary.  The  crisis  has  left  an  excess  of  savings  in  the  world  that 
drives  down  the  international  real  interest  rate.  Meanwhile,  the  weakness  of  advanced 
economies leads us to believe that they will hold on to their low monetary policy rates for a 
very  long  time.  These  low  real  interest  rates  help  boost  domestic  demand  in  surplus 
economies  with  sound  financial  systems,  like  ours.  The  consequence  is  a  global  re-
accommodation  of  the  currencies:  deficit  countries  depreciate  their  real  exchange  rates, 
while the rest of the world appreciate theirs. 
Within this context, the currencies of most emerging and/or commodity exporting economies 
are facing pressures for a real appreciation. The Chilean peso is part of this process of global 
parity re-accommodation. Our currency has appreciated significantly with respect to that of 
deficit-ridden economies: the US, the UK and, to a lesser extent, the Eurozone. However, it 
remains  stable  or  has  depreciated  with  respect  to  the  currencies  of  other  emerging  or 
commodity exporting economies (figure 2). 
One problem is that not every country is contributing to the foreign exchange adjustment at 
the same pace. Such a disparity creates tensions in the world economy. In the Eurozone, the 
rigidity  imposed  by  the  single  currency  slows  down  the  real  exchange  rate  adjustment 
between economies that are going through very different stages in the cycle. In China, high 
savings and foreign exchange market interventions hinder the adjustment. This can amplify 
the effects on other currencies in emerging and commodity exporting economies.  
However, underlying pressures continue to manifest themselves in other ways. In the deficit 
economies  of  the  Eurozone,  the  recession  and  its  accompanying  deflationary  pressures 
depreciate  the  real  exchange  rate.  In  emerging  Asia,  the  acceleration  of  spending  and 
increased  inflationary  pressures  appreciate  the  real  exchange  rate.  Eventually,  the  foreign 
exchange  regime  affects  the  real  exchange  rate’s  behavior  only  temporarily,  and  the 
adjustment arrives sooner or later by other ways, some times at a greater cost.   
Improved terms of trade 
Another  factor  influencing  the  exchange  rate’s  behavior  has  been  the  improvement  of  our 
terms  of  trade.  Along  the  past  ten  years,  the  ratio  between  the  price  of  our  exports  and 
imports,  i.e.,  the  terms  of  trade,  has  almost  doubled.  As  of  the  third  quarter  of  2010,  the 
terms of trade exceeded the average for the last two decades by more than 60%. Underlying 
this  increment  are  the  higher  prices  of  copper,  iron,  wood  pulp  and  other  commodities 
relative to manufactured goods, partly attenuated by the oil price increases (figure 3). 
Improved of trade lead to an increase in the real national income – the sum of wages, profits 
and  taxes  –  faster  than  the  expansion  of  our  productive  capacity.  To  the  extent  that  this 
higher  national  income  is  perceived  as  permanent  by  policy-makers  and  private  agents,  it 
stimulates expenditure and puts pressure on the installed capacity, the domestic interest rate 
and, ultimately, the real exchange rate. 
2 
 In  the  case  of  fiscal  earnings,  for  over  twenty  years  our  country  has  implemented  a 
responsible, prudential fiscal policy, generating fiscal surpluses for most of the period. Such 
a  policy  has  sought  to  save  the  transitory  income  from  copper,  cushioning  the  impact  of 
terms  of  trade  cycles  on  fiscal  expenditure,  demand,  and  the  real  exchange  rate.  When 
confronted  with  the  worst  international  recession  since  the  Great  Depression,  this  fiscal 
prudence  allowed  putting  in  place  countercyclical  measures  that  had  no  precedent  in  our 
economic history. 
In  the  present  circumstances  where  the  economy  has  already  gained  momentum,  it  is 
adequate  to  withdraw  part  of  the  fiscal  stimulus.  The  plan  of  gradual  reduction  of  the 
structural fiscal deficit announced by the government will contribute to moderate demand and 
remove  some  pressure  from  the  real  exchange  rate,  although  its  effects  will  become 
apparent gradually over time.  
Beyond the business cycle, it is also worth mentioning that the persistence of high copper 
prices  in  the  world  markets  has  been  translating  into  better  expectations  for  its  long-term 
price. In the first five years of the fiscal rule of structural balance, the average reference price 
for copper was, in real terms as of today, US$1.14 per pound; now it is more than twice, at 
US$2.59 per pound. The higher earnings from copper have allowed financing an important 
increase in public spending as a percentage of GDP and greater transfers over the past few 
years. This situation has consequences also on the real exchange rate. 
Reduced net debtor position 
Throughout  the  years,  the  flip  side  of  the  structural  fiscal  surplus  has  been  a  significant 
reduction in public debt as a percentage of GDP, accumulated resources in foreign currency 
in sovereign funds, and an improvement of the net financial position of the Chilean economy 
relative  to  the  rest  of  the  world.  This  improvement  also  contributes  to  a  more  appreciated 
exchange rate via lower sovereign risk, access to external credit in more favorable conditions 
and a higher permanent income from interests paid on savings abroad (figure 4). 
Sectoral heterogeneity 
Because of heterogeneity in global recovery and currency evolution, the average path of the 
real exchange rate blurs the diversity of bilateral or regional parities. As I have pointed out 
before, the peso’s real appreciation centers in the US and Europe, while it is more stable with 
respect to the currencies of other emerging economies or commodity exporters that compete 
with Chile in various markets (figure 5).  
Such  a  disparity  means  that  the  effects  of  the  appreciation  of  the  peso  have  been 
heterogeneous  across  the  different  economic  sectors.  In  some,  the  appreciation  has  been 
more  than  offset  by  higher  export  prices  (mining),  while  in  others  the  effects  have  been 
mitigated  by  appreciated  currencies  in  some  countries  of  destination.  The  agricultural 
industry, where nearly 70% of its sales go the United States and Europe, has seen a greater 
appreciation (figure 6). 
Monetary policy and exchange rate intervention 
III. 
Last October, when I was invited to the House of Representatives to analyze the exchange 
rate, I said there are three major principles in monetary policy conduct.  
The first is that the Central Bank is not indifferent to exchange rate movements. Compliance 
with our constitutional mandate demands adopting measures to orient the economy toward 
full use of its resources and ensuring a balance of payments that is sustainable over time. 
The international price of our currency is a very important variable in the Chilean economy’s 
performance,  as  it  affects  growth,  inflation  and  the  external  accounts,  and  ultimately  our 
monetary policy decisions. For example, in recent months the appreciation of the peso has 
  3
helped attenuate inflationary pressures stemming from narrowing output gaps. This has been 
an input in our decisions so, were it not for the strengthened exchange rate, our monetary 
policy interest rate would probably be higher than it actually is.   
A second principle is careful assessment of our decisions’ effectiveness, costs and benefits. 
We  make  no  decision  without  being  technically  convinced  that  it  will  be  effective  and 
convenient for the economy as a  whole. Acting otherwise would only erode our reputation 
and credibility, indispensable elements for achieving our objectives at the lowest social cost 
possible.  
Finally, a third principle is that the Central Bank of Chile does not use the exchange rate to 
target inflation. Our history and that of the region is paved with stabilization measures based 
on the exchange rate, which generated severe setbacks, and ended in balance of payments 
crisis,  financial  turmoil  and  economic  disasters.  For  this  reason,  we  have  evolved  into  a 
floating exchange rate regime, which permits to better reconcile the stability of the Chilean 
economy with the volatility of the external scenario. 
This is not the time or the place for a lengthy discussion on the subject; suffice it to recall that 
every economic crisis in Chile over the past fifty years – except the recession of 2009 we are 
leaving  behind  with  unprecedented  vigor  –  have  been  associated  to  exchange  rate 
misalignments  and  rigidities.  Furthermore,  a  very  significant  element  to  explain  why  the 
emerging economies were spared the worst effects of the recent global crisis was that their 
currencies  floated,  which  allowed  them  to  absorb  the  shocks,  eliminated  the  invitation  to 
investors to wager against currency weakening and opened room to relax monetary policy 
and provide liquidity. 
However,  although  a  floating  exchange  rate  has  many  advantages  for  economic  and 
financial  stability,  it  may  happen  that,  at  times  of  high  uncertainty  or  excessive  optimism, 
financial  flows  could  persistently  push  the  real  exchange  rate  away  from  its  medium-  and 
long-term  fundamentals,  with  negative  effects  on  the  economy.  In  such  situations,  the 
Central Bank may intervene in the foreign exchange market with the purpose of mitigating or 
eliminating  these  imbalances.  If  the  exchange  rate  is  actually  misaligned  from  its 
fundamentals, the intervention will have a better chance to amend the situation, while it will 
also bring financial benefits. Conversely, if these are fundamental trends, the intervention will 
have transitory effects at best, at a substantial cost. 
Since  the  implementation  of  the  floating  regime  at  the  end  of  the  last  decade,  we  have 
intervened in the foreign exchange market on three occasions. In the current circumstances 
we have not ruled it out. It is an option we are permanently evaluating.  
I want to go deeper into the elements that are weighed for this decision.  
It  is  always  possible  to  design  an  intervention  of  such  magnitude  that  it  can  affect  the 
evolution of the nominal exchange rate. But this has other consequences on the economy 
that need consideration. 
One such consequence is the need to sterilize the monetary effects of the intervention. The 
money that is issued to buy the dollars must be taken out; otherwise monetary policy would 
be  subordinated  to  the  exchange  rate  objective,  jeopardizing  the  stability  of  growth  and 
inflation. This sterilization pressures long-term interest rates upward, which has an impact on 
activity,  while  inducing  capital  inflows  that  render  the  intervention  ineffective.  In  turn,  the 
intervention  entails  high  financial  costs,  because  financing  the  intervention  via  debt  costs 
more  than  the  returns  on  the  international  reserves,  except,  as  I  said  before,  when  it  is 
grounded on the expectation of an important correction of the exchange rate misalignment.  
We  must  also  consider  the  coherence  of  the  intervention  with  the  rest  of  the  economy.  A 
sufficiently bulky intervention could sustain a more depreciated nominal exchange rate, even 
if fundamental forces point to appreciation. However, these pressures to appreciate will take 
the form of higher inflation as they will drive demand for national goods to grow too fast. In 
the medium term, the real exchange rate is the same, but inflation is higher when the foreign 
4 
 exchange rate adjustment mechanism is locked. Some emerging economies that have tried 
to  avoid  the  nominal  appreciation  of  their  currencies  are  seeing  a  faster  acceleration  of 
inflation because the acceleration of expenditure squeezes internal production capacity.  
As I said, currencies are appreciating around the world, even in Asian and Latin American 
countries that have intervened in the market and adopted other types of financial measures 
to contain this appreciation (figure 7). In fact, interventions may have attenuated somewhat 
the nominal exchange rate appreciation, but at the end what we are seeking is to affect the 
real  exchange  rate,  and  the  evidence  on  the  matter  shows  that,  on  average,  there  is  no 
obvious connection between the level of the countries’ interventions and the behavior of their 
real exchange rate (figure 8). 
In Chile, the latest intervention occurred in April 2008, with visible effects on the exchange 
rate. At the time, the real exchange rate was more appreciated than today, and it was only a 
few  weeks  before  the  financial  crisis  took  a  turn  for  the  worse  after  the  collapse  of  Bear 
Stearns, which warranted strengthening our international reserves position in the face of a 
very volatile global economic and financial scenario. The exchange rate depreciated in the 
first  weeks  after  we  announced  the  intervention,  but  the  subsequent  depreciation  in  the 
following months coincided with a widespread weakening of emerging currencies, increased 
risk aversion in global financial markets, a strengthened dollar and a fall in Treasury bonds’ 
interest rates. 
But it is also helpful to learn from other episodes, and an interesting one happened in 1997, 
when  the  real  exchange  rate  hit  its  lowest  since  the  crisis  of  the  peg  in  1982.  That 
intervention amounted to around 4% of GDP, there were capital controls, net capital inflows 
were at 8.1% of GDP, the copper price was at US$1.42 per pound in dollars of today, and 
the  net  international  position  was  more  to  the  debt  side,  at  50%  of  GDP.  Certainly,  the 
floating regime, a monetary policy more aligned with international interest rates, and reduced 
capital inflows have been key in limiting the amplitude of exchange rate fluctuations. 
I want to highlight that net capital inflows to Chile are now less than the peaks we saw in the 
1990s. Currently, capital inflows to the emerging world – particularly Latin America – have 
resumed pre-crisis levels but are still below those of the 1990s (figure 9). This is largely due 
to  improved  growth  prospects  in  the  emerging    markets  and  to  the  fact  that  while  in  the 
advanced  economies  interest  rates  are  and  will  continue  to  be  low,  in  emerging  countries 
monetary policy rates have been going up, to very high levels in some of them (figure 10). 
In  Chile,  the  current  account  balance  for  this  year  (i.e.,  our  expenditures  in  excess  of  our 
income) will be not too different from zero, which means that there will not be a significant net 
capital inflow to finance excess spending (figure 11). It is thus important to note that I have 
not mentioned among the causes of the peso appreciation net capital inflows, which in some 
countries may be having some significant impact. In the 1990s we did receive substantial net 
capital inflows, but today they are not the main point. Certainly this calls for continual follow-
up because the funds will always flow to the economies with the better prospects for growth, 
including Chile. As I said, sometimes these flows can trigger lasting misalignments in the real 
exchange rate with respect to its trend fundamentals.  
Final remarks 
IV. 
We are well aware of the challenges facing exporters under the present circumstances. In 
particular,  we  understand  the  difficulties  exporters  in  the  agricultural  sector  are  enduring, 
whose  primary  destinations  –  Europe  and  the  US  –  have  not  fully  recovered  yet  from  the 
financial  crisis,  and  with  which  our  currency  has  appreciated  more.  This  situation  is 
particularly  complex  in  some  regions.  At  the  country  level,  however,  it  must  be  said  that 
production, employment, wages and investment are growing strongly. Our economy is totally 
back on its feet after the global recession and the outlook is good. 
  5
I am convinced that our country must grow in a harmonious way and the benefits of progress 
must spread to all the country. Economic growth and global integration generate sectoral and 
regional  adjustments;  some  economic  activities  expand  and  some  contract,  with  all  the 
associated  tensions.  This  is  what  progress  is  all  about.  To  mitigate  the  costs  of  sectoral 
adjustments – and, above all, the social costs involved – without hurting economic growth, 
public policies face a tremendous challenge, but the instruments with macroeconomic reach 
such as the exchange rate are ineffective when it comes to resolving sectoral difficulties. 
Next week we will be presenting our Monetary Policy Report. We hope that our economy will 
continue dynamic over the next 24 months, boosting higher income and employment for our 
people.  Our  role  is  to  ensure  that  the  process  is  sustainable  in  an  environment  of  stable 
prices. We will watch over it taking every measure necessary. 
In  this  presentation  I  have  shown  all  the  factors  that  may  explain  parity  adjustments. 
However, many of the elements now pressuring the exchange rate may be reversed in the 
long term. As a matter of fact, today the real exchange rate is around the minimum levels 
believed to be consistent with its long-term fundamentals, hence the importance we assign to 
this issue.  
So  far  we  have  not  intervened  in  the  foreign  exchange  market  or  taken  any  exceptional 
measures  because  we  do  not  think  they  are  justified  considering  what  I  have  been 
presenting.  We  do  not  rule  out  these  options,  but  it  will  depend  on  the  evolution  of  our 
economy and its relevant external environment, in the current highly volatile scenario. The 
Central Bank of Chile will continue to orient its policies to safeguard the economy’s stability 
and ensure propitious conditions for growth in our country. 
Thank you.
