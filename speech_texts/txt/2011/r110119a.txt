José De Gregorio: Policy responses to the global crisis 
Presentation  by  Mr  José  De  Gregorio,  Governor  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Chile,  at  the 
conference “Monetary Policy and Central Banking in the Post Crisis Environment”, Santiago, 
17 January 2011. 
 In  the  last  years  economic  policymakers  have  had  to  deal  with  many  unprecedented 
challenges.  The  severe  inflationary  shock  that  began  in  2007  was  followed  by  the  worst 
financial crisis since the Great Depression and the deepest worldwide economic recession in 
the postwar period. Currently, even though recovery is underway, the rebound in economic 
activity  has  been  characterized  by  a  dichotomy:  whereas  emerging  countries  are  posting 
strong  growth  rates,  in  the  developed  world  activity  is  sluggish,  with  high  unemployment 
rates and excess capacity. This bifurcated economic scenario has brought many tensions to 
the global economy. 
In Chile, to the shocks that have affected the world economy in this period, one has to add 
the earthquake and tsunami that hit our country almost a year ago and that had both short 
and medium-term effects on our economy.  
One of the main lessons we have learned these years is the importance of having a robust 
policy  framework.  In  the  case  of  Chile,  institutional  developments,  low  level  of  public  debt 
and high availability of liquidity allowed unusual vigor in monetary and fiscal policy to confront 
the  negative  effects  on  demand  and  output  of  all  the  shocks  that  have  affected  us. 
Macroeconomic stability was preserved and performance of the Chilean economy was much 
better  than  in  previous  world  recessions  (figure  1).  Also,  the  financial  system  endured  the 
global  financial  crisis  with  no  setbacks,  no  systemically  important  financial  institutions 
experienced major stress, and macroeconomic policies set the stage for the healthy recovery 
we are witnessing now.  
The  macroeconomic  framework  of  the  Chilean  economy  was  very  important  in  attaining 
these  results.  This  framework  rests  on  four  pillars.  First,  monetary  policy  management  is 
based on a flexible inflation-targeting regime, conducted by an autonomous central bank and 
supported  by  a  floating  exchange  rate  system.  The  inflation  targeting  scheme  considers  a 
3% annual inflation target, with a two-year horizon to correct deviations and a ±1 percentage 
point  tolerance  range.1  The  floating  exchange  rate  regime  includes  the  possibility  of 
intervening  in  the  foreign  exchange  market  under  exceptional  circumstances,  which  has 
happened four times since September 1999. Second, a fiscal policy that is accountable and 
predictable  thanks  to  a  structural  balance  rule.2  The  significant  amount  of  savings 
accumulated  during  the  run-up  of  copper  prices  was  a  crucial  factor  in  bolstering  the 
resilience  of  the  Chilean  economy  and  in  providing  a  countercyclical  fiscal  boost.  Third,  a 
high  degree  of  commercial  and  financial  integration  with  the  rest  of  the  world.  Although 
copper still accounts for a relevant portion of Chilean exports, an important number of new 
markets for a variety of products have been opened thanks to both the unilateral efforts of 
trade  liberalization  and  the  significant  spread  of  bilateral  trade  agreements  with  the  major 
economic  countries  and  zones.  Finally,  a  sound  financial  system,  with  globally  integrated, 
well-capitalized,  and  adequately-regulated  banks.  Actually,  the  regulation  of  the  domestic 
banking  system  prevented  some  of  the  most  notorious  credit  excesses  that  happened  in 
advanced economies, or in the past of many emerging markets, including Chile.

I will continue my presentation speaking about how all the shocks we have seen the last few 
years have affected the Chilean economy and  the policy responses we have put in place. 
Then I will describe the recovery process and I will finalize presenting some thoughts on the 
lessons  that  can  be  drawn  from  our  recent  experience  and  some  challenges  I  see  for  the 
future.  
The run-up to the financial bust 
By  March  2008,  Bear  Stearns  had  already  gone  bankrupt  and  the  risk  of  a  higher  stress 
episode at the world financial markets had increased greatly. Due to the risks of a potential 
sudden stop if the financial crisis should worsen, and in a context of a severe appreciation of 
the Chilean peso, in April, the Central Bank decided to start accumulating reserves through 
sterilized intervention.  
In Chile, domestic demand grew rapidly in the run-up to the crisis. During 2004–2007, the 
average  annual  growth  of  output  was  5.3%,  while  the  average  growth  rate  of  domestic 
demand  was  8.1%.  Private  consumption  grew  7.2%  and  investment  12.1%.  The  faster 
growth of demand than output is explained by a significant improvement in our terms of trade 
on the back of higher prices for copper and other commodities. 
In  2007,  Chile,  like  many  other  economies  in  the  world,  suffered  a  significant  inflationary 
process,  which  only  worsened  during  2008  (figure  2).  Perhaps  the  most  remarkable 
component  of  this  inflationary  process  was  how  strongly  the  increase  in  international  food 
prices was transmitted domestically. This may have partially been due to Chile’s high degree 
of commercial openness and little distortions in the price setting mechanism. Another factor 
underlying inflation pressures, and a deceleration of growth, was the higher cost of energy 
(especially  electricity)  that  hit  the  Chilean  economy  with  particular  strength  (figure  3).  Not 
only thermoelectric power plants had to operate with more costly inputs, but also unfavorable 
hydrological conditions and a severe shortage of natural gas implied that these more efficient 
sources of generation had to be replaced by diesel, in the context of rising oil prices.  
Inflation rose from an annual rate of 2.6% in December 2006 to 9.9% in October 2008, when 
the  rise  of  food  and  energy  prices  had  also  propagated  to  the  rest  of  consumer  goods. 
Hence,  the  risks  of  inflation  remaining  above  the  target  beyond  the  policy  horizon  grew 
strongly.  Consistently,  monetary  policy  had  a  strong  reaction.  The  Monetary  Policy  Rate 
(MPR) was increased by 200 basis points in just four months, starting in June. By September 
2008, before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Central Bank estimated that it would be 
necessary to increase the MPR further, even above market expectations.  
Monetary and fiscal policy during the crisis 
As in most of the world economies, financial tensions in Chile were severe after the collapse 
of  Lehman  Brothers.  Interest  rates  in  both  peso  and  dollar  markets  posted  substantial 
increases in the most stressful times from mid-September to mid-October 2008 (Figure 4). 
The Central Bank acted quickly, providing peso and dollar liquidity facilities to the financial 
system to mitigate liquidity tensions, but also to ensure financing in foreign currency should 
foreign  loans  become  scarce.  Also,  the  foreign  exchange  reserves  accumulation  process 
was cancelled. Local money market conditions normalized rapidly, over a period of weeks. 
The  additional  liquidity  facilities  put  in  place  were  not  used  extensively  by  financial 
institutions, reflecting their sustained access to external markets.  
Beyond  the  stressful  episodes  in  local  money  markets,  the  global  confidence  crisis  that 
swept  around  the  world  was  very  important  in  Chile.  The  events  of  developed  financial 
markets  prompted  a  deep  and  widespread  revision  of  investment  and  spending  plans  of 
businesses and households, bringing expenditure to a halt. Domestic demand and economic 
activity dropped significantly and lending standards tightened (figure 5).

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
The  inflation  outlook  changed  radically,  and  monetary  policy  reacted  forcefully.  First,  by 
communicating a change in outlook and the bias of monetary policy, inducing an important 
decline in market rates at all horizons. Then, in January 2009, with a clearer assessment of 
the reduced inflationary pressures, the MPR was lowered by 100 basis points. Later, with the 
evidence of alleviated inflationary pressures and a sharp contraction in demand, the Central 
Bank  decided  to  cut  the  MPR  by  250  basis  points  at  both  its  meetings  of  February  and 
March.  The  monetary  easing  process  continued  and  completed  775  basis  points  in  seven 
monthly  meetings,  bringing  the  MPR  to  0.50%  in  July  2009,  the  minimum  level  deemed 
adequate for a normal functioning of money markets (figure 6). In addition, the Central Bank 
also announced that the MPR would be held constant at this minimum level for a prolonged 
period  of  time.  In  order  to  strengthen  the  commitment  to  this  announcement,  which  goes 
beyond  the  regular  monthly  MPR  setting,  the  Bank  adopted  some  non-conventional 
monetary policy measures, extending the overnight liquidity facility for banks at the MPR to 
180-day  term  through  a  term  liquidity  facility  (Facilidad  de  Liquidez  a  Plazo,  FLAP).  The 
extraordinary liquidity measures provided during the crisis extinguished in mid 2010 and their 
withdrawal did not generate stress in the money market. 
The  shift  to  a  countercyclical  policy  stance  was  also  taken  forcefully  on  fiscal  policy.  In 
January 2009, the government announced a sizable fiscal stimulus package, amounting to 
US$4 billion for that year, equivalent to 3% of GDP.  
The recovery process 
The economic recovery was faster than expected. In the second half of 2009, activity grew at 
an annualized rate of around 6%. Key factors in this trend included the increase in private 
consumption and the recovery of investment. Initially, the recovery of  private demand was 
due mostly to the rebuilding of inventories, it continued with the dynamism of consumption 
and gross fixed capital formation. This contrasts with the situation in advanced economies 
where after inventories recovered, private demand has been sluggish due to the very weak 
financial position of households. Several indicators available until end February of 2010 were 
pointing to a consolidation of the consumption and activity trend. But then, on February 27th, 
the fifth strongest earthquake ever measured hit our country. 
The huge initial contraction of aggregate output was largely concentrated in manufacturing. 
The immediate disruptions of the productive processes due to 27-F dissipated quickly and by 
the  second  quarter  of  the  year  output  exceeded  the  levels  prior  to  the  earthquake.  The 
economy remained on a growth trend and inflation has been below expectations, owing to 
lower imported inflation and some specific factors. The baseline scenario of our December 
Monetary Policy Report assumes that the Chilean economy grew 5.2% in 2010 and that GDP 
growth  will  stand  between  5.5  and  6.5%  during  2011.  Median  private  expectation  set  the 
growth rate for 2012 at 5.5%. Economic growth projections assume that output gaps are near 
exhaustion and will stay thus over the whole policy horizon. 
The normalization process for monetary policy started in June with a 50 basis point hike and 
continued the following four months at the same speed. Between October and December the 
normalization  pace  was  slowed  down  to  25  basis  points.  In  January  the  Monetary  Policy 
Rate was kept unchanged, but the Board has stated that it will be necessary to continue to 
reduce the monetary policy stimulus in the coming months.  
But,  important  risks  persist  on  this  scenario.  As  I  mentioned  at  the  beginning  of  my 
presentation, the risks in the external scenario are high, especially due to the fact that global 
recovery  has  been  imbalanced  between  developed  and  emerging  economies,  with  high 
commodity  prices,  low  interest  rates,  a  sluggish  recovery  of  developed  economies  and  a 
depreciated  US  dollar.  Relevant  risks  include  escalating  financial  tensions  in  Europe, 
persistent  high  unemployment  rates  in  developed  economies  and  sharper  adjustments  in 
some emerging economies that are facing inflationary pressures. Considering this risks and 
the fact that the real exchange rate had appreciated significantly, the Board of the Central 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

Bank  decided,  on  January  3rd,  to  start  a  program  of  foreign  currency  purchases  aimed  at 
strengthening its international liquidity position. Thus, the Central Bank will hoard additional 
international  reserves  amounting  to  US$12.0  billion  over  the  year  2011,  via  periodic 
purchases of foreign currency until the end of December of 2011. This program will take the 
Central  Bank’s  international  liquidity  position  to  the  equivalent  of  17%  of  GDP,  which  is 
comparable with those of other economies similar to Chile (figure 7).  
The monetary effects of this measure will be sterilized in order to keep a liquidity provision in 
pesos  in  the  market  in  line  with  the  target  for  the  monetary  policy  rate.  The  hoarding  of 
international reserves entails financial costs for the Central Bank associated to the differential 
between the return on investments and the cost of financing them. The level proposed for the 
international reserves is consistent with the Central Bank’s financial sustainability, although 
additional  leeway  is  limited.  The  initial  reaction  to  this  announcement  was  a  nearly  5% 
depreciation of the peso.  
Nonetheless,  the  intervention  does  not  pursue  a  specific  level  for  the  exchange  rate.  Our 
immediate  target  is  to  achieve  the  stated  level  of  reserves,  about  17%  of  GDP,  and  to 
alleviate exchange rate tensions. We remain committed to a floating exchange rate system, 
and the exchange rate will keep floating during the intervention period. 
For  an  economy  like  Chile,  which  can  encounter  significant  changes  in  external  financial 
conditions and in the terms of trade, foreign exchange flexibility is an essential ingredient of 
its macroeconomic and financial stability. Within a volatile environment like that of the past 
few  years,  the  inflation  targeting  regime  with  a  floating  exchange  rate  has  displayed  its 
benefits  in  terms  of  allowing  a  smoother  trajectory  of  the  Chilean  economy.  Our  floating 
regime  admits  interventions  in  exceptional  situations,  like  the  one  announced  at  the 
beginning of the month.  
Nonetheless, it is important to consider that beyond the evolution of the dollar in international 
markets, there are some more long-lasting elements underlying the real appreciation of the 
peso,  such  as  improved  terms  of  trade,  the  accumulated  increase  in  the  ratio  of  public 
expenditure  to  GDP  and  the  reduction  in  our  net  debtor  position  relative  to  the  rest  of  the 
world.  The  effects  of  these  factors  on  the  real  exchange  rate  and  the  competitiveness  of 
some sectors goes beyond the horizon of the effects of this intervention. Those sectors need 
to  improve  their  productivity  and  reallocate  their  exports  to  growing  emerging  markets  in 
order to remain competitive. 
In any case, additional reserves available will allow to better deal with the contingency of a 
significant  deterioration  of  the  external  environment.  Foreign  exchange  markets  are  under 
stress and currencies are adjusting asymmetrically. There is also the risk that GDP growth 
decoupling  between  advanced  and  emerging  economies  will  persist  longer  than  expected, 
thus intensifying the pressure on the exchange rate. Accordingly, the effects of this measure, 
although  temporary,  should  open  room  for  smoother  real  adjustments  in  the  domestic 
economy. 
Final thoughts and challenges 
The ability of macroeconomic policies in developing economies to react swiftly was essential 
to reduce the impact of the global crisis. The answer of monetary and fiscal policies and a 
sound  and  well  regulated  financial  system  were  key  factors  in  the  ability  to  withstand  and 
recover from all the hard times we have had to face in the last few years. 
The Chilean economy has picked up strongly. Expansionary policies applied have paid off. 
The  current  recovery  process  has  posed  two  main  challenges  to  emerging  market 
economies. The first one has to do with the appreciation of currencies and the resumption of 
capital inflows. And the second, with the need to control inflation in an environment of rising 
commodity prices.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches
Massive capital inflows are not a problem in Chile, as we have a current account surplus; 
therefore,  in  net  terms  we  are  lending  to  the  rest  of  the  world.  In  contrast,  some  other 
countries  see  this  as  a  problem  as  economies  grow  strongly  and  current  account  deficits 
widen despite gains in terms of trade. Some economies are using capital controls to temper 
the pressures. Despite the fact that this is not a relevant issue now in Chile, in a longer-term 
view, the effectiveness of this type of measures has to be carefully evaluated. At least, the 
evidence  for  Chile  shows  that  the  effects  of  capital  controls  during  the  1990s  were  very 
limited at best.3 
Overall,  the  currencies  of  most  emerging  and  commodity-exporting  countries  have  been 
appreciating,  regardless  of  the  presence  of  net  capital  inflows.  It  is  possible  to  mitigate 
transitorily  its  effects  on  the  real  economy,  but  longer-term  actions  need  to  be  taken  to 
support  competitiveness.  But,  in  a  world  scenario  with  greater  importance  of  emerging 
market  economies,  their  currencies  will  be  stronger  than  in  the  past.  A  more  balanced 
recovery of the world economy should alleviate tensions. 
Commodity  prices  have  been  rising  in  the  last  few  months,  owing  to  a  large  extent  to  the 
strong  growth  of  emerging  market  economies. Although  they  represent  supply  shocks  that 
change relative prices, and in addition the supply response should mitigate this rise in the 
longer term, the short-term challenges are significant. The role of monetary policy is to avert 
second round effects that could contaminate inflation dynamics. For this reason, and in the 
context of solid growth and closed output gaps, monetary policy should gradually tighten in 
emerging markets, something we have been doing in Chile. 
Today the overall challenge for policymakers is to allow for sustainable growth. The Central 
Bank will fulfill its purpose and will continue to use its policies with flexibility, as proven in the 
recent  intervention  announcement,  so  that  projected  inflation  stands  at  3%  over  the  policy 
horizon. This is the best contribution the Central Bank makes to Chile’s welfare and growth 
potential.

found some effects of reducing the extent of the appreciation is Edwards and Rigobon (2009). However, the 
magnitude  of  such  effect  is  small,  since  the  elimination  of  capital  controls  from  its  maximum  would  have 
appreciated the exchange rate between 2  and 2.5%. In any case, it is useful to recall that the highest real 
exchange  rate  appreciation  in  the  last  20  years  in  Chile  occurred  in  1997,  the  year  that  featured  capital 
controls, massive reserve accumulation, an exchange rate band and high interest rates.
