    The global economy – unbalanced and fragile recovery 
Since  the  beginning  of  the  global  financial  crisis,  uncertainty  about  economic 
recovery  and  economic  prospects  in  general  has  been  elevated.  What  initially 
appeared to be an exceptionally rapid recovery after an exceptionally deep financial 
crisis turned out to be very fragile, unbalanced and globally uneven. 
Unlike  in  periods  after  earlier  crisis  episodes,  this  time  growth  rates  in  industrial 
countries  remained  at  moderate  levels,  unemployment  rates  ceased  to  decline 
further and private consumption remained hesitant. The need to consolidate fiscal 
balances  in  all  industrial  countries  after  rapid  deterioration  further  dampened 
consumer and business confidence. In some cases, the weakness of the recovery 
was amplified by adverse shocks such as the fatal earthquake in Japan.

 Many  emerging  markets,  by  contrast,  struggled  with  an  overheated  economy  and 
mounting  inflation.  Massive  capital  inflows  put  upward  pressure  on  the  exchange 
rate and harbor the risk of sudden reversals. Monetary and fiscal tightening as well 
as  exchange  rate  interventions  were  initiated  to  cool  demand,  curb  inflation  and 
prevent the build-up of asset price bubbles, but the success of these measures has 
been only limited. 
In  such  an  environment,  adverse  economic  data  and  uncertainty  about  policy 
decisions  can  have  severe  effects  on  financial  markets.  With  the  protraction  of 
negotiations about the lifting of the U.S. budget ceiling and the series of emergency 
meetings  to  solve  the  European  debt  crisis,  market  participants  have  become 
increasingly  nervous.  During  the  summer  months,  when  markets  are,  in  general, 
relatively  dry  and  rely  heavily  on  automatic  stop-loss  policies,  adverse  tendencies 
can  easily  become  self-perpetuating.  In  such  an  environment,  even  good  news

 After the downgrading of U.S. debt and a series of adverse economic data releases, 
stock  market  prices  plummeted  around  the  world.  At  the  same  time,  demand  for 
U.S.  bonds  increased  –  a  clear  sign  that  investors  seek  safe  haven  investment 
alternatives  in  a  highly  uncertain  environment.  At  the  European  level,  we  recently 
observed an increase in recourse to the Eurosystem’s deposit facility, an alarming 
indication for mounting distrust among commercial banks.  
This re-emergence of financial market tensions led to swift monetary policy action 
worldwide.  Central  banks,  which  had  already  started  to  phase  out  some  of  their 
exceptional  policy  measures  implemented  during  the  crisis  and  had  begun  the

expansionary policy measures. The Federal Reserve announced its commitment to 
keep key interest rates at the current low level at least until 2013. The Eurosystem 
responded to increasing liquidity needs by re-introducing longer-term (i.e. 6-month) 
liquidity  operations.  This  will  ensure  that  banks’  temporary  liquidity  constraints  do 
not turn into solvency problems.  
Overall uncertainty is currently exceptionally high, not only with regard to the further 
speed of recovery, but also with regard to the ability of policy action to re-establish 
market confidence. Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, recently referred to 
the current situation as the worst crisis since the Second World War.

  While  I  see  important  parallels  to  the  situation  of  2008,  I  also  see  important 
differences.  Back  then,  private  indebtedness  was  at  the  origin  of  the  crisis.  Since 
then,  households,  businesses  and 
institutions  have  deleveraged 
successfully.  Saving  ratios  have  reached  solid  levels,  the  capital  endowments  of 
most  banks  are  healthy,  and  asset  bubbles  and  overly  optimistic  business  ratings 
have  bounced  back.  In  the  current  crisis,  by  contrast,  it  is  the  excessive  public 
indebtedness  of  individual  countries  that  is  at  the  origin  of  market  tensions  –  a 
problem that will have to be solved at a completely different level.

Five lessons to be learned from the global financial crisis 
The  global  financial  crisis  shares  several  characteristics  with  past  crisis  episodes. 
Among  these  are  the  rapid  financial  market  liberalization  in  the  years  prior  to  the 
crisis  in  combination  with  an  insufficient  regulatory  framework,  a  build-up  of  asset 
price bubbles and the widening of global imbalances. An exceptionally long period of 
high growth and low inflation made financial market participants less aware of risks. 
All these factors promoted an unsustainable explosion of asset prices and private 
indebtedness.  
At  the  same  time,  the  global  financial  crisis  was  in  several  respects  unique  and 
required  policy  reactions  in  uncharted  waters.  Central  bankers  had  to  learn  to 
expand  their  portfolio  of  policy  instruments.  In  addition  to  cutting  interest  rate  to 
historically low levels, central banks around the world provided ample liquidity at a 
higher frequency and with longer maturities to a larger group of financial institutions 
and against an extended list of collateral, agreed on foreign exchange swap lines 
and entered new territories by buying assets on secondary markets. 
A factor that was seriously underestimated was the global character of the crisis and 
the  international  linkages  that  go  beyond  trade  links.  This  particular  factor 
contributed to uncertainties about economic prospects and required an unseen level 
of international policy coordination.  
– 
A first lesson to be learned from the past crisis is the need to rewrite not only 
economic theory, but especially our forecasting and risk models. Traditionally, 
these models omit many potentially important contagion channels such as the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

sudden reversal of capital flows or the correlation of business and consumer 
confidence across continents. At the same time, many historical patterns and 
regularities are still valid, but need to be reassessed in the light of the most 
recent experience. We should learn our lesson from history, being extremely 
careful with ex ante assessments that state – in the words of Carmen Reinhart 
and Kenneth Rogoff – that “this time is different.” 
A  specific  aspect  that  was  underestimated  was  the  impact  of  the  global 
interlacement  of  the  financial  system.  Today,  calamities  of  single  financial 
institutions may quickly provoke a chain reaction and ultimately lead to a systemic 
crisis. This calls for the global coordination of supervisory activities. 
– 
The second lesson to be learned is thus that the health of a single financial 
institution  is  no  sufficient  condition  for  its  immunity  against  contagion. 
Microfinancial  supervision, 
to  be  supplemented  by 
macrofinancial  supervision.  Around  the  world,  central  banks  and  financial 
supervisors have taken this aspect seriously and have started to establish new 
supervisory authorities and strengthen the coordination of supervisory bodies, 
both at the national and the international level. 
therefore,  needs 
 The new European financial supervision architecture aims at strengthening the crisis 
resilience  of  banks  by  boosting  capitalization  and  improving  capital  quality.  A 
macroprudential supervisory framework for the early identification of systemic risks 
as  well  as  a  new  legal  framework  for  crisis  management  have  been  established. 
Within  the  European  System  of  Financial  Supervision  (ESFS),  the  European 
Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) was established as an institutionalized early warning 
system  for  financial  market  risk.  Three  new  supervisory  authorities  deal  with 
microprudential risks in banks, insurance companies and financial markets. Stress 
tests  indicate,  at  an  early  stage,  the  possible  recapitalization  needs  of  individual 
financial institutions.  
Similar initiatives are under way at the international level. At the end of 2010, the 
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision agreed on a new international regulatory 
framework for banks, known as Basel III. In the U.S.A., the Dodd-Frank act aims at 
improving  the  transparency  of  the  U.S.  financial  system  and  approaches  the 
“too-big-to-fail”  problem.  This  last  aspect  is  of  special  relevance  for  Austria’s 
neighboring country Switzerland.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches

     Central banks have not only played an essential role as lenders of last resort during 
the  crisis,  they  are  also  actively  involved  in  shaping  the  new  financial  supervisory 
architecture.  Since  2008,  the  Oesterreichische  Nationalbank  (OeNB)  shares  the 
responsibility  for  macroprudential  supervision  with  the  Austrian  Financial  Market 
Authority.  The  role  of  central  banks  in  this  area  has  changed  dramatically  over 
recent years. 
– 
This leads me to the third lesson: We need to redefine the financial stability 
scope of central banks. Should central banks – in addition to warranting price 
stability – be given a clear mandate to prevent asset bubbles? I see serious 
risks for potential goal conflicts if central banks were to pursue price stability 
and  asset  price  stability  goals  simultaneously.  I  am  confident  that  the 
Eurosystem’s  two-pillar  strategy,  which  supplements  the  short-  to  medium-
term  perspective  of  economic  analysis  by  longer-term  risk  analyses  derived 
from  monetary  and  credit  indicators,  is  an  adequate  tool  to  contribute  to 
ensuring financial stability. 
Strengthening national and international coordination and forward-looking policies is 
not only a challenge with a view to financial stability but more generally with regard 
to the interaction of economic policies. The readiness of governments worldwide to 
fight an exceptionally deep economic contraction with large fiscal stimulus packages 
was certainly a major reason why the recession was overcome so quickly. This swift 
return to positive – although moderate – growth was, in many cases, instrumental in 
avoiding  worse  and  self-reinforcing  negative  effects  on  structural  unemployment, 
consumer confidence and risk aversion.

 However,  this  strong  fiscal  reaction  also  came  at  high  costs.  Budget  deficits 
exploded  and  debt-to-GDP  ratios  reached  record  levels.  In  some  highly  indebted 
European  countries,  this  translated  into  a  veritable  debt  crisis.  Markets  that,  for 
years,  had  failed  to  adequately  price  fiscal  imbalances,  rediscovered  risks 
associated with high debt levels.  
When markets react late, they tend to overreact. Thus, bond spreads and the price 
for  credit  default  insurances  soared.  Rising  refinancing  costs  further  aggravated 
fiscal consolidation. As recourse to market funds is currently not possible, the highly 
indebted  countries  need  international  financial  assistance  to  tide  them  over  until 
fiscal consolidation starts to be effective and markets regain confidence. But even if 
markets will have stabilized, debt stabilization will require many years of substantial 
primary surpluses.

 The fourth lesson to be learned from the crisis is therefore that we need to 
improve fiscal policy frameworks. We need a long-term commitment to fiscal 
stabilization  at  the  national  level  and  effective  warning  and  supervisory 
mechanisms  at  the  European  level.  We  need  to  make  sure  that  –  once  the 
worst is over – good economic times are used for fiscal consolidation so that 
fiscal margins are there when the next recession approaches.  
An  exceptional  crisis  calls  for  exceptional  measures.  While  it  was  commonly 
accepted prior to 2008 that rules-based fiscal approaches and the free operation of 
automatic fiscal stabilizers are best suited for ensuring long-term sustainability, the 
severity of the recession and the high level of uncertainty has led to a renaissance 
of  fiscal  discretion.  Quick  and  determined  action  was  certainly  a  key  factor  in 
keeping  the  recession  short.  However,  long  implementation  lags  of  some  of  the 
anti-crisis measures and the inflexibility of budgeting processes are also at the origin 
of the strong deterioration of debt levels.

 A focus on the measures with the shortest implementation lags as well as a regular 
reassessment  of  the  adequacy  of  the  size  of  the  respective  fiscal  stimulus  might 
have saved substantial funds in several countries and put them in a better position 
to weather the next crisis. We need to get back to the rules-based fiscal system that 
for decades proved to be best suited for providing long-term stability.  
An  improved  fiscal  framework  and  well-functioning  supervisory  and  warning 
procedures in Europe are even more important as recent years have taught us that 
we  cannot  rely  on  financial  market  mechanisms  as  the  penalizing  factor  for  bad 
fiscal behavior. One week before Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, rating agencies 
still  rated  it  as  “investment  grade.”  Markets  responded  far  too  late  and  then 
overreacted. Currently, we are in a situation of self-fulfilling prophecies where major 
rating agencies can actually trigger a crisis just by announcing it.  
– 
The final lesson I should like to draw from the experience of these past years 
is  that  we  need  to  rethink  the  role  of  rating  agencies.  The  liberalization  of 
financial  markets,  which  enhanced  the  influence  of  commercial  ratings,  is 
irreversible.  Monetary  policy,  however,  needs  to  reduce  its  dependence  on 
assessments  made  by  rating  agencies.  In  that  respect,  the  approach  of  the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches
   6 
 U.S.  Federal  Reserve  might  be  a  good  example  for  Europe.  Furthermore, 
competition among rating agencies needs to be reinforced and supervised.  
It is up to politics to let the euro unfold its full benefits 
We  are  currently  back  in  a  situation  of  high  economic  uncertainty  and  mounting 
pressures  on  the  financial  markets.  In  view  of  a  sheer  endless  sequence  of 
emergency meetings and new crisis measures, some people are beginning to lose 
confidence in the common currency and in international policy cooperation. I would 
therefore  like  to  add  a  few  thoughts  on  the  global  role  of  the  common  European 
currency and on the benefits the euro offers to euro area citizens. 
In  the  first  years  after  the  introduction  of  the  euro,  the  citizens  of  the  euro  area 
profited from having a  common currency in many respects. In spite of a series of 
adverse  economic  shocks,  the  monetary  policy  of  the  Eurosystem  has  been 
effective in keeping both inflation and deflation at bay, thus securing the value of the 
euro. Measured in terms of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the 
euro area inflation rate was on average slightly below 2% between 1999 and 2010, 
which was in line with the Eurosystem’s definition of price stability. Thus, inflation in 
the  euro  area  countries  was  0.4  percentage  points  lower  than  in  the  seven  years 
before the introduction of the euro. 
As exchange rate fluctuations no longer existed within the euro area, trading costs 
declined not only between euro area countries but also between the euro area and 
its major trading partners. This promoted the exchange of goods and services and 
contributed to economic growth.  
The  euro  and  the  single  monetary  policy  of  the  euro  area  proved  to  be  a  shelter 
during the financial crisis. Rapid action and flexible provision of central bank liquidity 
secured  the  functioning  of  the  banking  sector  and  of  payment  systems  in  Europe 
even at the height of the financial market tensions. Moreover, years of strengthened 
economic policy coordination within the euro area facilitated joint action to safeguard 
the  stability  of  the  financial  system  and  to  reform  the  European  system  of 
supervision. After all, during financial storms it is better to be in a large ship than in a 
small vessel.  
The common currency does, however, not come without costs. Within a monetary 
union, where monetary and exchange rate policies are no longer the responsibility of 
national  governments,  a  high  level  of  coordination  between  fiscal  and  structural 
policies  and  a  forward-looking  approach  are  essential  to  ensure  that  national 
policies do not interfere with the common monetary policy.  
The interest rate decline in the countries at the periphery of the European Union was 
an important factor for their impressive catching-up process, but also the source of 
mounting internal and external imbalances. Unsustainable labor cost developments 
and  widening  external  deficits  are  clear  indicators  of  losses  in  competitiveness. 
Housing  price  booms  and  excessive  credit  growth  signal  asset  price  bubbles  that 
harbor  the  risk  of  sudden  trend  reversals.  At  the  European  level  we  can  support 
countries  by  giving  advice  and  –  if  necessary  –  by  executing  peer  pressure  and 
providing  incentives  for  adequate  policies.  We  also  continue  to  strengthen  the 
supervisory  powers  of  European  institutions  under  the  enhanced  Stability  and 
Growth Pact.  
Since the introduction of the euro, many economists have argued that any monetary 
union  faces  the  risk  that  the  economic  developments  of  some  of  its  members 
diverge, even if an adequate mix of national policy measures is applied. They have 
3.

      BIS central bankers’ speeches

called  for  some  form  of  transfer  or  fiscal  union  as  a  complement  to  common 
monetary  policy.  Some  have  argued  that  a  monetary  union  without  a  minimum  of 
fiscal  solidarity  cannot  persist.  At  the  beginning  of  Stage  Three  of  Economic  and 
Monetary Union, however, the political will to move in that direction was small.  
    8 
 The recent months have proved that the euro area countries are ready to show a 
substantial  level  of  solidarity  in  view  of  the  current  debt  crisis  of  some  Member 
States,  out  of  the  profound  conviction  that  only  the  health  of  each  individual  euro 
area country can ensure the health of the euro area as a whole – just like, at many 
stages  during  the  last  decades,  obstacles  had  the  potential  to  mobilize  political 
forces that moved the European integration process forward. 
Currently, Greece, Ireland and Portugal receive financial assistance from European 
countries and the IMF. This aid takes the form of guarantees and loans extended 
under  strict  conditionality.  To  support  these  three  countries  until  they  will  have 
regular access to market funds again, this aid was recently stepped up by stretching 
maturities,  reducing  interest  rates  and  providing  additional  funds.  In  the  case  of 
Greece, the package of support measures also involves a voluntary contribution of 
the  private  sector  –  an  important  factor  to  increase  risk  awareness  among 
institutional investors – as well as a debt buy-back program. To calm markets and 
ensure  the  smooth  functioning  of  the  transmission  channel,  the  Eurosystem 
reactivated its bond purchase program in mid-August.  
The  most  important  step  was  the  constitution  of  a  mechanism  to  deal  with  debt 
crises in EU Member States. The temporary institutions European Financial Stability 
Facility (EFSF) and European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) as well as 
the  permanent  institution  of  the  European  Stability  Mechanism  (ESM)  were 
subsequently endowed with additional funds and competences. Soon the EFSF will 
be able to buy bonds on the secondary market and contribute to the recapitalization 
of  financial  institutions.  It  will  have  a  clear  mandate  to  act  in  a  forward-looking 
manner to prevent crises.

        The solidarity, member countries have recently demonstrated, does, however, have 
clear limits. In the end, it will therefore be up to every single euro area country to 
draw  their  own  lessons  from  the  crisis  and  to  understand  that  the  benefits  of  the 
common currency can only be fully reaped if policies at the national level contribute 
to the European idea and goals. 
Multiple global fault lines require determined and coordinated action 
Overall, we are currently facing a highly precarious situation. Within an environment 
in which economic recovery proceeds at diverging speeds, all important economic 
regions struggle with specific challenges.  
In Europe, the debt crisis in some countries at the periphery of the EU threatens to 
spread  to  individual  core  economies.  Even  though  these  countries  share  certain 
vulnerabilities with the highly indebted countries, the extent of the financial market 
reaction is not justified by economic fundamentals and shows clear contagion signs. 
These  contagion  effects  require  solutions  at  the  euro  area  level  since  they  may 
endanger the stability of the common currency. 
Deficit  and  debt  levels  are  also  mounting  in  the  U.S.A.  To  a  certain  extent,  its 
special role as an international reserve currency shields the U.S. dollar. But hesitant 
recovery  and  the  recent  downgrading  by  a  major  rating  agency  point  toward 
emerging market tensions. 
Japan  has,  to  a  large  extent,  overcome  the  damages  of  the  catastrophic 
earthquake. Production lines are mostly operating smoothly and reconstruction is in 
progress.  The  high  fraction  of  domestically  held  bonds  and  the  low  interest  rates 
facilitate  the  roll-over  of  Japan’s  record-high  debt  levels  of  around  200%  of  GDP. 
But  in  the  light  of  projected  further  debt  increases  and  the  country’s  recent  debt 
downgrading, the sustainability of public finances should not be taken for granted. 
The strength of the Japanese yen dampens growth prospects. 
The large capital inflows into emerging markets entail risks of blowing up asset and 
housing price bubbles and increasing inflation. Given the international origin of these 
capital flows, national policies have very limited possibilities of counteraction. 
I am confident that decision-makers – governments, central banks and international 
institutions  –  will  find  appropriate  solutions  for  every  individual  case  at  hand. 
However,  the  danger  of  these  multiple  fault  lines  is  not  only  their  number  and 
severity but also their interconnectedness. As the current situation in Europe shows, 
increasing market concerns about debt sustainability may quickly spread from one 
country to another. Just like in 2008, liquidity shortages in industrial countries may 
force investors to withdraw funds from emerging markets that initially appeared to be 
decoupled from financial market tensions. 
These global linkages call for enhanced international cooperation. But – to remain 
realistic – this has its limits. I rather expect the dynamics of global peer pressure and 
the high current problem awareness among the population to have the potential of 
opening a window of opportunity for far-reaching reforms. 
I  see  several  options  of  how  small  countries  can  increase  the  crisis  resistance  of 
their economies and improve their political safety net. 
A  first  option  is  to  join  a  larger  economic  or  monetary  entity.  The  global  financial 
crisis  has  shown  that  world  currencies  have  been  largely  spared  from  sudden 
exchange rate fluctuations. The central banks of large economic areas are, in fact, 
unlimited in their ability to provide liquidity and act as a lender of last resort. They 
can furthermore count on the assistance of other major central banks.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches

   For small countries within the euro area, the sheltering function of the euro adds to 
the  other  benefits  of  the  common  currency.  By  contrast,  in  recent  years  countries 
with an autonomous monetary policy such as Iceland and Switzerland experienced 
the negative aspects of monetary autonomy.  
A  second  option  –  which  is  rather  a  supplement  to  than  a  substitute  of  the  first 
approach  –  is  to  implement  reforms  and  follow  policies  aimed  at  reducing  the 
vulnerabilities  of  the  economy.  These  vulnerabilities  include  fiscal  and  external 
imbalances,  unsustainable  health  and  pension  systems  and  marked  social 
inequalities. A high level of fiscal indebtedness always implies a large exposure to 
financial market assessments. An efficient supervision of the monetary and banking 
system  –  take  the  Irish  achievements  as  a  role  model  –  has  the  potential  of 
detecting mounting imbalances early and of providing enough leeway to implement 
the necessary. 
Overall, most countries around the world currently face similar challenges and have 
limited room for maneuver. But it pays to fight for the achievements of past decades 
and it makes sense to take the crisis as a chance for reform.
