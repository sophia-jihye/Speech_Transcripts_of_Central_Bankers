V K Sharma: Identifying systemic risk in global markets – lessons 
learned from the crisis 
Address by Mr V K Sharma, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 2nd Pan 
Asian  Regulatory  Summit  –  Identifying  Systemic  Risk  in  Global  Markets  Lessons  learned 
from the crisis: Asian regulators’ views on what have they done to contain the building up of 
systemic risk and to prevent the recurrence of future crisis – organised by Thomson Reuters, 
Singapore, 28–29 September, 2011. 
 The views expressed are those of the author and not of the Reserve Bank of India 
 
In my considered opinion, systemic risks in the global markets can be best identified 
and measured by looking at some select key parameters which, between them, indicate the 
extent of asset bubbles and the corresponding under-pricing of risks. In other words, it is not 
so much high volatility, which is the “effect”, that should be a cause for concern as persistent 
and  excessively  low  volatility,  which  is  the  “cause”,  and  was  the  hallmark  of  the  pre-crisis 
period.  In  particular,  it  is  very  instructive  to  look  at  the  readings  on  parameters  such  as 
(i) TED Spread (3M LIBOR – 3M Treasury Bill), (ii) 3M LIBOR – 3M OIS, (iii) 3M LIBOR – 
Effective Fed Funds Rate, (iv) VIX Index and (v) CDX Crossover index. Pre-crisis these were 
about 48 bps, 12 bps, 27 bps, 24% and 154, respectively. This was the time when there was 
a veritable bubble across credit and equity markets and global policy makers were already 
warning  about  huge  under-pricing  of  risks  in  the  run  up  to  the  crisis.  But  unfortunately, 
nothing,  in  terms  of  pre-emptive,  proactive  and  credible  policy  response,  other  than  these 
warnings,  was  delivered.  If  one  looks  at  the  recent  readings  (from  September  2010  to 
July 2011)  on  these  five  parameters,  on  parameter  No.  (i)  at  13  bps,  we  were  at  almost 
quarter the level, on parameter No. (ii) at 9 bps, we were  almost there, on parameter No. 
(iii) at 11 bps, we were less than half, on parameter No. (iv) at 14.62% we were roughly at 
half  and  on  parameter  No.  (v)  at  146,  we  were  at  slightly  lower  level.  There  is  thus 
incontrovertible evidence that there is yet again a huge under-pricing of risks in the financial 
system and, therefore, it is not a question of if, but when, generic asset bubble caused by 
manifold  increases  in  balance  sheets  of  central  banks  will  burst.  Specifically,  currently  the 
global liquidity has become a bigger concern than it was in pre-2007 period what with ultra-
low and near-zero policy rates and major central banks’ balance sheets 1.50 to 3 times their 
pre-2007 levels, adding about USD 4 trillion in incremental central bank liquidity. Worse, US 
banks are reportedly keeping excess reserves of US $ 1.5 trillion with the Fed rather than 
lend  to  small  businesses  and  households.  Alongside,  non-financial  corporations  in  the  US 
are reportedly sitting on cash and liquid assets worth USD 2 trillion which they do not know 
what  to  do  with  it!  In  this  background  of  huge  deluge  of  global  liquidity,  there  are 
unmistakable  signs  of  asset  bubble  inflating  again  in  almost  a  replay  of  the  last  global 
financial crisis. As the table I shows, as of  14 September 2011, the over-valuation of gold  
– what we can also call gold bubble – with reference to 7 competing asset classes varied 
from 84% against highly correlated metal prices proxied by LMEX, 90% against WTI crude, 
123% against US Treasuries proxied by JP Morgan index, and roughly 250–300% against 
Credit  Default  Swap  index,  Dow  Jones,  the  US  dollar  index  DXY  and  the  US  home  price 
Case-Shiller index. (To detect an asset bubble (gold in the present case), fair value/price of 
gold with reference to competing asset classes like US dollar, US stock market, crude oil, the 
US treasuries, credit risk, base metals, and US house prices, proxied, respectively, by the 
DXY 
(Euro,  Pound  Sterling,  Japanese  Yen,  Swiss  Franc,  Canadian  Dollar  and 
Swedish Krona),  the  Dow  Jones  Industrial  Average  (DJIA),  WTI  spot,  J.P.  Morgan  Bond 
Index,  CDX  IG,  a  CDS  Index  for  Investment  Grade  US  bonds,  London  Metal  Exchange 
(LMEX) (nickel, tin, aluminium, copper, zinc and lead) and S&P CASE-SHILLER index, has 
been  computed.  The  Table  I  is  self-explicit.  This  intuitively  appealing  methodology  of 
computing fair value is reasonably robust and rigorous based as it is on the assumption that

In  fact,  in  my  speech  “Genesis,  Diagnosis  and  Prognosis  of  the  Current  Global 
Financial  Crisis”,  published  in  BIS  Review  34/2009,  I  had  mentioned  that  there  was 
significant  risk  that  the  then  monetary  policy  environment  of  very  low  interest  rates  and 
unprecedented  deluge  of  liquidity  may  yet  again  engender  another  bubble  in  the  not  too 
distant future! Indeed, we almost had a commodity bubble which, to all intents and purposes, 
was  caused  by  this  very  huge  deluge  of  liquidity  but  burst  due  to  the  enveloping  global 
economic  downturn,  in  general,  and  countercyclical  measure  of  NYMEX  raising  cash 
margins  on  crude  oil  futures  and  CFTC  checking  speculative  positions,  in  particular. 
Perhaps, if this swamp of liquidity and monetary easing are not unwound appropriately, and 
in  an  orderly,  and  timely  manner,  the  next  crisis  might  well  be  a  veritable  “financial  and 
economic nuclear winter”! Thus, you will see that we almost had a bubble which burst and 
now  we  are  heading  towards  another  one,  shades  of  which,  contextually,  we  experienced 
recently on August 4, 2011, and post FOMC meeting on September 20, 2011, when almost 
in prophetic confirmation of my prognostication, based on  the aforesaid analysis, crude oil 
and global stock markets slumped by around 5% and gold slumped to $ 1530 per troy ounce 
on Chicago Mercantile Exchange raising cash margins on gold futures by 20%!  
 
As  regards  mitigation  of  the  building  up  of  such  systemic  risks,  the  answer  is 
addressing  the  “cause”  and  which  is  again  there  in  my  same  speech.  At  the  risk  of  being 
repetitive,  it  must  be  noted  that  even  if  global  imbalances  and  accommodative  monetary 
policy provided an enabling environment for excessive leverage and risk taking, it was still 
the responsibility of regulators and supervisors to have taken appropriate macro-prudential 
measures, pre-emptively, decisively and proactively, rather than reactively. But unfortunately 
broad spectrum and generic regulatory and supervisory failure worldwide, especially in the 
West,  precipitated  the  unprecedented  global  financial  crisis.  The  most  no-holds-barred 
acknowledgement of this, though it came much later only recently, was when Donald Kohn, 
former Vice Chairman of the US Federal Reserve apologized by saying, “The cops were not 
on  the  beat,  resulting  in  the  worst  economic  recession  and  loss  of  millions  of  jobs.”  This 
regulatory  and  supervisory  inertia  to  unprecedented  build  up  of  risk  globally,  typical  and 
characteristic, of the hunky-dory and gung-ho financial environment of the pre-crisis days, is 
most graphically epitomized by what Mark Twain said 100 years ago: “It ain’t what you don’t 
know that gets you into trouble; it is what you know for sure that just ain’t so!”  
 
As is invariably the case with any major crisis, the global financial crisis has unleashed 
a passionate debate over the design of a new global financial and regulatory architecture. 
However, the trouble has been not so much with the existing, inter-temporally evolved, global 
financial regulatory architecture as really with how it was actually worked in practice. Huge 
losses  at  global  banks  running  to  about  USD  2  trillion  were  not  because  existing  best 
practices,  risk  management  and  internal  controls  failed  but  because  those  responsible  for 
implementing, and enforcing them, failed them! From 1990s to 2011 and from Nick Leeson of 
Baring  Brothers  to  Hamanaka  of  Sumitomo  Corporation  to  Kerviel  of  Societe  Generale  to 
Adoboli of UBS AG, the underlying story has remained just the same! After all, of all risks to 
regulators and regulatees alike, human resources risk is by far the most serious as it is the 
source of all risks as confirmed by the recent financial cataclysm. The crux of the matter is 
what  we  need  is  not  more  or  less  regulation  and  governance  but  good  regulation  and 
governance  which  simply  means  actually  doing  what  must  be  done!  This  has  been  the 
undoing of both regulators/supervisors and financial firms/banks alike. In the way of example, 
in the USA, the traditionally very healthy AAA rated AIG and mono-line bond insurers MBIA 
and  Ambac  changed  their  business  model  from  insuring  only  their  staple  products  and 
strayed  into  insuring  CDOs  and  ABS  and  writing  CDS.  While  this  went  unnoticed  by 
insurance  regulators,  Pershing  Square,  a  hedge  fund,  spotted  trouble and  started shorting 
both equity and credit risk of these two companies. But even after this, regulators failed to 
take  notice  and  corrective  action  with  the  two  companies  being  eventually  downgraded 
2 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches
Specifically,  regulators/policy-makers  need 
several notches and AIG having to be bailed out by the Fed and US government. The same 
is true of financial firms and banks where independent directors on the boards, much less 
ask right questions, apparently didn’t even understand the arcane world of modern finance 
and banking and according to a column in the Financial Times, after the crisis, one leading 
global bank ran an advertisement inviting applications for board positions from experienced 
professional bankers! Besides, rather than take timely notice of, and act on, early warning 
signals  coming  from  financial  markets,  like  stock  and  CDSs  markets,  regulators  chose 
instead  to  shut  themselves  to  these  early  warning  signals  themselves  by  banning  short 
selling  which  act  effectively  amounted  to  shooting  the  messenger  for  the  unpalatable 
message it had to convey!  
 
Another development that portends build-up of systemic risk is a rather rapid growth of 
ETFs with USD 1.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM) which has close parallels, in 
terms of complexity and opacity, with the CDO market, including its “squared” and “cubed” 
variants.  Financial  Stability  Board  and  Financial  Services  Authority  have  already  raised 
concerns  what  with  emergence  of  synthetic  ETFs,  inverse,  or  short,  ETFs  and  leveraged 
ETFs. In particular, there are concerns with synthetic ETFs which depend upon a swap with 
parent bank to track return of an index against collaterals which considerably deviate from 
the index being tracked. This gives rise to the possibility that banks may be using ETFs to 
finance their riskier and illiquid assets cheaply than they would be able to do in a standard 
repo market. The synthetic ETFs also introduce counter-party risk not present in plain vanilla 
ETFs.  However,  that  leaves  out  the  non-ETF  financialized  commodities  as  a  significant 
component  of  the  total  global  financial  assets  worth  US $ 242 trillion  (banking  assets: 
$ 104 trillion,  equity:  US $ 47 trillion  and  bonds:  US $ 91 trillion),  of  which  there  is  no 
estimate  in  the  Global  Financial  Stability  Report  of  IMF;  above-ground  gold  itself  is  worth 
about US $ 10 trillion at current prices! 
 
to  deliver  counter-cyclical  prudential 
measures  like  selectively  increasing  capital  charge  for  riskier  categories  of  assets  by 
increasing  risk  weights  for  asset  classes  where  bubbles  exist,  or  are  in  the  process  of 
building.  In  addition,  they  need  to  be  complemented  by  fixing  the  maximum  absolute 
leverage  (not  allowing  for  risk  weights  for  assets)  in  addition  to  risk  weighted  asset-based 
capital  prescription.  These  regulatory  measures  obviate  the  need  of  monetary  policy 
tightening which is a blunt tool indiscriminately affecting all sectors of the financial markets 
and the real economy. Besides, significantly, the credit crisis has also thrown into sharp relief 
a  “strong  connect”  between  “liquidity  risk”  and  “opaque  off-balance  sheet  exposures”  of 
whatever  description.  The  appropriate  supervisory  and  regulatory  response  to  these  risks 
would,  therefore,  be  to  insist  on  full  disclosure  and  transparency  of  off-balance  sheet 
commitments / exposures and supervisory insistence on an appropriate mix of “stored” and 
“purchased”  liquidity  and  appropriate  capital  charge  for  liquidity  risk;  the  higher  the 
“purchased  liquidity”  component,  the  higher  the  capital  charge  and  the  higher  the  “stored 
liquidity” component, the lower the capital charge. Thus, banking supervisors and regulators 
need to be more hands-on and pro-active in focusing supervisory attention on this critical risk 
category than has been the case so far. (In fact, in India the Committee on Financial Sector 
Assessment almost presciently focused on this critical risk in the month of May itself, much 
before the liquidity and credit crunch of August 2007).  
 
In  refreshing  contrast,  in  India,  we  have  had  remarkable  financial  stability,  not 
fortuitously, but thanks to pre-emptively and pro-actively delivered prudential measures like 
increase  in  risk  weights  for  exposures  to  commercial  real  estate,  capital  market,  venture 
capital  funds  and  systemically  important  non-deposit  accepting  Non  Banking  Finance 
Companies  (NBFCs).  These  pre-crisis  prudential  regulatory  measures  of  Reserve  Bank  of 
India  represented  what  now  are  famously  known  as  “countercyclical  prudential  measures” 
and  have  been  strongly  commended  for  adoption  by  various  recent  Working  Groups  / 
Committees of international regulators. Indeed, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis 
and  resulting  economic  recession,  these  counter  cyclical  prudential  measures  were  rolled

back to cushion the adverse impact of the crisis to considerable beneficial effect to the Indian 
economy.  Significantly,  recently  again,  to  contain  potential  systemic  liquidity  risk,  the 
Reserve Bank has capped banks’ investments in Fixed Income Mutual Funds to 10% of their 
net worth.
