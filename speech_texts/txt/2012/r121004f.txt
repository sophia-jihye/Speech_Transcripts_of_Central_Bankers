Gill Marcus: Crisis and confidence 
Address by Gill Marcus, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, to the Nordic Business 
Chamber of South Africa, Johannesburg, 2 October 2012. 
 Good afternoon, and thank you for the invitation to address you today.  
As you know, on the 20th of September we made our latest interest rate decision. As with all of 
our deliberations on the Monetary Policy Committee, this decision to keep rates at the current 
level was not an easy one. The global economy remains a source of extreme uncertainty, while 
the domestic economy is beset by its own challenges – some related to the travails of the rest 
of the world and others home-grown. I thought it might be useful to speak today about current 
economic conditions and our latest interest rate decision, before moving on to say a few words 
about rebuilding confidence in our economic future.  
Crisis  
The global growth  outlook  has  weakened  in recent months,  despite  some moderation  in  the 
risks  surrounding  Europe’s  financial  situation.  The  European  Central  Bank,  the  Federal 
Reserve  and  the  Bank  of  Japan  have  launched  new  programmes  to  add  liquidity  to  key 
markets and to encourage economic growth.  
The  QE3  decision  by  Chairman  Bernanke  and  the  FOMC  seeks  to  improve  outcomes  in  a 
US labour market struggling with slow growth. But the economic outlook going forward is weak, 
clouded over by the risk that the US will walk over a “fiscal cliff” of combined tax increases and 
spending cuts, causing a sharp slowing in US growth. Despite renewed stimulus in the United 
States  and  agreement  to  continue  funding  the  government  until  March  2013,  growth  is 
expected to remain subdued at least until the “fiscal cliff” issue is resolved.1  
In  the  Eurozone,  the  immediate  risks  posed  by  the  continuing  debt  crisis  appear  to  have 
abated somewhat. The ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme, the decision 
of the federal constitutional court in Germany to uphold the ratification of the treaty to establish 
the European Stability Mechanism, and the pro-euro outcome of the Dutch election have lent 
some  stability  to  the  zone.  Nonetheless  the risk  of  a Greek  exit from the  Eurozone  remains 
high, and growth prospects in the region have deteriorated as banks deleverage further and 
cross-border lending falls.  
Growth  has  also  slowed  in  some  of the  systemically  important  emerging market  economies, 
particularly in China, Brazil and India.  
In line with weaker growth worldwide, global inflation remains relatively benign. And yet supply 
side shocks in the form of higher food prices, due to droughts in the US and some parts of 
Eastern Europe, and resilient international crude oil prices pose potentially serious risks to the 
outlook. The combination of slowing growth and rising prices presents difficult challenges for 
monetary policy.  
Global  conditions  impact  on  South  Africa,  and  this,  alongside  domestic  factors,  has  been 
reflected  in  our  own  downward  revisions  to  the  forecast  for  domestic  economic  growth.  For 
2012 we expect the economy to grow by about 2.6 per cent, rising to 3.4 per cent in 2013 as 
the global economy starts to recover.  
The economy grew by 3.2 per cent in the second quarter of 2012, but this reflects a distortion 
arising  from  the  strong  contribution  from  the  mining  sector  which  recovered  from  a  deep 
contraction in the first quarter. Non-mining real output growth measured a low 1.7 per cent. 
                                                
1  The  US  Congress  passed  a  “continuing  resolution”  which  authorizes  funding  of  the  US  government  through 
March 2013 at current spending levels. This provides room for discussion about the scheduling of withdrawal of 
tax  cuts  and  enactment  of  spending  cuts  over  the  next  few  months  without  the  risk  of  needing  to  address  a 
government shutdown. It does not remove the fiscal cliff. 
Household  spending  continues  to  provide  much  of  the  growth  in  the  economy.  Investment 
strengthened  in  the  latter  half  of  2011  and  growth  has  been  sustained  into  2012,  rising  by 
5.7 per  cent  in  the  second  quarter  of  this  year.  However,  private  sector  gross  fixed  capital 
formation  remains  weak,  with  the  balance  of  growth  in  investment  arising  from  activities  of 
public corporations.  
Job  creation  has  picked  up,  but  again  remains  sluggish.  Statistics  South  Africa  shows 
123,000 jobs created from mid-year 2011 to mid-year 2012, about one third of which were in 
the public sector. The current level of formal sector employment is still about 60,000 less than 
that reached before the onset of the crisis.  
The  stronger  growth  in  the  domestic  economy  that  we  saw  in  the  first  half  of  2012  was 
reflected in better credit extension figures. These have since moderated from 9.2 per cent in 
March, to 7.3 per cent and 7,8 per cent in July and August respectively. Credit extension to 
households rose by 8.1 per cent in July and 9,0 per cent in August, while credit extended to the 
corporate sector eased somewhat. Mortgage loans remained subdued, while instalment sale 
credit and leasing finance reflect robust vehicle sales. Unsecured lending has continued to rise 
rapidly, although again somewhat slower in recent months than in the first quarter of this year.  
Partly  as  a  result  of  this  lending,  household  debt  as  a  ratio  to  disposable  income  increased 
slightly, from 75.6 per cent to 76.3 per cent between the first and second quarters of 2012. The 
asset  quality  of  the  banking  sector  however  remains  sound.  Impaired  advances  as  a 
percentage of gross loans and advances measured 4.4 per cent in July 2012 compared with 
5.5 per cent a year earlier.  
The  trends  in  wage  growth  have  been  relatively  benign  from  an  inflation  perspective,  with 
nominal  unit  labour  cost  growth  of  6.1  per  cent  in  the  first  half  of  2012  compared  to  a  year 
earlier. However, there is a risk that the recent wage settlements in the mining sector could set 
a precedent for wage demands more generally.  
We expect consumer prices in South Africa to remain contained within the target range over 
the forecast period. The decline in inflation in recent months to 4.9 per cent in July appears to 
have stopped with the August outcome of 5.0 per cent.  
Food  and  petrol  prices  continue  to  be  the  main  drivers  of  consumer  prices,  set  largely  in 
international  markets  and  then  feeding  through  into  South  Africa.  Food  prices  increased  by 
5.1 per cent, petrol by 9.3 per cent and electricity by 10.0 per cent in the year to August. Core 
inflation,  as  measured  by  the  exclusion  of  food,  petrol  and  electricity  from  CPI  measured 
4.6 per cent, up from 4.5 per cent in July. Administered prices excluding petrol increased at a 
year-on-year rate of 7.5 per cent.  
The inflation forecast of the Bank reflects a moderate deterioration for 2013 compared with the 
previous forecast, and a relatively flat trajectory over the entire forecast period. Inflation is now 
expected  to  average  5.3  per  cent  in the final  quarter  of  2012  and  5.6  per  cent for the  year, 
5.2 per cent in 2013, and 5.0 per cent in 2014. Inflation expectations continue to be roughly in 
line  with  the  Bank’s  forecast,  although  anchored  near  the  upper  end  of  the  3  to  6  per  cent 
target range.  
The rand exchange rate has fluctuated generally within a range of R8.10 and R8.50 against the 
US  dollar  since  May,  and  continues  to  be  affected  by  changing  risk  perceptions  in  global 
financial markets and domestic issues, such as the tragic events at Marikana.  
Capital flows into South Africa remain robust this year, rising by a net R72.5 billion. Investor 
interest  in  emerging  market  debt  and  South  Africa’s  inclusion  in  the  Citibank  World 
Government Bond Index (WGBI) have contributed to the inflows. In recent months, the rand 
depreciated  against  the  euro  by  about  7.5  per  cent  and  about  2.4  per  cent  against  the 
US dollar.  
The current account of the balance of payments has emerged as a risk to the exchange rate 
outlook following the widening of the deficit to 6.4 per cent of GDP in the second quarter. This 
widening deficit is a consequence of declining commodity exports and increased imports and 
service  payments. We  expect  the  current  account  for  2012  to  moderate  somewhat  to  about 
5¼ per cent of GDP.  
Food and petrol prices continue to be the main upside risks to the inflation outlook. Following a 
sharp  spike  in  July,  global  grain  prices  appear  to  have  stabilised  and  then  moderated 
somewhat.  Domestic  prices  of  maize  and  wheat  have  followed  global  trends,  increasing  by 
about 40 per cent and 20 per cent respectively between the beginning of June and the end of 
July. These increases are expected to filter through to domestic consumer prices in the coming 
months.  
Following sharp decreases in petrol prices earlier this year, since August, the price of petrol 
has increased by a cumulative R1.15 per litre. A further increase is expected in October. These 
petrol price increases are driven by international oil prices, which reached US$117 per barrel 
on 14 September.2  
Oil prices have moderated in recent days to US$110 per barrel as Saudi Arabia committed to 
increase the supply of oil, but geo-political factors will remain a source of underlying volatility in 
the oil price.  
Creating confidence  
With this backdrop in mind, let me turn now to say a few things about how we might think about 
steps to improve confidence in South Africa and the region.  
As some of you will know, we participate in many international forums, the G20, the governors’ 
board  of  the  IMF,  the  Financial  Stability  Board  in  Basel  and  the  Bank  for  International 
Settlements, among others. Participation enables us to give voice to our concerns about the 
trajectory of the world economy, make suggestions on how to approach or resolve problems, 
and influence the development of regulatory frameworks that affect us. And yet, there is little or 
nothing we can do, other than express our views, to help other countries find their way out of 
the difficult prevailing economic circumstances.  
The  spill  over  of  global  factors  to  our  economy  can  be  profound,  changing  the  size  and 
direction of capital flows, global inflation, trade, commodity prices, and more.  
This means that as South Africans, we need to develop the policy and regulatory frameworks, 
and adjust our policy stance, to do as much as we can to offset harmful economic effects from 
abroad  while  taking  advantage  of  the  beneficial  dynamics.  Above  all,  it  means  encouraging 
local  economic  growth  and  development,  including  the  development  of  an  active,  integrated 
regional economy.  
Our  basic  macroeconomic  policy  framework  cushions  against  global  economic  shocks.  It 
allows for flexibility in our approach to achieving the inflation target. The Reserve Bank has the 
responsibility and the latitude to identify and understand shocks to consumer prices as being 
temporary  or  permanent,  and  to  view  inflation  pressures  alongside  economic  conditions  and 
developments in key markets. The gap between the economy’s potential growth rate, which is 
currently  3,5  per  cent,  and  its  actual  growth  performance  is  an  important  factor  in 
understanding the domestic economy. South Africa’s economic stability is further supported by 
a  macroprudential  framework  that  has  adjustable  limits  to  the  foreign  currency  exposure  of 
South African households and institutions.  
The  inflation  targeting  framework  allows  the  exchange  rate  to  be  determined  more  fully  by 
market  forces  than  under  a  policy  framework  that  tries  to  fix  the  currency.  This  has  various 
advantages, with perhaps the key one being that movements in the currency help to moderate 
the  very  forces  causing  the  currency’s  value  to  move.  When  the  currency  depreciates, 
moreover,  the  costs  to  some  economic  agents  are  balanced  by  gains  to  other  agents,  like 
exporters. This in turn reduces the cost of international contagion to the domestic economy.  
This is a lesson learned well in some Nordic economies. Exchange rate flexibility has critical 
macroeconomic  advantages for  small  open  economies  that  either  have diversified  trade  and 
financial  connections  to  other  economies  and  regions,  or  that  desire  some  autonomy  to 
determine their own monetary policy. Sweden and Norway, for instance, have extensive trade 
ties with the Eurozone but also with North America and Russia. Economies much more closely 
integrated with larger dominant economies may find fixed exchange rates a more useful way of 
maximizing the economic gains of their relationship to the main trading partner.  
                                                
2  Or USD$12 per barrel higher than at the time of the July MPC. 
The  floating  currency  and  independent  monetary  policy  become  especially  beneficial  for 
economies that need to adjust to negative economic shocks – both self-imposed and external. 
Sweden discovered this as it adjusted to a severe balance of payments crisis in the period after 
1991.3 It enabled Swedish banks and industry to restructure at a more favourable exchange 
rate and allowed the economy to achieve a more sustainable long-run growth path. The current 
global  crisis  provides  further  support  to  this  notion.  Sweden’s  growth  rate  rebounded 
post-crisis,  but  should  be  roughly  in  line  with  its  average  over  the  previous  decade  as  the 
global economy recovers in coming years.  
In  South  Africa’s  case,  the  floating  currency  supported  economic  growth  in  the  wake  of  the 
Argentine crisis of 2001, and in the current crisis the economy suffered a quite modest decline 
in the economy of 1.7% in 2009. Other factors also played an important role in supporting the 
economy in this period, including counter-cyclical fiscal policy and sustained high commodity 
prices.  
Real currency depreciation is, however, only one part of what it takes for economies to weather 
adverse shocks or to counter domestic economic developments that weaken competitiveness. 
Achieving a new sustainable economic growth rate after a shock or internal adversity requires 
economic adjustment – changes in rates of return to different economic activities and shifts in 
labour and capital between those activities. Adjustment should be easier to achieve when an 
economy is reasonably diversified. For South Africa, large commodity, manufacturing, financial 
and services sectors helps to keep the economy going even when one or more of them runs 
into trouble.  
This economic diversification is also critical to thinking about where to get the financial means 
to assist the economic adjustment process. And here an important idea comes from Norway, 
with which South Africa shares a commonality in a strong natural resource base. The idea is to 
shepherd natural resource earnings and use it for long term, inter-generational, development. 
There  are  various  ways  this  use  of  resource  rents  can  be  channelled  into  higher  welfare, 
through  direct  transfers  of  income  to  households,  stronger  communitarian  claims  on  private 
sector firms involved in extraction, or through more highly developed public services.  
But achieving anything via these channels depends on some ground rules being set out and 
protected in policy, regulation and/or law. One ground rule is the approach taken by the fiscal 
authorities to set the taxation of the resource rent at a level commensurate with sustainable 
long-term extraction and the life of the endowment. Another ground rule is how to manage the 
pay out of the revenues accruing from the resource. The benefit to citizens needs to spread 
over generations, rather than consumed up-front. This implies that public borrowing needs to 
be carefully managed to ensure that future resource revenues are not committed in advance to 
debt  repayment.  A  focus  on  long-run  infrastructure  development  by  the  public  finance 
authorities could help to ensure that additional borrowing pays back the debt without reducing 
the benefit of future resource revenues for future generations.  
Once all that is in place, how do we benefit from the resource endowment? Clearly there are 
various options, with spending to enhance the potential growth rate of the economy the most 
important.  But  where  should  we  focus  such  efforts? In my  view,  the  greatest gains  over  the 
longest  period  of  time  are  likely  to  come  out  of  efforts  to  develop  a  well-integrated  regional 
economy, founded on real economy links of trade, transport, telecommunications, energy, and 
labour mobility. These are the fundamentals that enable talent to find opportunity and firms to 
grow.  
This kind of focus is a far cry from the integration vogue of the last 20 years, which emphasised 
the  integrating-effects  of  common  monetary  systems.  Greater  regional  economic  integration 
should not be founded on common monetary arrangements. Sweden implicitly recognized that 
it  was  not  feasible  to  be  part  of  a  European  economic  arrangement  that  approximated  an 
optimal  currency  area.  And,  that  after  monetary  union,  it  was  unlikely  that  the  common 
                                                
3 
In 1991, Sweden’s economy contracted by –1.0%, in 1992 by –1.2, and in 1993 by over –2%. For the remainder 
of  the  1990s  it  grew  by  an  average  of  nearly  4%  per  year.  The  average  annual growth  rate  slowed  to  about 
2.75% in the 2000s, prior to the crisis. Annual growth rates were –0.61, –5.0, +6.1, and +3.9 from 2008 through 
2011. Finland had a much larger fall in 2009 (–8.3%), while Norway’s was comparable to SA at –1.7%. 
currency would generate the optimal currency area conditions. This was prescient of course as 
the Eurozone’s present circumstances show.  
In the Southern African Development Community a set of ambitious programmes were drawn 
up  and  agreed  about  10  years  ago,  including  moving  to  the  Africa-wide  monetary 
arrangements  (agreed  by  the  African  Union),  a  Regional  Indicative  Strategic  Development 
Plan,  and  a  macroeconomic  convergence  framework.  The  macroeconomic  convergence 
framework deliberately eschewed formal mechanisms for forcing convergence on the grounds 
that asymmetric shocks to regional economies would dominate and more formal arrangements 
would  lack  credibility.  Without  considering  optimal  currency  area  criteria,  a  convergence 
programme needed to be more of a peer review mechanism where policy dialogue and sharing 
of ideas could occur rather than an exercise in grilling wayward economic officials.  
As a peer review mechanism, the convergence programme should generate some benefits to 
SADC  members.  At  the  same  time,  however,  African monetary  integration  initiatives  are  still 
going ahead in various forums, for example initiatives by SADC and the AU, with different and 
overlapping timetables, and with inordinate haste in some instances. Unfortunately the thinking 
behind these initiatives continues to ignore the criteria for optimal currency areas.  
An important lesson of the European crisis is that macroeconomic convergence is not enough. 
Fiscal  conditions  need  to  be  supporting  of  macroeconomic  convergence  and  of  monetary 
arrangements, and institutions built to ensure that fiscal policy sustains those conditions over 
time.  While  the  need  for  harmonised  fiscal  policies  was  recognised  by  the  architects  of  the 
Eurozone, the issue was dealt with through the Stability and Growth Pact, which has turned out 
to  be  a  loose,  often  ignored  and  unenforceable  agreement  that  countries  would  abide  by 
certain  fiscal  guidelines.  We  have  seen  the  implications  of  the  lack  of  a  centralised  fiscal 
authority,  or  fiscal  counterpart  to  the  ECB.  Reaching  agreement  on,  and  implementing 
monetary policy is difficult enough. Fiscal policy is far more complex and political, as it involves 
policy levers that have more pervasive distributional impacts.  
At  the  end  of  the  day,  the  hard  work  of  developing  markets,  laying  out  infrastructure,  and 
enabling the flow of factors of production will develop our regional economy more effectively 
than any monetary arrangement or international institution to enforce sound fiscal policy. Such 
economic  integration  initiatives  can  be  supported  by  a  sustainable  and  far-sighted  resource 
revenue policy. 
Efforts to develop the regional economy need greater impetus. It is not hard to see why. South 
Africa’s  long-standing  economic  ties  to  Europe  and  North  America,  important  as  they  are, 
made it vulnerable to the collapse of these economies.  
African  economies  have  displayed  remarkable  resilience  during  the  crisis.  Although  most 
countries  experienced  lower  growth,  mainly  a  result  of  lower  global  commodity  prices,  in 
general  they  managed  to  avoid  recession.  Unlike  South  Africa,  the  trade  channel  was  less 
important because of the predominance of intraregional trade, and the stronger trade links with 
Asia. Since then, most sub-Saharan African countries have returned pre-crisis growth rates, in 
line with those in developing Asia.  
Africa  is  the  second-fastest growing  region  in  the  world,  and  this  looks  likely  to  continue for 
some time. Foreign direct investment into Africa remains quite high, at USD$42.7 billion last 
year. This is lower than at its peak of USD$57.8 billion in 2008 but still robust, and reflects a 
fall-off in investment to parts of North Africa. For Sub-Saharan Africa, FDI declined from the 
USD$34.7  billion  achieved  in  2008  to  USD$27  billion  in  2010  and  then  rebounded  to 
USD$35 billion  in  2011.  The  rebound  was  caused  by  large  inflows  to  South  Africa 
(USD$5.8 billion) and Nigeria (USD$8.9 billion).4 Direct investment into Africa will continue to 
grow  as  oil  and  gas  exploration  continues  to  expand  known  reserves  and  markets  for 
telecommunications and other services are opened to competition.  
Our goal  should  be  to  expand  trade  broadly  but  not  in  the  interest  of  trade  diversion,  but  to 
grow the level of economic activity in South Africa, the region, and farther flung trading partners 
                                                
4  FDI inflows to Africa are highly concentrated with eight countries, including Algeria, the Congo, Ghana, Morocco, 
Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia receiving more than 70 per cent of the total FDI inflows in 2011. 
South Africa and Nigeria accounts for more than 40 per cent of the FDI inflows to SSA in 2011. 
like the Nordic economies. Africa still has a multiplicity of, and in some instances overlapping 
regional trade blocs, and has some way to go to achieve full trade integration. Further trade 
integration  in  Africa  should  be  pursued  more  purposefully,  supported  by  network  industry 
development.  
Conclusion  
Confidence is a critical factor in whether our economies sink or swim. South Africa has in place 
a range of policy frameworks and a fairly developed level of diversification that cushions the 
domestic  economy  from  adverse  international  conditions.  These  create  confidence  for 
domestic businesses and have  in recent years  contributed to inflows of capital from abroad. 
We  need  to  build  confidence  much  more,  however,  by  ensuring  that  the  people  behind  the 
numbers  are  able  to  respond  to  the  demands  of  economic  adjustment  in  constructive  ways. 
Using our resources wisely can provide the means for developing our human capabilities over 
successive  generations,  in  part  by  developing  markets  and  creating  economic  opportunities 
across the region.  
Thank you.
