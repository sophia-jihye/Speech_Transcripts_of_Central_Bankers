Lars E O Svensson: Monetary policy and employment – monetary policy 
is too tight 
Speech  by  Prof  Lars  E  O  Svensson,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank,  to  the 
Swedish Trade Union Confederation, LO, Stockholm, 16 January 2013. 
 I  would  like  to  thank  Karolina  Ekholm,  Gabriela  Guibourg,  Kerstin  Hallsten,  Per  Jansson,  Kerstin  af  Jochnick, 
Pernilla Johansson, Ulf Söderström, Staffan Viotti and Anders Vredin for useful comments and discussions. Anna 
Lidberg and Marianne Sterner have contributed to this speech. The views expressed here are my own and are 
not necessarily shared by the other members of the Executive Board of the Riksbank or by the Riksbank’s staff.  
Monetary policy is too tight in Sweden 
Although I am myself a member of the Executive Board of the Riksbank, it is hardly a secret 
that  I  see  major  problems  with  Swedish  monetary  policy.  In  a  shorter-run  perspective  one 
can note that both CPI and CPIF inflation are now significantly below the inflation target of 
2 per  cent,  and  that  unemployment  is  way  above  a  reasonable  long-run  sustainable  rate. 
There is no doubt that monetary policy has contributed to this, in that it has been too tight 
since the Riksbank began raising the policy rate in the summer of 2010. This may of course 
sound strange given that the policy rate is at a historically low level. But both short and long 
nominal and real interest rates have shown a negative trend since the mid-1990s and have 
fallen  in  Sweden  and  the  rest  of  the  world.  This  makes  it  misleading  to  now  make  direct 
historical comparisons of the level of the policy rate. The fact that monetary policy has been 
and still is too tight becomes clearer when one sees that the policy rate and the short real 
rates in Sweden have been raised since 2010, and then have been kept high in comparison 
with policy rates and the short real rates in the euro area, the United Kingdom and the United 
States.  This  is  despite  the  fact  that  inflation  in  Sweden  is  significantly  lower  than  in  these 
economies while unemployment is about as high as in the United Kingdom and the United 
States (Figures 1–3). After having been close to the target in early 2010, CPIF inflation in 
Sweden has also since trended downwards to a rate of one per cent or below.1 
Average inflation too low and average unemployment unnecessarily high since 1997 
In a longer perspective, one can note that since 1997, when inflation expectations had been 
anchored to the inflation target, the average rate of inflation in Sweden measured using real-
time data for the CPI has been 1.4 per cent, that is, 0.6 per cent below the target for the CPI, 
which is 2 per cent. This is in stark contrast to the situation in countries such as Australia, 
Canada and the United Kingdom which have had a fixed inflation target as long as Sweden. 
In these countries, the rate of inflation has been at or very close to the inflation target (in the 
case of the United Kingdom until the end of 2007).2 As, according to the Prospera surveys, 
inflation  expectations  in  Sweden  have  been  firmly  anchored  to  the  target  since  1997, 
                                                
1   See Svensson (2011) for a comparison of monetary policy in Sweden and the United States since the summer 
of 2010, including which monetary policy has been better balanced. 
2   As discussed in Svensson (2012d), Australia has had an inflation target in the form of an interval between 
2 and 3 per cent, that is, with a midpoint of 2.5 per cent, since the middle of 1993. Average inflation for the 
period 1997–2011 was 2.7 per cent. Canada has had an inflation target since 1991 and the target has been 
2 per cent since 1995. Average inflation for the period 1997–2011 was 2.0 per cent. The United Kingdom has 
had an inflation target since the end of 1992. From 1996 to 2003 the target was 2.5 per cent measured using 
the RPIX index. Average RPIX inflation for the period 1997–2003 was 2.4 per cent. Since 2004, the target has 
been 2 per cent measured in terms of the CPI. Average CPI inflation for the period 2003–2007 was 2.0 per 
cent.  During  the  period  2008–2012,  the  rate  of  inflation  has  exceeded  the  inflation  target  in  the  United 
Kingdom. However, this is compatible with an optimal monetary policy when unemployment, as in the case of 
the United Kingdom, exceeds a long-run sustainable rate.

average  inflation  has  thus  been  significantly  lower  than  these  expectations.  According  to 
established  theoretical  and  empirical  research  concerning  the  link  between  inflation  and 
unemployment – the so-called expectations-augmented Phillips curve – this means that the 
average rate of unemployment since 1997 has been higher than necessary, according to my 
calculations  approximately  0.8  percentage  points  too  high,  which  is  equivalent  to  about 
38,000 unemployed people in Sweden (Svensson 2012b, d).3 
Monetary policy is an inappropriate instrument for limiting household indebtedness  
Monetary  policy  is  thus  tight  at  the  moment,  with  a  higher  real  short  rate  than  abroad,  an 
inflation rate significantly below the target, and unemployment well above a reasonable long-
run sustainable rate. A possible explanation for this tight monetary policy is that it has aimed 
to  limit  household  indebtedness,  measured  as  the  ratio  between  debt  and  disposable 
income.4 However, as I will soon explain in more detail, according to established theoretical 
and  empirical  research,  monetary  policy  has  only  a  very  limited  short-run  impact  on  the 
household  debt  ratio  and  –  when  inflation  is  low  and  stable  –  no  long-run  impact.  A  tight 
monetary  policy  thus  instead  leads to  inflation  being too  low  and  unemployment  being  too 
high, without having a tangible effect on potential risks arising from household indebtedness. 
In practice, monetary policy has to some extent neglected the price stability objective and led 
to unnecessarily high unemployment. Against this background, it is remarkable that monetary 
policy  in  Sweden  nevertheless  seems  to  have  been  aimed  at  influencing  household 
indebtedness. Any problems arising from household indebtedness could be better managed 
by  other  means  than  the  policy  rate,  such  as  mortgage  caps  and  tax  regulations,  which, 
unlike monetary policy, are effective in both the short run and long run (Svensson 2012c). 
The Riksbank’s mandate – price stability and the highest sustainable employment – 
demands a lower policy rate and policy-rate path 
I thus believe that monetary policy should be more expansionary than it is at present, that is, 
the policy rate and the policy-rate path should be lower. The Riksbank’s mandate should, in 
line with the Sveriges Riksbank Act and its preliminary works, be interpreted as price stability 
and  the  highest  sustainable  employment  (Svensson  2012b).5  The  highest  sustainable 
employment is in practice the same as the lowest sustainable rate of unemployment. Every 
monetary-policy decision thus entails setting the repo rate and selecting the repo-rate path 
that best stabilises inflation around the inflation target and unemployment around a long-run 
sustainable rate.6  
                                                
3   Andersson,  Palmqvist  and  Österholm  (2012)  discuss  the  Riksbank’s  target  attainment  during  a  different 
period, that is a period beginning in 1995 instead of in 1997, which gives an average of 1,5 per cent for CPI-
inflation  in  1995–2011  instead  of  1.4  per  cent.  During  1995–1996,  CPI  inflation  was  1.8  per  cent,  which 
increases  the  average.  However,  in  1995  and  early  1996,  inflation  expectations  according  to  Aragon 
Fondkommission’s surveys were significantly above the target, which all else being equal increases inflation 
and requires a higher rate of unemployment to attain the target (Svensson 2012d). Inflation expectations do 
not become anchored around the target until the latter part of 1996. The period from 1997 and onwards is 
therefore more relevant for assessing target attainment and the real economic costs of falling below the target.  
4   See, for example, Ingves (2012) and Per Jansson’s comments in the minutes of the monetary policy meeting 
held in October 2012 (Sveriges Riksbank 2012c, page 21). 
5   Chapter  1,  article  2  of  the  Sveriges  Riksbank  Act  (SFS  1988:1385)  states  that  “the  objective  of  monetary 
policy is to maintain price stability”. According to the government bill (Swedish government 1997, page 1), that 
proposed the act also states that “as an authority under the Riksdag, the Riksbank, without prejudice to the 
inflation  target,  should  furthermore  support  the  goals  of  general  economic  policy  with  the  aim  to  achieve 
sustainable growth and high employment”. High employment should be interpreted as the highest sustainable 
rate of employment. The idea behind the bill is hardly that there is any conflict between “sustainable growth” 
and “high employment”. See Svensson (2012b) for a further discussion of this. 
It  may  be  interesting  to  note  in  this  context  that  the  Riksbank  has  in  principle  the  same  mandate  as  the 
Federal Reserve. According to the Federal Reserve Act, the US central bank should “promote effectively the

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
Against this  background,  I  have  in  recent  years  advocated  a  significantly  lower  policy  rate 
and  policy-rate  path  in  order  to  attain  an  inflation  rate  closer  to  the  target  and  an 
unemployment rate closer to a long-run sustainable rate. As unemployment has been high 
for a long time and is therefore becoming entrenched, a particularly expansionary monetary 
policy  is  now  needed  to  bring  unemployment  down  to  a  long-run  sustainable  rate.  The 
inflation rate must therefore be temporarily allowed to overshoot the target. In the longer run, 
it is a case of conducting a monetary policy that provides an average rate of CPI inflation at 
or  close  to  the  target  and  of  not  repeating  the  policy  that  has  led  to  unnecessarily  high 
unemployment since 1997.  
I will now go on to discuss why a more expansionary monetary policy would not have any 
significant  effects  on  the  potential  risks  associated  with  household  indebtedness,  what  the 
costs  of  the  tight  monetary  policy  are  in  the  short  and  long  run  in  terms  of  increased 
unemployment,  what  determines  the  long-run  sustainable  rate  of  unemployment,  how  we 
should view the arguments put forward that monetary policy cannot do very much about the 
high  rate  of  unemployment  and  why  a  more  expansionary  monetary  policy  with  inflation 
temporarily  above  the  target  is  needed  to  bring  unemployment  down  to  a  long-run 
sustainable rate. 
Monetary policy has limited short-run effects on household indebtedness and – with 
low and stable inflation – no long-run effects 
As I said earlier, a possible explanation for the tight monetary policy is that in practice the 
aim has been to limit household indebtedness, that is, the household debt ratio. As far as I 
can  see,  there  is  a  misunderstanding  here  about  what  monetary  policy  can  achieve  with 
regard  to  household  indebtedness.  As  I  pointed  out  in  a  speech  in  November  last  year 
(Svensson  2012c)  and  at  the  monetary  policy  meeting  in  December  (Sveriges  Riksbank 
2012d), according to established theoretical and empirical research, including the Riksbank’s 
own studies and calculations, for example Riksbank (2011), monetary policy has  very little 
short-run impact on household indebtedness and, with low and stable inflation, no long-run 
impact. 
Household debt has risen to approximately 170 per cent of disposable income. The debt is 
mainly  mortgages,  so  in  order  to  understand  the  development  of  debt  and  whether  it  is  a 
problem,  we  must  understand  developments  in  housing  prices  and  the  value  of  housing. 
Households’ real assets (owner-occupied homes, second homes and condominiums), have 
grown in pace with their debt and there is a stable relationship between them. The loan-to-
value ratio, the ratio of debt to real assets, has been relatively stable and has remained in the 
interval of 50–60 per cent since the mid-1990s (Figure 4).  
There has been considerable research into how housing prices are determined. As Englund 
(2011)  shows  in  the  Riksbank’s  inquiry  into  the  risks  in  the  Swedish  housing  market,  the 
fundamental value of housing is largely determined by the long real mortgage rate after tax 
and  the  value  of  the  housing  services  provided  by  the  housing.  The  value  of  the  housing 
services  in  turn  has  a  stable  relationship  to  disposable  income  (housing  costs  comprise  
25–30 per cent of disposable income).7 Put simply, the after-tax mortgage rate determines 
how much a homeowner is prepared to pay for his or her home for the housing costs to be 
25 to 30 per cent of the homeowner’s disposable income. This means that the relationship 
between  housing  prices  and  disposable  income  is  largely  determined  by  the  long  real 
mortgage  rate  after  tax,  including  the  effects  of  wealth  and  property  taxes.  As  Englund 
                                                                                                                                                   
goals of maximum employment and stable prices”. In this case too, maximum employment means maximum 
sustainable employment. The Federal Reserve Board (2012) also emphasises the longer-run normal rate of 
unemployment.

demonstrates, developments in Swedish housing prices in relation to disposable income are 
largely explained by a strongly negative trend in long real mortgage rates after tax since the 
mid-1990s.  
The  established  view  of  monetary  policy  is  that  it  is  not  able  to  affect  short  and  long  real 
interest rates in the long run. It can only affect the long real mortgage rate after tax in the 
long  run  to  the  extent  that  the  rate  of  inflation  for  a  given  tax  system  affects  real  tax 
deductions  and  real  wealth  and  property  taxes.  An  inflation target  and low,  stable  inflation 
mean that this opportunity for influence disappears. Then monetary policy will no longer have 
any long-run effect on housing prices in relation to disposable income.8 
Monetary policy could still affect the debt ratio if it could influence the loan-to-value ratio. A 
higher policy rate might limit the debt ratio if it led to a lower loan-to-value ratio, if there was a 
negative  relation  between  the  policy  rate  and  the  loan-to-value  ratio.  As  can  be  seen  in 
Figure 5, however, there is hardly any support for such a relation. Thus, there does not seem 
to be any support for the view that monetary policy could affect indebtedness in the long run. 
In the short run, that is a few years ahead, monetary policy has very little effect on housing 
prices and even less on the debt ratio, as the debt ratio’s numerator and denominator move 
in  the  same  direction  in  the  short  run.  At  the  latest  monetary  policy  meeting  (Sveriges 
Riksbank  2012d)  I  mentioned  a  typical  result  from  empirical  estimates,  namely  that  a  one 
percentage  point  higher  policy  rate  for  four  quarters  leads  to  just  over  2  per  cent  lower 
housing  prices  and  debt  than  would  otherwise  be  the  case.  At  the  same  time,  GDP  and 
disposable  income  become  just  over  one  per  cent  lower  than  they  would  otherwise  have 
been,  while  unemployment  becomes  just  over  0.5  percentage  points  higher,  which 
corresponds to about 25,000 jobs given the current number of individuals in the labour force, 
approximately 5 million. The debt ratio’s numerator is thus just over 2 per cent lower and the 
denominator  just  over  one  per  cent  lower,  so  that  the  debt  ratio  is  just  over  one  per  cent 
lower than it would have been otherwise. Thus, a one per cent lower debt ratio costs about 
25,000 jobs. This is roughly the same relationship that I have mentioned earlier (Svensson 
2012c), that 10 per cent on housing prices costs 6 per cent of GDP and 3 percentage points 
unemployment, that is, 150,000 jobs.9  
As far as I can see, there is thus no support for the view that monetary policy could tangibly 
limit the debt ratio in the short run without major costs in the form of lower inflation and higher 
unemployment.  Other  means  must  be  used  to  influence  the  debt  ratio,  such  as  mortgage 
caps and tax regulations; means that can affect the loan-to-value ratio or long real mortgage 
rates after tax in both the long run and short run. 
What does a tight monetary policy cost? 
As  I  mentioned  earlier,  CPI  inflation  measured  using  real-time  data  has  averaged  1.4  per 
cent  since  1997,  that  is,  0.6  percentage  points  below  the  target.  Has  this  had  any 
consequences  for  the  real  economy?  The  standard  response  to  the  question  of  whether 
missing a target leads to real-economic costs is no. This is because average unemployment, 
according  to  established  theoretical  and  empirical  research,  is  independent  of  monetary 
policy and the inflation rate. However, this presupposes that inflation expectations adjust to 
                                                
8   The fact that the monetary policy conducted in the period 1997 to 2011 led to an unemployment rate that on 
average was 0.8 percentage points higher than would have been the case if the average inflation rate had 
been on target means that average disposable income has been lower – that is, that disposable income has 
grown  at  the  same  average  rate  but  at  a  somewhat  lower  level.  However,  this  does  not  affect  the  ratio 
between average housing prices and disposable income – which depends on the low mortgage rate after tax – 
and thus, at a given loan-to-value ratio, not the debt ratio either.

actual  inflation  and  thus  fall  if  the  rate  of  inflation  falls.  The  long-run  Phillips  curve,  which 
illustrates  the  relationship  between  average  inflation  measured  along  the  vertical  axis  and 
average  unemployment  measured  along  the  horizontal  axis,  then  becomes  vertical  and 
average unemployment thus becomes independent of the average rate of inflation.  
We can see this in Figure 6, which shows unemployment along the horizontal axis and CPI 
inflation along the vertical axis for the years 1976–2012. We can see that during the 1970s 
and 1980s, there was no systematic relationship between inflation and unemployment. The 
long-run Phillips curve, the long-run relationship between inflation and unemployment, could 
be said to be vertical.  
When inflation expectations are anchored, inflation and unemployment are interlinked 
However,  from  1998  and  onwards  things  look  different  (the  red  observations  in  Figure  6). 
When  inflation  expectations  are  anchored  to  the  target  but  inflation  varies,  a  systematic 
trade-off  arises  between  inflation  and  unemployment.  The  black  line  shows  an  estimated 
long-run Phillips curve for the period, a curve that is not vertical but sloping. The estimated 
slope  is  0.75.10  This  means  that  a  one  per  cent  higher  average  rate  of  unemployment  is 
associated  with  a  0.75  per  cent  lower  average  rate  of  inflation.  This  in  turn  means  that  a 
0.6 percentage points lower rate of inflation than the target from 1997 entails a 0.6/0.75 = 0.8 
percentage points higher average rate of unemployment. The average number of people in 
the labour force over the past 15 years has been about 4.7 million. 0.8 per cent of 4.7 million 
is about 38 000. We can thus say that the cost in terms of unemployment of the fact that the 
average rate of inflation has fallen below the target is approximately 38,000 unemployed.11 
As explained in my paper (Svensson 2012d) the sloping long-run Phillips curve is arguably 
relevant  only  when  the  average  rate  of  inflation  deviates  moderately  from  inflation 
expectations  and  the  target  (for  example  deviations  less  than  plus/minus  one  percentage 
point).  In  the  case  of  larger  average  deviations  it  is  likely  that  inflation  expectations  will 
eventually adjust.  
Inflation closer to the target would mean 65,000 fewer unemployed 
An  increase  in  unemployment  of  about  38,000  people  is  the  average  cost  for  the  tight 
monetary policy conducted during the period from 1997 to the end of 2011. So what is the 
cost of the tight policy being conducted now? How much lower would unemployment be now 
if a more expansionary monetary policy had been conducted during the past two years, as 
consistently advocated by my Executive Board colleague Karolina Ekholm and myself since 
summer 2010? 
Let  us  assume  that  inflation  would  have  been  one  percentage  point  higher  and thus  been 
closer to the target now. According to my working paper (2012d), the slope of the long-run 
Phillips curve, 0.75, is not only relevant in the long run, but also a year or so ahead. A rate of 
                                                
10   See  Svensson  (2012d).  A  95  per  cent  confidence  interval  for  the  slope  is  given  by  0.75  ±  0.35,  that  is  an 
interval between 0.4 and 1.1. 
11   The estimate is of course uncertain. As shown in Svensson (2012d), a 95 per cent confidence interval for the 
point estimate 0.8(=0.6/0.75) percentage points is an interval between 0.6/1.1= 0.55 percentage points and 
0.6/0.4  =  1.5  percentage  points.  This  corresponds  to  a  95  per  cent  confidence  interval  for  the  estimate 
38,000 unemployed between 26,000 and 70,000.  
  During the period 1997–2011, inflation measured using the CPIX/CPIF in real time (CPIX to the end of March 
2008 and the CPIF thereafter) was 1.6 percentage points, that is 0.4 percentage points below the target. If the 
long-term  Phillips  curve  is  estimated  using  the  CPIX/CPIF  instead  of  the  CPI,  the  slope  is  less  sharp  and 
estimated with less precision. Despite minor target deviations, the costs in terms of an increased average rate 
of  unemployment  will  then  be  higher,  but  with  a  larger  confidence  interval.  The  link  between  inflation  and 
unemployment  is  thus  stronger  for  inflation  measured  using  the  CPI  than  for  inflation  measured  using  the 
CPIX/CPIF.

inflation  that  is  one  percentage  point  higher  thus  leads  to  unemployment  that  is  about  
1/0.75 = 1.3 percentage points lower.12 With the current number of people in the labour force, 
5 million, 1.3 percentage points corresponds to about 65,000 fewer people unemployed.13  
According to the example I mentioned earlier, a debt ratio that is one per cent lower costs 
about 25,000 more unemployed. This means that a more expansionary monetary policy, with 
65,000  fewer  people  unemployed,  would  have  increased  the  debt  ratio  by  about 
65,000/25,000 = 2.6 per cent. That is, the debt ratio would have increased in the space of a 
few  years  from  about  170  per  cent  of  disposable  income  by  about  4  percentage  points to 
about  174  per  cent.14  It  is  difficult to  believe  that this  would  have  increased  potential  risks 
related to household indebtedness to an extent that is worth more than 65,000 jobs. And as I 
said,  in  the  longer  run  the  debt  ratio  is  not  affected  at  all,  and  thus  there  is  no  effect  on 
potential risks. 
Moreover,  as  unemployment  is  so  high  to  start  with,  I  would  like  to  have  seen  monetary 
policy become so expansionary that inflation temporarily overshot the target. An even higher 
rate  of  inflation  would  by  now  have  reduced  unemployment  by  even  more  than 
65,000 people.15  
The long-run sustainable rate of unemployment depends on how the labour market 
works and on structural conditions 
If we are to stabilise unemployment around a long-run sustainable rate, we must have a view 
of  what  this  rate  is.  However,  the  long-run  sustainable  rate  of  unemployment  is  a  concept 
and a quantity that cannot be measured directly; it must be estimated in different ways. The 
long-run  sustainable  rate  of  unemployment  refers  to  the  unemployment  rate  when  the 
economy is in what is referred to by economists as a “steady state”. When the economy is in 
steady  state,  it  is  in  a  long-run  equilibrium  where  the  effects  of  all  shocks  to  which  the 
economy  has  been  exposed  have  worn  off,  and  the  expectations  of  inflation  and  other 
variables are fulfilled. It is often called the (long-run) natural rate of unemployment.16 It can 
be seen as the forecast for unemployment in the very long run (under the assumption that 
inflation expectations are realised).  
Long-run  sustainable  unemployment,  unlike  long-run  average  inflation,  is  independent  of 
monetary policy. It is determined by structural conditions in the economy, such as how the 
labour  market  and  wage-setting  function,  what  the  replacement  ratio  of  unemployment 
insurance  is,  by  the  systems  for  sick  pay  and  income  tax  and  by  the  demographic 
                                                
12   An estimate using the Riksbank’s model, Ramses, in accordance with the effects of various repo-rate paths as 
described in Svensson (2010), leads to roughly the same estimate of 1.3 percentage points.  
13   A  95-per  cent  confidence  interval  for  the  point  estimate  1.3(=1/0.75)  percentage  points  gives  an  interval 
between  1/1.1=  0.9  percentage  points  and  1/0.4=2.5  percentage  points,  corresponding  to  a  confidence 
interval for the estimate 65,000 unemployed between 45,000 and 125,000.  
14   2.6 per cent of 170 per cent is about 4 per cent. 
15   Moreover, according to one of Qvigstad’s (2005) criteria for a good policy rate path – applied to unemployment 
– inflation should normally overshoot the target when unemployment exceeds its long-run sustainable rate. 
16   As Rogerson (1997) points out, there are different definitions of “the natural rate of unemployment”, but he 
convincingly  claims  that  the  only  definition  of  equilibrium  unemployment  that  is  well-specified  and 
unambiguous  is  the  one  corresponding  to  unemployment  in  steady  state.  Academic  literature  contains 
different definitions of short-run and time-varying equilibrium unemployment, such as short-run NAIRU (short-
run Non-Acceleration Inflation Rate of Unemployment – the rate of unemployment that will lead to a constant 
rate of inflation in the short run) and flexi-price unemployment (the rate of unemployment that would arise if 
prices and wages were flexible). These definitions are very dependent on models and not very robust, as they 
rely on such a large number of assumptions. Blanchard and Gali (2010) give some theoretical support for why 
monetary  policy  should  be  aimed  at  stabilising  unemployment  around  a  steady-state  level,  in  addition  to 
stabilising inflation around the inflation target.

composition of the population. If these structural conditions change over time, the long-run 
sustainable rate of unemployment will also change. There is evidence that the labour market 
reforms, tax deductions for those who work and changes in the sick pay and unemployment 
insurance  in  recent  years  have  contributed  to  reducing  the  long-run  sustainable  rate  of 
unemployment (Swedish Ministry of Finance 2011, Sveriges Riksbank 2012a). 
As  the  long-run  sustainable  rate  of  unemployment  is  determined  by  the  functioning  of  the 
economy and structural conditions, but is not directly observable, it must be estimated using 
various  econometric  and  statistical  methods.  Different  authorities  have  obtained  different 
results. The Swedish Ministry of Finance (2011) has made what is so far the most thorough 
and detailed estimate for long-run sustainable unemployment, and concludes that the rate is 
5 per cent. The estimate is made in two stages. In the first stage, a long-run sustainable rate 
of unemployment is estimated for the year 2006, the year before the government began its 
reforms  in  the  labour  market  area.  This  estimate  results  in  a  long-run  sustainable  rate  of 
unemployment of 6.6 per cent. In the second stage, the effects of demographical changes in 
the  labour  force  are  estimated,  as  well  as  the  effects  of  an  unchanged  ceiling  for  the 
unemployment  benefit  and  structural  reforms.  This  results  in  a  reduction  of  the  long-run 
sustainable rate of unemployment of 1.6 percentage points, to 5 per cent (Ministry of Finance 
2011,  Table  1.1).  The  National  Institute  of  Economic  Research  (2012)  estimates  a  time-
dependent  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  that  reaches  6  per  cent  in  2020,  so  6  per  cent 
could  be  regarded  as  the  Institute’s  estimate  of  long-run  sustainable  unemployment.  An 
average  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance’s  and  the  National  Institute  of  Economic  Research’s 
estimates would then be 5.5 per cent, way below the current rate of unemployment. 
The fact that inflation has been lower than inflation expectations means that the long-
run sustainable rate of unemployment may have been overestimated  
The Riksbank (2012a) presents a briefer estimate of long-run sustainable unemployment in 
the  form  of  the  interval  5–7.5  per  cent,  thus  with  a  midpoint  of  6.25  per  cent.  Long-run 
sustainable unemployment is calculated in two stages, as by the Ministry of Finance (2011). 
In the first stage, long-run sustainable unemployment in 2006 is estimated in the form of the 
interval  6.5–7.5  per  cent,  that  is,  with  a  midpoint  of  7  per  cent  (to  be  compared  with  the 
Ministry  of  Finance’s  corresponding  estimate  of  6.6  per  cent).  The  second  stage  entails 
estimating the  effect  of government  reforms  and  changes  in  the  composition  of  the  labour 
force on long–run sustainable unemployment since 2006, in the form of an interval of 0 to 
1.5 percentage  points,  that  is,  with  a  midpoint  of  0.75  percentage  points  (to  be  compared 
with the Ministry of Finance’s corresponding estimate of 1.6 percentage points). When this 
interval is deducted from the first one, we get an interval of 5–7.5 per cent, with a midpoint of 
6.25 per cent (to be compared with the Ministry of Finance’s corresponding estimate of 5 per 
cent).  
The Riksbank uses as a base in the first stage the average rate of unemployment during the 
period  1999–2006,  that  is,  about  7  per  cent,  which  is  then  made  into  a  midpoint  in  the 
estimated  interval  of  6–7.5  per  cent.  This  can  be  regarded  as  an  estimate  of  long-run 
sustainable  unemployment  up  to  2006,  before  the  government’s  reforms.  However,  the 
estimate  disregards  the  fact  that  average  inflation  has  undershot  average  inflation 
expectations.  As  I  explain  in  an  annex  to  the  minutes  from  the  meeting  in  July  2012 
(Svensson (2012a)), this difference between inflation and inflation expectations means that 
average  unemployment  becomes  a  biased  estimate  of  the  long-run  sustainable  rate  of 
unemployment. When I take this difference into account, I reach the conclusion that the bias 
is  approximately  0.75  percentage  points.  All  else  being  equal,  the  Riksbank’s  estimate 
should  then  be  reduced  by  0.75  percentage  points,  whereby  the  Riksbank’s  final  interval 
after the adjustment will be 4.25–6.75 per cent, with a midpoint of 5.5 per cent. 
The  estimates  made  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the  National  Institute  of  Economic 
Research  do  not  take  into  account  the  fact  that  average  inflation  has  been  lower  than 
inflation  expectations,  either,  so  their  estimates  may  also  need  to  be  adjusted  downwards

somewhat. The average of the Ministry of Finance’s and the National Institute of Economic 
Research’s  estimates  so  far  and  of  the  Riksbank’s  estimate  after  my  adjustment  is  in  any 
case  be  5.5  per  cent.  While  awaiting  new  estimates  that  take  into  account  the  bias  that 
average inflation lower than average inflation expectations entails, I will use 5.5 per cent as 
my own assessment of long-run sustainable unemployment.  
More expansionary monetary policy can reduce unemployment 
Can a less tight monetary policy really reduce unemployment in our present situation? I think 
it can. 
Expansionary monetary policy improves matching… 
It is often said that the matching of jobseekers to job vacancies is not functioning as well now 
as it did before, and that monetary policy cannot do anything about this.17 The discussion in 
the  Fiscal  Policy  Council’s  report  for  2012  (Fiscal  Policy  Council  2012)  is  relevant  in  this 
context. This shows that matching for both experienced and inexperienced labour is sensitive 
to  demand  fluctuations  and  improves  when  demand  in  the  labour  market  improves.  It  is 
however more sensitive to economic fluctuations in the case of inexperienced labour. This 
means that if the demand for labour increases, matching improves most for inexperienced 
labour.  
The  business  cycle,  and  thus  monetary  policy,  therefore  plays  a  role  for  the  matching 
process, and a more expansionary monetary policy that leads to a higher demand for labour 
improves  matching  most  for  the  vulnerable  groups.  Monetary  policy  can  thus  contribute  to 
improving  matching  in  the  labour  market.  The  deficiencies  in  matching  are,  in  the  current 
economic downturn, an argument in favour of more, not less, expansionary monetary policy. 
…and gives vulnerable groups of unemployed a better chance of getting jobs 
It is also often said that more of those in vulnerable groups with a high rate of unemployment, 
such as young people and people born abroad, have entered the labour market and that this, 
rather than the business cycle, explains why unemployment has increased.18 However, it is 
the vulnerable groups that are most sensitive to economic fluctuations. They are the first to 
be given notice of redundancy if they have a job, and they are the last to be offered a job if 
they are unemployed. They are thus more vulnerable to fluctuations in the demand for labour 
and if they are to get jobs and work experience if they are unemployed, we need to have a 
very large demand for labour and thus very expansionary monetary policy. As a large share 
of the labour force now has job chances that are sensitive to demand, one could claim that 
employment as a whole has now become more sensitive to demand fluctuations. Increased 
demand could then have greater effect on employment and unemployment than it did before. 
The fact that more people in vulnerable groups have now entered the labour market is thus 
an argument in favour of a more, not a less, expansionary monetary policy. 
High unemployment over a long time requires more expansionary monetary policy to 
bring down unemployment 
The fact that unemployment has been high over a long period of time has meant that long-
term  unemployment  has  increased.  It  is  a  well-known  phenomenon  that  long-term 
unemployed have greater difficulty in obtaining jobs, for several reasons. A person who finds 
                                                
17   See, for instance, Sveriges Riksbank (2012c). 
18   According to the Swedish Public Employment Service, there are four groups who have a relatively vulnerable 
position on the labour market and who find it difficult to get a new job if they become unemployed: those born 
outside Europe, people with less than upper-secondary school education, people in the age group 55–64 and 
people with a physical disability which reduces their capacity to work.

themself outside of the labour market suffers not only personal loss and a feeling of isolation, 
they also find that their skills become outdated after a while, which makes it more difficult to 
get  a  new  job.  A  high  rate  of  unemployment  over  a  long  period  of  time  can  become 
entrenched and requires a very large demand for labour so that the long-term unemployed 
can find work. One says that unemployment becomes persistent. The longer unemployment 
has been high, the more difficult it is, the longer it takes and the larger the labour demand 
that is needed to bring down unemployment. The fact that unemployment has been high for a 
long time and that long-term unemployment has increased, is also an argument now for a 
more, rather than a less, expansionary monetary policy. 
Temporarily high inflation is needed to reduce unemployment 
One consequence of high unemployment over a long period of time and of unemployment 
tending to become entrenched at higher rates, is that inflation will be higher for a given rate 
of unemployment. This means that a sufficiently large demand for labour to bring down the 
high  unemployment  towards  a  long-run  sustainable  rate  will  lead  to  higher  inflation  than 
normal for a period of time. It is therefore important to allow inflation to overshoot the target 
for a number of years. This would be a necessary cost that should be weighed against the 
gain of bringing down unemployment. As inflation on average has fallen below the target, an 
inflation  rate  above  the  target  would  at  present  also  have  the  advantage  that  average 
inflation over a long period would come closer to the target, something that would contribute 
to avoiding the unnecessarily high average unemployment that earlier policies have caused.  
According  to  Prospera’s  surveys,  inflation  expectations  have  stabilised  at  2  per  cent  from 
1997,  despite  average  inflation  being  lower.  Inflation  expectations  would  thus  probably  be 
stable even if inflation were to overshoot the target for a period of time.  
Summary: Monetary policy too tight 
My  conclusion  is  that  monetary  policy  in  Sweden  is  and  has  been  too  tight.  Real  short 
interest rates are much higher in Sweden than in the euro area, the United Kingdom and the 
United  States  from  2010  onwards,  despite  the  fact  that  inflation  in  Sweden  is  significantly 
lower  than  in  these  economies  and  it  is  now  well  below  the  target  at  the  same  time  as 
unemployment is as high as, or higher than, in the United Kingdom and the United States. 
The cost of the tight monetary policy in terms of unemployment is high, both in a short and 
long-run  perspective.  In  practice,  monetary  policy  has  to  some  extent  neglected  the  price 
stability objective and led to unnecessarily high unemployment.  
According to extensive theoretical and empirical research, monetary policy normally has little 
effect  in  the  short  run  on  housing  prices  and  household  indebtedness,  compared  with  its 
effects on inflation and unemployment, and when inflation is low and stable, it has no long-
run  effects  on  housing  prices  and  indebtedness.  A  tight  monetary  policy  aimed  at  limiting 
household  indebtedness  then  leads to  inflation being too  low  and  unemployment  too  high, 
without  having  a  tangible  effect  on  potential  risks  arising  from  household  indebtedness. 
Monetary  policy  should  therefore  not  be  used  to  try  to  influence  housing  prices  and 
indebtedness.  Against  this  background,  it  is  remarkable  that  monetary  policy  in  Sweden 
nevertheless appears to have been aimed at influencing household indebtedness in the short 
and long run, resulting in large costs to the real economy, despite the lack of support for this 
stance in both scientific research and previous experience. 
Monetary policy should aim to stabilise inflation around the target and unemployment around 
a long-run sustainable rate. It should also be aimed at keeping inflation around the target on 
average  over  a  longer  period  of  time,  to  avoid  repeating  the  policy  than  has  led  to 
unnecessarily  high  unemployment  since  1997.  The 
rate  of 
unemployment depends on the way the labour market functions and on structural conditions, 
and it must be estimated using empirical methods. These estimates should take into account 
long-run  sustainable

the fact that average inflation has been lower than the average inflation expectations since 
1997, to avoid a bias in estimating the long-run sustainable rate of unemployment. 
The problems with poorer matching, increasing long-term unemployment and a larger share 
of  vulnerable  groups  on  the  labour  market  are  arguments  in  favour  of  a  more,  not  less, 
expansionary monetary policy so that we can bring down the high unemployment to a long-
run sustainable rate. At present, when unemployment has been high over a long period of 
time, we need a particularly expansionary monetary policy, a large demand for labour and an 
inflation rate that is temporarily allowed to overshoot the target to bring down unemployment. 
As inflation on average has fallen below the target, an inflation rate above the target would at 
present also have the advantage that average inflation over a long period would come closer 
to  the  target,  something  that  would  contribute  to  avoiding  the  unnecessarily  high  average 
unemployment that earlier policies have caused.
