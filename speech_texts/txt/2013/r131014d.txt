It is, indeed, a pleasure for me to be amidst you this morning to deliver the opening 
address at the sixth Annual Banking Conference “Bank on it, 2013” organized by the NMIMS 
University. It is heartening to be among the budding management professionals who would 
be the corporate leaders of tomorrow. The Conference has hosted some illustrious speakers 
in the past and deliberated upon various pertinent issues impacting the banking system. I am 
glad that the Institute has chosen “Sustaining Growth Amidst Adversity” as the theme for this 
year’s  Conference,  a  theme  which  could  not  be  more  apt  considering  the  widespread 
concerns about the decline in growth momentum in the economy. Having an insider’s view of 
India’s financial system, first as a commercial banker and now as a central banker, I intend to 
use this platform today to share my perspectives on India’s growth, enterprise, governance, 
etc. and what needs to be done to return to the high growth trajectory and to sustain it. It is 
all the more inspiring to talk to students on this theme as they are the ones who are going to 
be “generators” of growth and the torch bearers for the Indian economy in the days ahead. 
3. 
We  are  all  discussing  the  different  projections  of  growth  likely  to  be  achieved  by 
India in the current year. The range of projections for the growth in real GDP at factor cost by 
various  agencies  (being  quoted  in  the  media)  is  quite  wide,  between  4.25  per  cent  and 
5.5 per cent. One must realize that the growth projections made by RBI and, for that matter, 
by  any  other  institution  are  indicative  and  contingent  upon  certain  assumptions.  We  can’t 
expect people to sit idle at their homes and the projected growth rate to be achieved. There 
is  a  general  misconception  that  all  the  ills  of the  economy  can  be  cured  by  RBI  or  by  the 
financial  system.  We  must  understand  that  the  financial  system,  on  its  own,  cannot 
accelerate the growth process; it can only facilitate the economic growth by providing finance 
to the real sector. The basic impetus for sustainable growth has to necessarily emanate from 
the real sector. All of us are now well aware that the origins of the Global Financial Crisis lay 
in too much of financial innovation and the financial sector running too far ahead of the real 
sector. So, a total dependence on the financial sector to solve the problems of the real sector 
and accelerate the growth process is unrealistic. 
Introduction 
4. 
Coming to the topic of discussion today, i.e. “Sustaining Growth Amidst Adversity”, I 
think  it  would  have  perhaps  been  more  apt  to call  it  “Improving Growth Amidst  Adversity”. 
Mind  you,  the  crisis  has  affected  all  the  economies  globally.  In  order  for  us  to  extricate 
ourselves from the deep morass, the first thing to be done is to start thinking positively and to 
stop the blame game. Blaming the central bank, banks, the policy makers, the government, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 1 
etc. for  the  crisis  is  not going  to  help. Our  starting  point  has to  be  an  analysis  of  why  the 
crisis  happened  in  the  first  place  or,  more  generally,  why  adversities  strike?  There  are,  of 
course, many reasons put forth, some economic in nature, some social and some political. I 
would discuss these in due course. But one common reason that could perhaps be attributed 
to all crises is an all round decline in  virtue or discipline. Let me invoke Lord Shri Krishna 
here. In Chapter 4 of The Bhagavad Gita, he says: 
“यदा  यदा  �ह  धमर्स्य  ग्ला�नभर्व�त  भारत  ।  अभ्युत्थानमधमर्स्य  तदात्मानं  सृजाम्यहम्  ॥ 
प�रत्राणाय साधूनां �वनाशाय च दुष्कृताम् । धमर्संस्थापनाथार्य सम्भवा�म युगे युगे ॥” 
This  verse  means  that  “Whenever  and  wherever  there  is  a  decline  in  virtue  and  a 
predominant  rise  of  irreligion,  at  that  time  I  descend  myself  to  deliver  the  pious  and  to 
annihilate the miscreants, as well as to re-establish the principles of religion. I myself appear 
millennium after millennium.” 
5. 
If we extend this logic to the generation of crisis situation in the financial sector, we 
may  conclude  that  financial  crisis  happens  in  order  to  weed  out  corrupt,  inefficient  and 
fraudulent elements from the system which generally are kept under check in normal times 
through good regulations, good policies and good corporate governance practices. The silver 
lining, however, is that crises of such magnitude normally happen only once in a life time. To 
emerge out of the crisis and move on to a high growth path, we need to develop good virtues 
and  eliminate  wrong  practices-  indiscipline  being  one  of  them.  We  need  to  be  more 
disciplined  in  our  personal  and  professional  roles,  more  transparent  in  our  work-life,  must 
reduce  wastages,  work  harder,  enhance  our  productivity  and  efficiency  and  upgrade  our 
skills. 
What is our potential growth? 
6. 
Let me now turn to the economic aspect of the theme subject. The first part of the 
topic,  “Sustaining  Growth”,  raises  the  question  “what  growth  do  we  need  to  achieve  and 
sustain”? This leads us to the issue of “potential growth”. “What is the potential growth rate of 
the Indian Economy?” This question has been a subject of active debate in the academic and 
policy research circles. There are several methodological issues surrounding the estimation 
of  potential  output.  Broadly  speaking,  there  are  two  approaches,  the  growth  accounting 
approach  and  the  statistical  filtering  techniques.  The  use  of  different  estimation  methods 
yield different results leading to considerable uncertainty. Further, in the Indian context, the 
non-availability of relevant data aggravates the problem of estimation. Reserve Bank of India 
estimates that the trend/potential growth rate of the Indian economy, which averaged around 
8.5 per cent during 2005–06 to 2007–08, dipped gradually thereafter and presently stands at 
about 7.0 per cent. The draft Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012–2017) document indicates that 
our full growth potential remains around 9 per cent. To get a perspective on these numbers, 
let me now recount India’s growth experience since 1951–52. 
India’s growth journey – a recap 
7. 
India’s  economic  growth  story  since  independence  makes  an  interesting  reading. 
We can identify about five major phases of growth in India in the sixty-three years since 1950 
(Table  1  and  Chart  1).  As  you  all  know,  the  first  phase  coincides  with  the  “low  growth” 
period.1 During the first phase, 1951–52 to 1979–80, the average annual real GDP grew at 
3.5  per  cent  and  per  capita  income  grew  at  1.3  per  cent,  the  so-called  “Hindu  Rate  of 
                                                
1   The ending date of the first phase is still debated. Many economists now argue that the economy moved to a higher 
growth path around 1980–81, a decade prior to the initiation of comprehensive structural reforms in the early 1990s. 
2 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
Growth  accelerated  during  the  second  phase  (1980–81 
Growth”2.  Growth  was  primarily  driven  by  domestic  consumption.  Investment  rate  was  low 
and mostly financed by domestic savings and thus the Current Account Deficit (CAD) was 
less  than  1  per  cent  of  GDP.  Growth  during  this  phase  was  led  by  the  industrial  sector 
followed by the services sector (Table 2). 
8. 
to  1993–94).  The 
acceleration in growth during the 1980s was due to a number of factors, including the early 
efforts  at  industrial  and  trade  liberalization  and  tax  reform  during  the  1980s,  a  step-up  in 
public investment, better performance of all three sectors, and an increasingly expansionist 
fiscal  policy  (Centre’s  revenue  deficit  and  capital  expenditure  both  increased  as  a  ratio  to 
GDP in the 1980s). With investment growth outpacing the domestic savings, CAD increased. 
With growth picking up, WPI inflation also increased. 
9. 
The  growth  process  of  the  1980s,  however,  turned  increasingly  unsustainable  as 
manifest  in  the  growing  macroeconomic  imbalances  over  the  decade  in  the  form  of  high 
fiscal deficit, high levels of CAD, and increasing levels of external debt, besides a repressive 
and  weakening  financial  system.  These  imbalances  culminated  in  the  unprecedented 
external payments crisis in 1991,  which  was managed with the introduction of stabilization 
and structural reforms. 
10. 
The  economy  stabilized  around  1993–94  and  growth  picked  up  again.  The  third 
phase  (1994–95  to  2002–03)  witnessed  relatively  higher  growth  which  ended,  however,  in 
2002–03  with  the  economy  being  hit  by  a  severe  drought.  Investment  and  savings  rate 
picked up and the CAD moderated. Inflation also declined. The economy rebounded in the 
next five years (the fourth phase: 2003–04 to 2007–08) to post an average growth of nearly 
9 per  cent  with  pick-up  in  investment.  With  domestic  saving  growth  outpacing  investment, 
CAD  declined  further.  Inflation  was  also  benign.  With  the  enactment  of  the  Fiscal 
Responsibility and Budget Management Acts by the Central Government and various State 
Governments, the fiscal deficit was also brought under control. This period was, perhaps, the 
“golden  period”  in  India’s  growth  history  and,  consequently,  sparked  off  the  debate  about 
whether the Indian economy had transformed from an “elephant into a tiger”.3  
11. 
The Indian economy grew at 9.5 per cent during the three-year period from 2005–06 
to  2007–08  enabled  by  moderate  inflation, fiscal  consolidation  and  acceleration  in  savings 
and investment. This was the highest average growth rate achieved during any three year 
period in the history of independent India and it was second only to China among the major 
countries during that period. 
India’s  high  growth  story  was  cut-short,  perhaps  prematurely,  beginning  with  the 
12. 
global financial crisis of 2008–09 (real GDP growth dropped to 6.7 per cent). The focus of 
macroeconomic policy then was to arrest the contagion of the global crisis. In 2009–10, the 
focus  of  macroeconomic  policy  shifted  from  containing  the  contagion  to  management  of 
recovery. The economy rebounded strongly in 2009–10 (8.6 per cent) and 2010–11 (9.3 per 
cent). Coordinated fiscal and monetary policies played a significant role in the recovery of the 
economy  and  in  the  maintenance  of  financial  market  stability.  The  growth  momentum  has 
been losing steam since then, with growth rates of 6.2 per cent in 2011–12, 5.0 per cent in

“Professor Raj Krishna was one of the first to draw pointed attention to the inadequacy of our growth performance, 
when  in  the  mid-seventies,  he  coined  the  much  quoted  phrase  ‘the  Hindu  rate  of  growth’  to  describe  India’s 
disappointing  trend  growth”  Montek  Singh  Ahluwalia  (1995),  “Economic  Reforms  for  the  Nineties”,  lecture 
delivered as the First Raj Krishna Memorial Lecture in April 1995 at the University of Rajasthan accessed from the 
Planning  Commission  website  http://planningcommission.gov.in/aboutus/speech/spemsa/msa033.pdf.  However, 
“there is nothing in the literature that suggests that this period of the ‘Hindu Rate of Growth’ had anything to do with 
Hinduism  per  se…  that  had  a  lot  to  do  with  the  Indian  version  of  Socialism.”  (Virmani,  (2004)  “India’s  Economic 
Growth: From Socialist Rate of Growth to  Bharatiya Rate of  Growth”, Working Paper  No. 122, ICRIER, February 
2004.).

2012–13 and projected to be around 5.5 per cent in the current year 2013–14. The services 
sector, which had been the main driver of India’s high growth, also decelerated. The drop in 
growth was a result of a combination of domestic and global factors. Global macroeconomic 
and financial uncertainty, weak external demand, elevated price levels, widening twin deficits 
and falling investment combined to adversely impact growth. 
13. 
One  should  also  remember  that  due  to  the  high  growth  achieved  in  the  previous 
years,  the  aspiration  of  the  people  in  general  has  gone  up  and  nobody  is  happy  with  a 
5.5 per cent growth rate. But the problem is that although everybody aspires to grow by more 
than  9  per  cent,  nobody  wants  to  perspire  (work  hard)  for  achieving  it.  For  our  society  to 
prosper we have to consistently achieve a growth rate of above 9% for the foreseeable future 
and for this, the real sector would have to grow consistently. This can only be achieved by 
increasing productivity and efficiency and ensuring optimum utilization of resources. Let me 
add that it is also for the budding management professionals like you to go to the field and 
put  in  place  systems  that  will  encourage  the  people  to  aspire  and  perspire  to  achieve  the 
potential growth. 
How have we fared vis-à-vis the rest of the World? 
14. 
We have been one of the fastest growing economies in the World. This is evidenced 
in the growing share of India in the World’s GDP in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms 
since 1980 (Chart 2). As I mentioned earlier also, the challenges that currently confront our 
economy are not unique to India. Several countries across the globe are grappling with the 
problem  of  tardy  growth  rates.  One  of  the  unwelcome  consequences  of  Indian  economy’s 
growing  integration  with  the  rest  of  the  world  is  that  we  are  no  longer decoupled from  the 
global economic growth trends. The current low rate of economic growth globally, has also 
hampered our mission of regaining higher growth rates. 
What have been our strengths over the years? 
Vibrant democracy has made India resilient 
That  India  has  been  a  vibrant  democracy  since  the  adoption  of  the  Indian 
15. 
Constitution has been our greatest strength. In the more than six and a half decades since 
independence,  the  nation  has  faced many  adversities,  external  aggression  and  famines  in 
the early years, some drought years, the oil crisis of the 70s, the BoP Crisis in the early 90s 
followed by the South-east Asian crisis in the late 90s, the global financial crisis that began 
with the US sub-prime crisis and currently, the eurozone crisis. A vibrant democracy and our 
resilience have helped us surpass all the adversities so far. I am sure we will wade through 
the current crisis as well. 
India has the capability to grow at 9 per cent and above 
16. 
Looking at our growth history and our performance vis-à-vis the rest of the World, 
we can definitely say that the Indian economy has the potential to grow at 9  per cent and 
above.  Therefore,  we  are  currently  growing  below  our  potential  and  closing  this  negative 
output  gap  (i.e.,  actual  growth  minus  potential  growth)  should  be  our  highest  priority.  The 
next priority would be to raise the potential growth path itself. 
17. 
However, there are some fundamental problems facing our economy which require 
urgent corrective measures. There is a common perception in the society that RBI is killing 
growth by keeping the interest rates high. Here, I want clarify that it is not because of RBI but 
because  of  inflation  that  the  interest  rates  in  the  system  are  high.  And  for  the  inflation  to 
moderate, the productivity and efficiency of all sectors in the economy has to improve. If we 
have to achieve growth rate of 9 per cent and above, the inflation has to be below 5 per cent. 
The  higher  inflation  also  puts  pressure  on  our  exchange  rate  and  further  aggravates  the 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
problem  of  Current  Account  Deficit.  Added  to  that  is  the  problem  of  import  of  gold.  India 
being  a  poor  country  and  in  need  for  foreign  exchange,  the  import  of  gold  of  more  than 
$56 billion  will not help in controlling the CAD and bringing down the inflation. While there 
has been some moderation in gold imports, primarily due to the recent measures introduced 
by  the  Government  and  the  Reserve  Bank,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  create  awareness 
among the people about the problems faced by the country due to the high import of gold. 
This calls for a cultural change and I place my hope on this young brigade of management 
students to bring that orientation in the society. Let me re-emphasize that currency stability 
can only be achieved by bringing down inflation and CAD within manageable limits. 
18. 
So  far,  growth  has  primarily  been  driven  by  domestic  consumption  followed  by 
investment  which  was  funded  mostly  through  domestic  savings.  But  in  a  persistently  high 
inflation  economy  the  propensity  of  the  people  to  save  has  gradually  declined,  which  is 
hampering  our  investments.  Therefore,  we  have  to  increasingly  rely  on  foreign  inflows  for 
achieving the potential growth. In this context, there is a need to have a relook at the current 
policies  governing  FDI  in  sectors  like  Retail,  Banking,  Insurance,  etc.  Actually  we  have  a 
situation where we are asking more questions when the money comes in rather than when 
money is going out. We have to create policies which are conducive for the funds to flow into 
our  economy  for  helping  the  economic  growth.  Concomitantly,  we  also  have  to  create  an 
enabling environment for rekindling the savings habit among ordinary citizens. 
Reaping the demographic dividend 
19. 
India  is  a  young  nation  and  our  population  is  also  young.  This  “demographic 
dividend”,  which  has  helped  us  in  the  past,  would  definitely  help  us  in  the  future  as  well. 
However, in this age of technology and innovation, we need highly skilled human capital to 
give us an edge over other nations. For this, India needs to considerably step up its public 
spending  on  education  and  health.  The  quality  of  education  also  needs  to  undergo  a 
significant change towards promoting innovation and entrepreneurship. More funds need to 
be invested for setting up institutions in the areas of Research and Development with special 
emphasis on improving productivity and efficiency in labour intensive sectors like agriculture, 
medium  and  small  industries,  etc.  It  is  important  to  recognize  that  unless  we  are  able  to 
properly harness the demographic dividend, it could turn into a demographic curse. 
20. 
One  more  advantage  which  we  have  is  that  our  overall  levels  of  productivity  and 
efficiency are so low that the only way for it is to go up. You are a blessed lot who would 
have the skill sets to do well when you go out in the job market. Believe me, there is and 
always will be a demand for skilled professionals in not only a growing economy like India, 
but also worldwide. 
Issues that remain and how do we resolve them, going forward? 
21. 
Various reasons are attributed to the growth slowdown in recent times, some global 
and some domestic. The global factors, of course, are well-known, which include the global 
financial  and  economic  crisis  followed  by  the  Eurozone  crisis  and  in  recent  times,  the 
uncertainty over the US Fed’s move on tapering off the quantitative easing. My focus here is 
more on the domestic issues as these are under our control. 
Governance and policy issues 
22. 
India is still below average on key governance parameters as indicated by the World 
Bank’s worldwide governance indicators compiled from 1996 to 2012. There have not been 
significant  improvements  in  our  governance  (Chart  3).  Clearly,  there  is  a  lot  of  scope  for 
improvement on these parameters. Both our overall governance and corporate governance 
needs improvement. In fact, we need better governance at every level – from hospital and 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 5 
educational institutions to polity, firms, non-profit institutions, banking and finance, regulation, 
land records and even in our daily lives. 
Optimising the use of natural resources 
23. 
wind, water, energy and mineral resources. 
We need to devise suitable policies that optimize the use of natural resources, like 
Enhancing infrastructure investments 
24. 
Every developed economy has world class infrastructure and we are fortunate that 
we  do  not  have  any  dearth  of  skilled  engineers  who  can  build  these  infrastructure  for  our 
country. But our problem is that while there is a demand for world class infrastructure, people 
are generally not inclined to pay for utilising these facilities. This attitude in our society has to 
change  and  people  have  to  realize  that  unless  these  infrastructure  facilities  become  self-
sustaining, further investments in setting up such infrastructure may not be forthcoming. In 
this context, it is certain that we would have to make some sacrifices of our natural resources 
but it is equally important to ensure that people who are displaced are compensated in a just 
and  equitable  manner.  Increasing  investments  in  infrastructure  and  implementing  the 
projects within a reasonable time frame, would provide a much needed fillip to the economy 
and galvanize it for all round progress and development. 
Innovation and entrepreneurship 
India has been lagging behind in innovation and entrepreneurship. We are ranked 
25. 
89th  out  of  the  118  nations  in  the  Global  Entrepreneurship  and  Development  Index,  2013 
(GEDI), published by GEDI, a specialized non-profit research and consulting firm. The “Doing 
Business  2013  report”,  a  study  conducted  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation  of  the 
World Bank Group ranks India at 173rd among the 185 countries surveyed on the criteria of 
“starting a business”. As I mentioned earlier, our education system needs to restructure itself 
significantly to promote innovation and entrepreneurship. As students of one of the premier 
institutions  for  management  education  in  the  country,  I  do  expect  that  many  of  you  would 
unleash  your  entrepreneurial  energies  to  set  up  successful  start-up  business  ventures 
instead of merely building up careers in already established firms. 
Funding of Entrepreneurship 
26. 
Funding is one of the key concerns for any start-up venture. In this regard, it may be 
mentioned  that  SEBI  data  shows  that  investment  by  Venture  Capital  Funds  (VCFs)  and 
Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs), which had peaked at about 3.1 per cent of GDP 
at current market prices in Q3 of 2010(Jul-Sept), has started declining since then (Chart 4). 
There is a need to reverse this trend. 
27. 
India is emerging as an attractive destination for risk capital. There is, however, a 
need  to  further  improve  the  entrepreneurial  ecosystem  by  enhancing  availability  of  risk 
capital to entrepreneurs at start-up and early stage. It was in this context that the Planning 
Commission  constituted,  in  October  2011,  a  Committee  on  Angel  Investment  and  Early 
Stage Venture Capital chaired by Shri Sunil Mitra.4  
28. 
The  Sunil  Mitra  Committee  believes  India’s  entrepreneurial  growth  can  be 
accelerated by creating more conducive conditions – a catalytic government and regulatory 
environment,  adequate  capital  flows  (both  debt  and  equity),  support  from  businesses  and 
society, and availability of appropriate talent and mentoring. Keeping in view the significant 
                                                
4   The report of the Committee is available at planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/rep_eco2708.pdf.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
impact  of  taking  forward  these  recommendations  in  the  strategic  area  of  employment  and 
wealth creation in the country within the coming decade, the Committee had proposed the 
entrustment of the critical task of coordination to a National Entrepreneurship Mission. The 
recommendations  of  the  Committee  need  to  be  examined  in  detail  and  appropriate  action 
initiated on a priority basis so that bottlenecks in flow of funds to new ventures are overcome. 
Ease of doing business 
India still needs to go a long way in creating an enabling and conducive business 
29. 
environment. We are ranked 132nd of the 185 countries in the “ease of doing business” as 
per the “Doing Business 2013” report. We need to create an effective institutional framework 
to support the genuine needs of businesses and to ensure that the entrepreneurial spirit of 
our people is not curbed by avoidable procedural complications. I am sure the Government 
and policy makers are fully seized of the issue and steps are being taken to remediate the 
situation. 
Enhancing productivity 
30. 
Low  productivity  has  been  a  constraint  over  the  years,  more  so  in  the  case  of 
agriculture  and  industry,  perhaps  less  so  in  the  case  of  the  services  sector.  For  instance, 
India is the second largest producer of Rice, Wheat, Sugarcane and Groundnut in the World 
(in  2010).  However,  the  yields  of  these  crops  are  much  lower  than  that  in  the  leading 
countries. There is an urgent need to enhance productivity in all the sectors as it is one of the 
critical drivers of growth. 
31. 
I strongly believe that productivity and efficiency in banking services would be the 
bulwark  for  all  round  economic  development  in  India.5  There  have  been  definitive 
improvements  in  the  productivity  and  efficiency  parameters  in  the  banking  sector  in  India. 
However,  the  sector  has  only  witnessed  enhancements  in  operational  efficiency  and  the 
allocational  efficiency  has  suffered,  whereby  all  segments  of  the  society  have  not  really 
benefitted. 
32. 
Considering the challenges currently confronting the economy, there is little doubt 
that now is the time for the next big productivity push in Indian banking. There is a need for 
the entire paradigm of banking productivity and efficiency to be reoriented to be in alignment 
with our national priorities. 
Measures initiated by the government and RBI so far 
33. 
Let me recount some of the recent measures initiated by the Government and the 
Reserve Bank so far. Since the second week of September 2012, the Government of India 
announced a number of policy measures with the objective of strengthening the investment 
climate in the economy, which include, inter alia, the setting up of the Cabinet Committee on

changes in the natural gas pricing policy. The Government has also liberalised FDI norms in 
some more sectors including petroleum and natural gas refining, single brand retail trading,

Towards creating economic space, the Finance Minister, in Union Budget 2013–14, 
sought to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.8 per cent of GDP in 2013–14 from 5.2 per cent in the 
previous  year.  The  Budget  also  proposed  to  carry  forward  the  initiatives  to  boost 
infrastructure 
Infrastructure  Debt  Funds,  credit 
enhancement via IIFCL-ADB to infrastructure companies that may access the bond market, 
increase  in  the  aggregate  ceiling  of  issuance  of  tax-free  bonds  to  Rs.50,000  crore  in  
2013–14,  setting  up  a  regulatory  authority  for  the  road  sector  to  address  issues  such  as 
financial stress, enhanced construction risk and contract management. Furthermore, in order 
to  attract  new  investment  and  to  quicken  the  implementation  of  projects,  an  investment 
allowance  for  new  high  value  investments  was  introduced.  This  is  expected  to  provide 
enormous spill-over benefits to small and medium enterprises. 
36. 
To  reduce  the  CAD  to  sustainable  levels,  the  Reserve  Bank  and  Government  of 
India have taken various policy measures including, inter alia, (i) an increase in the customs 
duty  on  gold, (ii)  instructions  to  all  nominated  banks/nominated  agencies  to  ensure that  at 
least  one  fifth  of  every  lot  of  import  of  gold  (in  any  form/purity  including  import  of  gold 
coins/dore)  is  exclusively  made  available  for  the  purpose  of  export  and  (iii)  issuance  of 
inflation linked bonds to wean away investors from gold to other savings instruments.

The Prime Minister’s Office has been monitoring the CAPEX and investment plans 
of  selected  Central  Public  Sector  Enterprises  (CPSEs)  since  FY  12–13  with  a  view  to 
enhance investment in the economy and use CPSEs to drive economic growth. 
Developments in the banking sector 
Coming specifically to the banking sector, I would like to emphasize that this sector 
38. 
plays a very important role in the economic growth of the country, by providing finance to the 
different sectors of the economy. Though our banking system continues to remain vibrant in 
terms of capital and profitability, despite the economic downturn, we cannot afford to relax. 
While  the  asset  quality  of  the  banking  system  is  under  stress,  the  situation  is  still 
manageable.  Let  me,  however,  highlight  that  as  per  our  analysis,  the  higher  NPAs  in  the 
banking system are, in a large measure, also attributable to some laxity in lending standards 
in  the  benign  environment  that  preceded  the  Global  Financial  Crisis.  We  are  witnessing 
another disconcerting trend in our economy and that is the corporate sector and Government 
have become highly leveraged. The banks have to be more discreet in lending to the highly 
leveraged  corporates.  The  bank  credit  is  primarily  meant  to  be  utilized  for  productive 
purposes and hence, people cannot be allowed to eat credit. 
39. 
Specifically, there is lot of scope for improvement in our public sector banks in terms 
of governance, risk management capabilities and human capital. One of the primary reasons 
for  the  Financial  Crisis  was  the  greed  and  unethical  practices  of  the  market  participants. 
History bears testimony to the fact that an inefficient system breeds indiscipline, which in turn 
leads to wastage of resources, complacency, frauds, low growth, etc. Our banking system 
has to ensure that it remains efficient and supports the activities of the real sector. 
Message for Students 
40. 
I am wary of giving advice to the students as people of your generation are not too 
receptive to advices. So, I would just give you some suggestions. I would like to give three 
messages, which I always do whenever I get an opportunity to interact with the students. My 
first  message  is  that  you  must  strive  to  achieve  “third  generation  literacy”.  While  the  first 
generation  of  literacy  pertains  to  acquiring  knowledge  by  reading  books;  the  second 
generation literacy pertains to knowledge about computers and information technology. I am 
8 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
sure all of you have attained the first and second generation of literacy. However, the third 
generation of literacy that I am talking about is being “information literate”. What I mean is 
that you should always be aware of the things happening around you. You should be hungry 
to learn more and constantly update yourself by keeping your curiosity to seek and assimilate 
knowledge, alive. My second message to you is never be complacent in life. Think positive 
and avoid complacency. It is all the more important if you enter the financial sector, because 
few  moments  of  complacency  can  lead  to  disastrous  results.  In  fact,  when  I  am  asked, 
whether  I  am  concerned,  I  say  “Yes,  I  am”.  For  that  matter  even  RBI  governor  is  always 
concerned  because  people  in  the  financial  sector  and  those  dealing  with  money  cannot 
afford to be complacent even for a single moment. My third and final message is that, life is 
not a bed of roses and in your career you are bound to face some bad times. Also when the 
bad times come, they arrive from all directions. During this period you should lie low, do not 
get  desperate  and  pray  to  God,  for  good  times  are  bound  to  come  back  again.  You  will 
always  be  successful  in  your  life  and  professional  career,  if  you  follow  the  above  three 
commandments.  The  knowledge  you  have  acquired  at  this  institute  will  open  the  doors  of 
success for you in whichever field you choose. 
Conclusion 
41. 
Let me conclude by saying that not only our problems are much simpler than most 
nations;  we  are  also  well  aware  of  them.  We  have  a  growing  population  and,  hence,  we 
would  continue  to  have  a  base  level  of  growth  whatever  be  the  situation.  The  issue, 
therefore, is not to just “sustain” growth but to grow at our higher “potential” growth rate. To 
my  mind,  productivity  and  efficiency  enhancements  are  central  to  achieving  this  higher 
growth rate. We must not get bogged down by the fact that others are not really doing their 
part, nor should we wait for everything else to be in place before setting our house in order. 
Charity begins at home and hence, we should do what is within our capability irrespective of 
the constraints surrounding us. The society has to collectively demand probity, accountability 
and transparency in public life and develop strict intolerance towards indiscipline. 
42. 
I  would  once  again  like  to  thank  Narsee  Monjee  Institute  of  Management  Studies 
University and the faculty and students of the School of Business Management for inviting 
me  to  this  Conference  for  sharing  my  thoughts  on  a  topical  subject.  I  am  sure  the  bright 
young minds of the NMIMS would reflect on the issues that I have raised today and further 
deliberate and ideate on how India can regain its growth momentum in the coming days. As 
future  business  managers  and  potential  captains  of  the  industry,  you  carry  a  burden  of 
expectations of an entire nation. I believe with hard work, we would be able to overcome the 
adversities and return to higher growth trajectory sooner than others. I would like to end with 
a quote from an American Novelist, Nora Roberts which says “if you don’t go after what you 
want, you’ll never have it. If you don’t ask, the answer is always no. If you don’t step forward, 
you’re always in the same place”.

Thank You. 
I  wish  you  a  successful  Conference  today  as  well  as  success  in  all  your  future
