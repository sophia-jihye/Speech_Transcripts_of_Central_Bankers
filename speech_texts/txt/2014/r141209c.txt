  Fahad Almubarak: Top achievements of the monetary sector during the 
past decade 
Speech by H E Dr Fahad Almubarak, Governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, at 
the National Day, Riyadh, 25 September 2014. 
 Our beloved country is celebrating its 84th national day, which is very dear occasion to all of 
us.  The  march  of  welfare  and  building  continues  under  the  prudent  leadership  of  the 
Kingdom. SAMA’s employees are overwhelmed with happiness on this occasion in light of 
the  achievements  of  the  monetary  policy  by  focusing  on  the  interests  of  the  country  and 
citizens. 
SAMA’s  balanced  monetary  policy  has  contributed  to  strengthening  the  stability  of  the 
national economy during stages of global stress and turbulence. As a result, the credit rating 
of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been upgraded. Fitch upgraded the Kingdom’s sovereign 
credit rating to AA from AA- with a stable outlook. 
Over  the  past  ten  years,  the  banking  sector  witnessed  a  great  development  quantitatively 
and  qualitatively.  M3  rose  by  270  percent  to  SAR  1,669.3  billion  at  the  end  of  July  2014 
against an increase of SAR 451.3 billion at the end of July 2004. Total bank deposits also 
went up by 284.5 percent to SAR 1,520.6 billion in the same period. Total commercial banks’ 
claims on the private and public sectors grew by 193.3 percent to SAR 1,314.4 billion at the 
end  of  July  2014  compared  to  SAR  447.8  billion  at  the  end  of  July  2004.  All  these 
developments  contributed  to  the  growth  of  the  Kingdom’s  economy  and  enhanced  the 
stability of its financial sector. 
Domestic banks’ capital adequacy ratio (Basel Standard) stood at 17.8 percent at the end of 
the second quarter of 2014, exceeding the prescribed rate of 8 percent. In addition, stress 
tests conducted periodically by SAMA on commercial banks showed good results. 
Banking services witnessed further expansion throughout the Kingdom. Commercial banks’ 
branches increased by 53.8 percent to 1,862 at the end of July 2014, compared to 1,211 at 
the end of July 2004. 
In  recognition  of the  importance  of  using  latest  technological  developments  in  the  banking 
field,  SAMA  worked  with  domestic  banks  on  the  introduction  of  the  latest  secure  banking 
technology. In this regard, the value of transactions carried out through SARIE system picked 
up to SAR 54.6 trillion in 2013 from SAR 8.1 trillion in 2004. Moreover, the total number of 
transactions executed through ATMs went up to 1,335.5 million in 2013 from 412.1 million in 
2004.  During  the  same  period,  the  total  number  of  transactions  carried  out  through  POS 
terminals increased to 294.1 million with a total value of SAR 144.3 billion from 52.1 million 
with  a  total  value  of  SAR  23.9  billion.  The  number  of  bills  paid  through  SADAD  system 
increased to 160.8 million with a value of SAR 176.6 billion in 2013 from 43.5 million with a 
value of SAR 22.0 billion in 2007. 
Within  the  framework  of  its  supervisory  and  oversight  functions  over  the  insurance  sector, 
SAMA considered many files of insurance companies. By the end of 2013, SAMA licensed 
35 insurance and reinsurance companies. Besides, SAMA approved 194 offices to provide 
insurance related services. 
SAMA  issued  a  number  of  regulations  and  rules  to  regulate  the  activities  of  the  financing 
sector in the Kingdom, improve its services, promote governance and transparency, protect 
the rights of its beneficiaries and create a competitive environment to contribute to provision 
of better financing services to meet the needs of the market and beneficiaries at competitive 
prices. Up to the end of July 2014, SAMA licensed 12 banks and 4 companies to conduct the 
activity  of  real  estate  finance  and  financial  leasing,  and  4  companies  to  carry  out  other

  financing  activities.  SAMA  also  granted  initial  approvals  on  11  applications  for  licensing 
pending the completion of the legal requirements of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. 
At the international level, the Kingdom holds a prominent position. It is an active member of 
the  G20 since  its  establishment  and  of  several  international financial  organizations.  SAMA 
represents  the  Kingdom  in  a  number  of  international  forums  and  institutions,  such  as  the 
Bank  for  International  Settlements,  the  Financial  Stability  Board,  Basel  Committee,  the 
International Association of Insurance Supervisors, the Islamic Financial Services Board and 
the  Gulf  Monetary  Council.  Currently,  SAMA  is  participating  in  more  than  25  committees, 
working groups and sub-committees in international commissions and organizations. SAMA 
effectively  contributes  to  the  efforts  exerted  in  international  regulatory  reforms,  enabling 
SAMA to cope with the latest developments and international standards in supervision and 
control. 
On this occasion, I pray to Almighty Allah to preserve the security and stability of our country 
and  may  the  Kingdom’s  continue  its  development  march  under  the  wise  leadership  of  the 
Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince.
