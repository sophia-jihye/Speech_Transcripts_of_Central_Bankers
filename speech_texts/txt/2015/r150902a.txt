Introduction 
I. 
In this era of hyperglobalisation,1 are central banks still masters of their domestic monetary 
destinies?  Or  have  they  become  slaves  to  global  factors?  To  what  extent  does  a  global 
financial cycle dominate domestic transmission mechanisms and does that, as some might 
suggest, confer particular responsibilities on those central banks that most influence it? 
On  the  surface,  there’s  evidence  of  global  inflationary  cycles  that  correspond  with  an 
intensifying globalisation that propagates common shocks via commodity, trade and financial 
channels. Correlations of CPI are as elevated today as during the first oil shock and on the 
surface we appear to be in the midst of a highly synchronised global rates cycle. 
But as is often the case, appearances deceive. Correlations of headline CPI largely reflect 
price level shocks such as those to oil (Chart 1). Core inflation rates exhibit much less co-
movement  but  rather  vary  with  increasingly  divergent  underlying  economic  conditions 
(Chart 2). 
The stance of monetary policy reflects these differences. After adjusting for unconventional 
policy there’s greater monetary policy divergence than implied by a simple eyeballing of the 
currently highly synchronised global rates cycle. And there remains the prospect of a further 
widening. 
In  other  words,  domestic  economic  conditions  – conditions  affected  by domestic monetary 
policy – still very much matter. 
None of this diminishes the considerable challenges of returning inflation to target in the face 
of  global  developments.  There  are  profound  secular  and  cyclical  disinflationary  forces  at 
work in the global economy, and for economies like the UK their impact is being reinforced 
by  exchange  rate  movements  which  will  drag  inflation  down  further  at  the  policy  horizon. 
Moreover, as events of the past few weeks have reminded us, a variety of global factors can 
affect global financial conditions and influence the neutral rate of interest. 
Central banks must take these Disparate Confounding Dynamics (DCDs) into account when 
setting  policy.2  Even  for  those  economies  with  the  strongest  recoveries  and  the  best 
functioning  financial  systems,  they  mean  that  the  policy  rates  consistent  with  returning 
inflation to target will likely need to rise in a gradual fashion and to a limited extent despite 
robust  domestic  demand  and  firming  domestic  costs.  For  the  UK  at  least,  global  DCDs 
influence but do not dictate policy.

  Developments in global inflation 
II. 
The different balance of domestic and global forces across economies can be seen in the 
dispersion in underlying inflation outcomes since the Great Moderation. 
The  Bretton  Woods  system  collapsed  with  the  onset  of  the  Great  Inflation.  Cross-country 
inflation correlations rose sharply from close to zero for much of the 1960s to about ½ in the 
early 1970s as fiscal shocks were reinforced by the global oil price shock in the absence of 
nominal anchors. 
The eventual discovery of these anchors culminating in the widespread adoption of inflation 
targeting heralded disinflation, with a high degree of co-movement of inflation throughout the 
1980s and early 1990s, particularly at lower frequencies (Chart 3 – top two panels).3 
By  the  early  2000s,  inflation  resembled  random  variations  around  countries’  targets,  and 
cross-country inflation correlations fell – especially for core inflation. While the deflationary 
shock of the financial crisis and the rise and fall of the commodity super-cycle have boosted 
correlations of headline CPI, core inflation rates have actually become more dispersed. 
This evidence of domestic monetary sovereignty is remarkable given the ever stronger cross-
country links via commodity markets, goods and services trade, and financial channels. 
While  on  the  surface  the  response  to  the  major  shocks  of  the  past  decade  has  been  a 
common  rates  cycle  (Chart  3  –  bottom  panel),  the  reality  has  been  an  unprecedented 
broadening of monetary policy instruments and increased policy divergence. With the end of 
additional QE, policy in the US and UK has stopped easing and there is the prospect – when 
conditions warrant – of tightening. The start of normalisation is set against determined easing 
of  policy  in  the  euro  area  and  Japan  as  well  as  now  across  many  Emerging  Market 
Economies including China. 
Common linkages 
III. 
Global inflation dynamics are driven by common global linkages through commodities, trade 
and finance. 
Commodities 
The combination of the oil shock and the absence of credible monetary policy frameworks 
led to high and sustained correlations of headline inflation in the 1970s. And even though the 
oil  intensity  of  production  has  since  fallen,  commodity  price  shocks  remain  an  important 
determinant  of  the  global  inflation  landscape  today.4  Energy  and  food  prices  contributed 
around three percentage points to the global inflation spike at the onset of the crisis and are 
currently weighing on global inflation by around ½ percentage point (Chart 4).5 
However,  in  terms  of  policy  credibility,  the  contrast  with  the  1970s  is  stark.  As  noted, 
correlations  between  core  inflation  rates  today  remain  low;  and  with  credible  monetary 
regimes  anchoring  inflation  expectations,  policymakers  can  look  through  the  one-off  price 
level effects of oil shocks. 
In  the  UK,  for  example,  despite  several  months  of  zero  or  mildly  negative  inflation  rates, 
there  is  no  evidence  of the  development  of  a  deflationary  mindset  among  businesses  and 
                                                
3  Whether this was good luck or good policy is an open question but, for those of you who recall debates of 
Jackson Hole’s past, I’m minded to favour policy, particularly given post crisis performance. 
4  Energy consumption per dollar of GDP is now 45% lower in the US and 30% lower in Europe than it was in 
1980. 
5  Similarly in the UK, energy and food contributed over two percentage points to headline figure in late 2008, 
and is dragging by a litter over ½ percentage point in the latest data.

  households. Spending is picking up rather than being delayed. Consumer confidence is at its 
highest level in over decade and retail sales have been growing at well above past average 
rates. Firms’ investment intensions are robust. And inflation expectations remain consistent 
with our 2% target.6 
Trade 
Trade creates more complex global inflation dynamics. The ICT revolution has made a great 
unbundling  of  production  chains  possible,  and  large  wage  differentials globally  have  made 
doing  so  profitable.7  This  generated  vast  new  quantities  of  “supply  chain  trade”  (Chart 5), 
increasingly concentrated in Asia where, by the late 1990s, supply-chain trade had overtaken 
that of Europe, the US and Canada.8, 9 
All else equal, the powerful strengthening of global linkages through steadily increasing trade 
has affected inflation dynamics in two ways (Chart 6). 
First,  imports  have  become  much  more  important  components  of  costs.  Unlike  commodity 
shocks, changing cost pressures of intermediate goods take time to work through the supply 
chains  into  final  goods  prices.10  This  means  that  domestic  monetary  policy  cannot  focus 
exclusively  on  domestic  marginal  costs,  since  inflation  at  policy-relevant  horizons  is 
increasingly influenced by imported cost pressures. 
Second,  there  is  the  possibility  that  increased  competition  from  overseas  might  have 
changed mark ups over costs and how they vary over the cycle. In other words, the slope of 
the Phillips Curve may have changed. 
The direction is unclear. Stronger competitive pressures might reduce the pricing power of 
domestic  firms,  limiting  their  ability  to  change  prices  over  the  cycle  and  so  flatten  the 
domestic Phillips Curve. Working in the other direction however, greater competition should 
raise firms’ willingness to re-set their prices, raising the slope. The balance of these effects is 
an open question.11 
Some  prominent  studies  point  to  a  flattening  of  Phillips  curves  across  advanced 
economies.12 For the UK, however, the evidence is less clear cut. When costs are measured 
                                                
6  The average inflation expectations of professional forecasters at the two to three-year horizon is consistent 
with  its  historical  average.  And  measures  derived  from  financial  market  prices,  such  as  from  swaps,  also 
remain close to historical averages. 
7  Actually,  this  was  the  “second  unbundling”,  as  observed  by  Baldwin  (2013),  following  the  “first  unbundling” 
brought about by trade itself – which allowed the separation of production from consumption across time and 
space.  Baldwin,  R  (2013),  “Global  supply chains:  why  they  emerged,  why  they  matter,  and  where  they  are 
going”, Chapter 1 in Global Supply Chains in a Changing World, WTO.

margins, imported inputs, and trade exposure”, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 92. 
11  A flatter Phillips curve has been advanced as one of the potential explanations of ‘the missing disinflation’ we 
saw  in  some  countries  in  the  post-crisis  period.  But  other  factors  such  as  an  overestimate  of  the  level  of 
potential supply in the economy and the hold of well-anchored inflation expectations may also have been at 
work. 
12  For  example,  see  IMF  (2006)  “How  Has  Globalization  Affected  Inflation?, World  Economic  Outlook,  Spring 
2006,  97–134.  and  Borio,  Claudio  and  Andrew  Filardo,  “Globalization  and  Inflation,”  Bank  for  International 
Settlements, March 2006.

  properly – adequately weighting labour and import costs – a significant change in the Phillips 
curve slope is harder to detect.13 
Given the importance of imports to UK inflation, accounting for around one third of the CPI 
basket, the Bank of England must consider both secular and cyclical dynamics. As has been 
highlighted at previous symposiums, from a secular perspective, globalisation has dampened 
the relative prices of traded goods via a steady expansion in the pool of available labour. The 
entry of China, India and the ex-Soviet bloc into the world economy in the 1990s effectively 
and progressively doubled the global labour pool from 1.5 to 3 billion workers.14 
By  taking  the  implication  of  this  sustained,  cumulative  relative  price  shock  into  account, 
monetary  policy  has  been  able  to  deliver  desired  inflation  outcomes.  For  the  UK,  Chart 7 
shows that between 1998 to 2006, when core goods inflation averaged around –1.5%, the 
stance  of  policy  supported  3.7%  average  services  price  inflation  (which  was  largely 
determined by the evolution of domestic costs) in order to meet the inflation target. 
The questions now are how soon this process of integrating a global reserve army of labour 
will  have  run  its  course  and  whether,  as  services  become  increasingly  tradable,  this 
balancing act between domestic and global costs will become even more complex. 
Today,  on  top  of  these  secular  relative  price  trends,  policymakers  also  have  to  take  into 
account the cyclical disinflationary impulse from the weakness in overall global demand. Cost 
growth  is  subdued  in  many  economies,  reflecting  continued  slack  as  illustrated  by  the  co-
movement of an estimated world output gap with world core inflation – a glimpse of a “global” 
Phillips curve (Chart 8).15 
The  impact  of  these  forces  on  domestic  inflation  depends  crucially  on  movements  in  the 
exchange rate. In the face of purely nominal shocks, for example if foreign monetary policy 
were  excessively  tight,  disinflationary  impulses  from  abroad  could  be  expected  to  be 
dampened  by  an  exchange  rate  depreciation  acting  as  a  buffer.  But  today,  in  the  UK,  the 
exchange rate is reinforcing disinflationary impulses from abroad, with sterling appreciating 
by around 20% since early 2013. 
While the appropriateness of moves of this scale in sterling and of a similar magnitude in the 
dollar may be subject to debate, directionally they suggest real forces at work. One possible 
driver  could  be  the  speed  of  adjustment  of  different  economies  to  the  financial  crisis,  with 
those more flexible economies that took the more decisive action to fix their financial systems 
seeing the fastest recoveries and largest appreciations. 
For very open economies like the UK, with a high proportion of imports invoiced in foreign 
currencies,  persistent,  sizeable  moves  in  exchange  rates  matter  for  the  inflation  outlook.16 
The pass-through of exchange rate changes through the supply chain into UK CPI inflation is 
a  protracted  process,  indicative  of  rich  pricing  frictions  in  the  market  for  imported 
                                                
13  See  the  discussion  in  Greenslade,  J,  Millard,  S  and  Peacock,  C  (2008),  “How  has  globalisation  affected 
inflation dynamics in the United Kingdom?”, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Q3. Peacock and Baumann 
(2008) find evidence of a flattening of the UK Phillips Curve since the mid 1980s, conditional on treating the 
UK as a closed economy. When import prices are allowed to enter firms’ costs, however, the authors find no 
change in the Phillips curve slope comparing 1965-2007 and 1985-2007. Peacock, C and Baumann, U (2008), 
“Globalisation,  import  prices  and  inflation  dynamics”,  Bank  of  England  Working  Paper  No.  359.  Groen  and 
Mumtaz  (2008)  likewise  find  little  evidence  in  changes  in  the  structural  parameters  of  UK  Phillips  Curves.

  intermediate and final goods. These effects span the policy horizon, and therefore affect the 
appropriate stance of monetary policy.17 
In  order  to  counterbalance  the  scale  and  persistence  of  exchange  rate  movements,  UK 
monetary policy needs to support a continued firming in the growth of wages and unit labour 
costs. The stronger the drag from foreign cost pressures, the more domestic costs will have 
to run above past averages. 
Financial channels 
The increased integration of the global financial system has important implications for global 
and local inflation dynamics. Global financial cycles of the type described by Helene Rey at 
this  Symposium  two  years  ago  can  amplify  changes  to  the  monetary  policy  transmission 
mechanism through liquidity and credit creation and destruction. Financial crises and sudden 
stops can spread weakness and, on balance, disinflation. 
The global demand shock resulting from the global financial crisis was a dramatic and painful 
example  of  the  broader  phenomenon  of  increasingly  synchronised  changes  in  global 
financial conditions. 
At the core of the global financial cycle are globally-active banks, which are key propagators 
of financial conditions across borders. Looser financial conditions in banks’ primary funding 
markets,  normally  in  US  dollars,  can  encourage  a  build-up  of  leverage  and  translate  into 
increased cross-border lending and currency appreciation in the countries in receipt of the 
capital flows.18 
An issue at present is the possibility of these mechanisms working in reverse, perhaps in the 
face  of  a  tighter  US  policy  stance.  Capital  reversals  and  dollar  appreciation  could  tighten 
financial conditions globally, with a knock-on impact on the balance sheets of borrowers with 
currency mismatches.19,  20 Some have argued that this confers a particular responsibility on 
US policy makers. 
Yet  US  policy  is  not  the  sole  determinant  of  global  rates.  Many  recent  movements  in  US 
long-term government bond yields have appeared to be influenced by ECB monetary policy 
actions.21 This is in line with some recent evidence that funding conditions in other financial 
centres, notably the UK and the euro area, affect funding conditions globally and, therefore, 
the cross-border supply of funds.22 
Moreover, it is the divergence of monetary policies itself rather than the stance of one central 
bank  in  isolation  that  points  to  more  volatility  in  exchange  rates  and  asset  markets  with 
associated effects on global liquidity conditions.23 
                                                
17  Not surprisingly in light of its importance, issues related to pass-through are the subject of intense work at the 
Bank of England.

  Over  the  medium  term,  financial  reform  will  change  the  nature  of  this  cycle.  Once 
implemented, measures to end Too-Big-To-Fail should reduce the risk of extreme spillovers 
from failures of systemically important firms. Measures such as leverage ratios, higher capital 
charges  on  trading  books,  minimum  haircuts  for  repo  transactions,  central  clearing  of 
standardised  derivatives  should  all  dampen  endogenous  credit  creation  at  the  core  of  the 
system  and  thereby  limit  the  amplitude  of  the  global  financial  cycle.  Indeed,  the  dog  that 
hasn’t barked in the wake of recent market turbulence has been any hint of distress at any 
major financial institution. 
On the other hand, while the core of the system is more secure, the system as a whole is 
less able to provide on-demand liquidity. This reflects the impact of regulatory changes and 
changes  to  market  structures,  including  the  rise  of  algorithmic  trading  and  the  increased 
importance  of  asset  management.  Over  time  the  Bank  of  England  expects  high  liquidity 
premia to persist in normal market conditions to compensate for these developments.24 
The  final  important  global  financial  linkage  is  the  level  of  long-term  risk-free  interest  rates 
determined  in  global  capital  markets.  In  the  medium  to  long  term,  the  interest  rate  that 
domestic policymakers must set to meet their inflation targets and keep a balance between 
demand and supply is strongly influenced, through the integration of capital markets, by such 
global rates. 
These are the product of real global factors. For the past thirty years, a number of profound 
structural  changes  in  the  world  economy  have  pushed  down  on  the  level  of  world  real 
interest  rates  perhaps  by  as  much  as  450bps.  Researchers  at  the  Bank  of  England  have 
estimated a decomposition of these changes, suggesting, in declining order of importance: 
slowing potential growth, the rise in saving due to demographic forces; higher credit spreads, 
lower  desired  investment  given  a  lower  relative  price  of  capital,  changes  in  income 
distribution; excess saving in emerging markets, and declining public investment. Collectively 
these  factors  could  account  for  the  lion’s  share  of  the  450bp  fall  observed  in  the  past 
30 years and suggest that global real rates may remain low – perhaps around 1% – in the 
long term.25 
In the short run, the domestic real rate that balances demand and supply can deviate from 
this  long-term  global  level  reflecting  a  range  of  transitory  factors  –  including  demand  and 
supply  shocks  from  fiscal  policy,  credit  markets  and  exchange  rates.  It  is  critical  domestic 
policymakers judge the scale and persistence of these factors and take them into account to 
meet their domestic objectives. 
For  many  central  banks,  including  the  Bank  of  England,  these  factors  suggest  that  the 
“equilibrium”  real  rate  of  interest  –  the  rate  needed  to  keep  the  economy  at  potential  and 
inflation on target – which was sharply negative during the crisis, will slowly rise but remain 
lower than past averages for some time. 
Concluding remarks 
III. 
Recent developments in China can be assessed within this framework. 
First, to the extent to which lower Chinese demand for commodities imparts a positive terms 
of  trade  and  real  income  shock  on  the  UK  economy,  the  MPC  can  look  through  the 
temporary  disinflationary  impact  on  headline  inflation  and  concentrate  on  potentially  more 
persistent  effects  through  trade  and  financial  channels.  In  that  regard,  a  potential  further 
                                                
24   Monetary policy will have to adjust accordingly, as these developments likely imply a lower equilibrium real 
risk-free rate, compensating for the larger credit spread that results.

  material  slowing  of  growth  in  China  and  more  broadly  in  non-Japan  Asia,  particularly  if 
coupled  with  material  and  persistent  exchange  rate  depreciation,  could  impart  further 
imported disinflationary pressures over the policy horizon. In addition, a persistent tightening 
of domestic financial conditions as a consequence of increased global risk aversion could re-
introduce a headwind to growth and inflation over the medium term. 
These are possibilities, not certainties. Their evolution needs to be monitored, not taken for 
granted. And it should be recognised that the direct exposure of the UK economy to China is 
relatively modest and that the recent tightening of financial conditions comes on the heels of 
a prolonged period of sustained improvement. Moreover, realisation of some of a downside 
risk  previously  identified  by  the  MPC,  if  it  persists,  has  to  be  weighed  against  ongoing 
domestic  strength,  underpinned  by  credible  policy  regimes  and  an  increasingly  robust 
financial system. In this regard, developments in China are unlikely to change the process of 
rate increases from limited and gradual to infinitesimal and inert. 
Indeed, as I said recently, the prospect of sustained momentum in the UK economy and the 
gradual firming of underling inflationary pressures will likely put the decision as to when to 
start the process of gradual monetary policy normalisation into sharper relief around the turn 
of this year. To be clear, that opinion doesn’t prejudge any particular decision. But it does 
indicate  that  recent  events  do  not  yet,  to  my  mind,  merit  changing  the  MPC’s  strategy  for 
returning inflation to target – a strategy that already reflects the balance of two large gross 
effects:  namely  domestic  strength  on  the  one  hand  and  disinflationary  forces  from  the 
combination of the exchange rate and global weakness on the other. 
Members  of  the  MPC  will  continue  to  monitor  a  wide  range  of  indicators  of  domestic 
economic  momentum,  domestic  costs,  and  importantly  given  our  discussion  today,  the 
outlook for imported disinflation (as part of core CPI inflation amongst others) in determining 
the  precise  timing  and  path  for  Bank  Rate.  By  doing  so,  we  will  retain  our  monetary 
sovereignty in a globalised world.

 Notes:  Median  of  year-on-year  inflation  across  an  unbalanced  panel  of  up  to  64  countries  for  headline  inflation  and  up  to 
50 countries for core inflation. The swathes show the 15-85 percentile interval around the median. Core inflation refers to CPI 
excluding energy and food.

Notes: Average pairwise rolling (15 years) correlation of seasonally-adjusted quarterly headline and core inflation. 
The  country-specific  average  pairwise  correlation  of  a  time  series xi  in  country  i  (pcix)  is  the  average  of  the 
contemporaneous correlation between xi and xj for all i≠j. The average pairwise correlation (pcx ) is computed 
as the average of the pcix across all countries and, as such, provides a measure of international synchronization 
of 𝑥𝑥.

Note: The participation index adds together two components: the share of foreign value added embedded in a 
country’s exports (backward participation) and the share of exports made of domestic value added which is then 
subsequently used by an importing country to produce their exports (forward participation). For more information
