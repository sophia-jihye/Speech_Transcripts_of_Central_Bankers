  Fabio Panetta: The distributional consequences of monetary policy 
Remarks  by  Mr  Fabio  Panetta,  Deputy  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Italy,  at  the  Netherlands 
Bank, Amsterdam, 20 November 2015. 
 I wish to thank Piergiorgio Alessandri, Andrea Brandolini, Francesca Carta, Giuseppe Ferrero and Roberto Piazza 
for their help in preparing this text. 
Introduction 
1. 
Inequality  in  income  and  wealth  has  been  trending  upward  in  most  of  the  developed 
countries  in  recent  decades  (Figure  1).  The  magnitude  and  timing  of  the  increase  have 
varied  considerably  from  country  to  country;  the  rise  in  inequality  has  been  particularly 
pronounced  in  the  United  States  and  the  United  Kingdom,  possibly  because  of  the 
predominant role of capital markets in those economies (Figure 2). Although the trends most 
likely depend on a number of familiar drivers that are well identified in the literature – such as 
globalisation, skill-biased technological change, the rapid growth of the financial sector1 – the 
global financial crisis has brought monetary policy (MP) itself into the picture as a possible 
additional factor. 
The argument for this hypothesis runs as follows. Over the past seven years central banks 
have  adopted  unprecedented  expansionary  measures,  exploiting  both  conventional  and 
unconventional  policy  instruments.  If  monetary  policy  has  systematic  distributional  effects, 
and if monetary expansions redistribute resources “from the poor to the rich”, then MP may 
indeed now be contributing to or accelerating the long-run trends that we can observe in the 
data. 
Before going into this issue, it is important to recognise that if one examines inequality from 
the  global  perspective,  the  picture  is  very  different.  As  Figure  3  shows,  in  contrast  to  the 
trend  in  within-country  inequality,  since  the  1980s  international  inequality  has  diminished 
rather  than  intensified.2  What  is  more,  the  very  factors  that  increase  inequality  within 
countries can reduce inequality between them. This certainly holds for the structural drivers 
of  inequality,  such  as  globalisation.  Intriguingly,  it  may  be  true  of  monetary  policy  as  well. 
Research has found that a fall in interest rates in the United States stimulates cross-border 
credit flows and investment in the rest of the world, because it allows the large global banks 
to raise funds cheaply in the “core” of the financial system and invest them profitably in the 
“periphery.”3 Leaving aside the implications for financial stability, this means that the recent 
monetary expansions in the US and in Europe may have boosted income in relatively poorer 
parts of the world, thereby reducing between-country inequality. As ever, when we deal with 
inequality  we  must  be  careful  to  define the  phenomenon  and  the  constituency  we  have  in 
mind. 
Nevertheless,  many  central  banks  are  now  under  scrutiny,  with  questioning  of  the 
distributional implications of their policies “at home,” which makes the topic of this conference 
an important and timely one. Avoiding the discussion may do more harm to central bankers’

of  skilled  workers  in  the  “home  country”  through  a  Stolper-Samuelson  terms-of-trade  effect,  thereby 
accentuating inequality. Changes in production technology can have analogous effects if they result in a more 
than proportional rise in the productivity of (and demand for) such workers. The growth of finance may play a 
role if the financial sector generates abnormally high salaries.

  reputation  than  engaging  expressly  with  distributional  issues.  In  my  remarks  today  I  will 
examine two questions. The first one is positive, or descriptive: How should we think about 
the  distributional  implications  of  monetary  policy,  both  in  general  (Section  2)  and  within  a 
monetary union (Section 3)? The second is normative, or prescriptive: How, if at all, should 
central  banks  take  inequality  into  account  when  setting  the  course  of  monetary  policy 
(Section 4)? 
The complex distributional implications of monetary policy 
2. 
Quantitative easing (QE) and low interest rates have highly vocal critics on both sides of the 
Atlantic. These critics have pointed out that a policy aimed explicitly at lowering the yields on 
safe assets is a policy that necessarily hurts – even “expropriates” – ordinary savers. Ford 
and Vlasenko (2011) contended that “By lowering interest rates to historically unprecedented 
levels,  the  Fed’s  policy  has  deprived  savers  of  interest  income  they  normally  would  have 
earned on savings accounts […].”4 They have been echoed in Europe by the president of the 
German Savings Association, Georg Fahrenschon, who accused the ECB of, “stand[ing] for 
an  unprecedented  phase  of  low  interest  rates  that  expropriates  the  saver,  damaging  the 
savings culture and putting more and more pressure on the self-provisioning of people.”5 
This criticism emphasises the immediate effects of monetary policy on households’ interest 
income.  If  these  effects  were  to  dominate,  then  a  monetary  expansion  would  indeed  hurt 
savers  who  derive  a  significant  fraction  of  their  income  from  deposit-like  assets.6  We 
probably  all  agree  that,  ceteris  paribus,  low  interest  rates  and  high  inflation  tend  to  help 
borrowers  at  the  expense  of  lenders/savers.  But  that  “ceteris  paribus”  clause,  always 
debatable,  is  particularly  troublesome  in  this  context.  Indeed,  what  makes  the  foregoing 
criticism  fragile,  in  my  view,  is  that  it  relies  on  a  short-term,  partial  equilibrium  view  of 
monetary policy transmission. 
Focusing exclusively on the interests associated with deposits is mistaken: monetary policy 
can  generate  distributional  effects  through  a  number  of  other  income-  and  wealth-related 
channels,7 and if we are to determine how well grounded the criticisms are, we clearly need 
to develop a holistic view of how these channels work. 
First of all, monetary expansions normally raise the prices of some financial assets;8 there is 
ample evidence, in fact, that while QE has indeed compressed the yields on a range of long-
term bonds, it has raised the prices of shares.9 Second, looking beyond finance, real assets 
like housing are likely to play a key role. Research has demonstrated that monetary policy 
also works through real estate markets:10 by compressing both the short and long end of the 
yield curve, monetary easing typically stimulates mortgage lending and, as a consequence, 
boosts house prices.11 This channel might be particularly important for QE, whose express 
objective is to lower long-term interest rates.

6  The problem could be compounded by “segmentation” (à la Williamson, 2008): if economic agents differ in 
their ability to trade in financial markets, the benefits of an increase in liquidity will be reaped exclusively or 
primarily  by  those  who  have  better  access  to  the  markets  and  can  exploit  more  direct  relations  with  the 
monetary authority – which is to say, “banks”. 
7  See e.g. Coibion et al. (2012). 
8  Rigobon and Sack (2014).  
9  Clayes et al. (2015). 
10  Indeed,  some  studies  have  concluded  that  housing  debt  and  real  estate  wealth  play  a  crucial  role  in  the 
transmission mechanism – see e.g. Cloyne et al. (2015). 
11  Jordà et al. (2014) reach these conclusions with a dataset that spans 140 years and 17 countries.

  This  means  that  even  if  we  consider  only  direct  portfolio  effects,  we  should  conclude  that 
savers  do  not  necessarily  stand  to  lose  from  a  monetary  expansion:  those  who  own  real 
estate  and/or  a  sufficiently  diversified  portfolio  of  financial  assets  –  in  practice,  a  good 
proportion of all savers – may actually benefit in relative terms. As I will show presently, in 
the euro area housing is likely to be a particularly important factor. 
The  picture  is  complicated  still  further  if  one  takes  a  general  equilibrium  perspective. 
Expansionary  monetary  policies  designed  to  fend  off  deflation  and  stimulate  economic 
growth also generate higher real interest rates over the medium term.12 In other words, from 
a longer-term perspective the interest income channel would appear to work in the opposite 
direction to that posited by the critics. Since what really matters for savers is the real return 
on  their  savings  in  the  longer  run,  this  reading  may  well  be  more  persuasive  than  an 
exclusively short-term focus. 
Furthermore, if monetary expansions succeed in stimulating economic activity significantly, 
they will increase both labour income and corporate profits, which are ultimately distributed 
as  dividends  to  “savers”  too.  What  matters  for  inequality,  then,  is  the  combination  of  two 
factors. The first  is the sensitivity  of  labour  and  capital  income to  a monetary  intervention: 
wages may rise relatively more or less than corporate profits. This is likely to depend on a 
number  of  structural  features  of  the  economy,  including  the  share  of  labour  and  capital  in 
production  and  the  structure  of  the  labour  market.  The  second  factor  is  the  distribution  of 
labour and capital income across households. 
In this respect it is important to bear in mind that labour is the main source of income for the 
middle  classes.  Figure  4  gives  the  breakdown  of  income  sources  across  quintiles  of  the 
distribution in the United States, showing that even there, where households are more active 
in financial markets than in Europe, labour accounts for over half of total income in up to 80 
per cent of all households13 and that its share of total household income is highest for the 
third and fourth quintiles. Capital and business incomes generally account for a much smaller 
share; they are quantitatively significant only for the top income quintile. Thus if a monetary 
stimulus  sustains  employment  and  wages,  its  effects  will  benefit  a  very  large  part  of  the 
population and go relatively less to the top income groups. Furthermore, labour earnings at 
the bottom of the income distribution may be relatively more sensitive to the business cycle;14 
if this is the case, successful countercyclical MP might help low-income households above 
all, attenuating inequality. This suggests that monetary expansions could well decrease – not 
increase – inequality. 
This brief discussion suggests the considerable difficulty of determining the net distributional 
effect of a monetary policy intervention a priori. To me, this is primarily an empirical issue, in 
which the conclusion depends on a series of economic and institutional characteristics. And I 
think the difficulty stems mainly from the fact that it involves many dimensions that need to 
be considered jointly. 
Since monetary policy works through both income and wealth channels, at the very least one 
should examine their distribution in the population jointly and not singly. Figure 5 reports data 
on the ratio of debt service to income (DS-I) in the euro area from the Household Finance 
and  Consumption  Survey  (HFCS),  plotting  on  the  vertical  axis  the  fraction  of  households 
whose DS-I ratio exceeds the level shown on the horizontal axis. To distinguish the relatively 
poor  from  the  rich,  there  is  a  separate  curve  for  each  gross  income  quintile.  Low-income 
households clearly bear a much heavier burden of debt than their high-income counterparts. 
In the bottom quintile (yellow line), roughly four tenths face monthly debt payments of 40 per

13  The exception is households in the lowest quintile, for which transfers are more important.

 3 
  cent  or  more  of  gross  income.  This  fraction  drops  to  less  than  two  tenths  in  the  second 
income quintile (solid blue line), and is practically nil for the top quintile (dashed blue line). 
This ordering basically holds for pretty much all DS-I values. Furthermore, the curve for the 
bottom quintile is set sharply apart from the others: servicing debt, that is, is only a problem, 
practically, for the poorest group of households. 
This empirical regularity suggests that the anti-QE camp has put forward arguments that are 
not fully consistent with one another. Criticising QE at the same time for “hurting savers” (like 
the first set of quotations above) and for “helping the rich”15 becomes problematic if in reality 
these turn out to be two largely overlapping categories. 
In  conclusion,  it  seems  fair  to  say  that  our  understanding  of  the  relationship  of  monetary 
policy to inequality has lagged behind the mounting political debate on the issue. Bernanke 
(2015) proposed a simple “litmus test” to cut through our difficulties in forming a complete 
picture  of  the  effects  of  QE:  “If  the  average  working  person  were  given  the  choice  of  the 
status quo (current Fed policies) and a situation with both a weaker labour market and lower 
stock  prices  (tighter  Fed  policies),  which  would  he  or  she  choose?”  This  question  would 
appear to offer a fitting background to our discussion here today. 
Inequality in a monetary union 
3. 
In  the  euro  area,  the  debate  has  stressed  another  potential  distributional  spillover  of 
monetary  policy:  redistribution  of  resources  not  only  within  countries  but  also  between  the 
member  states  of  the  monetary  union.  Naturally,  the  effects  of  monetary  policy  on  the 
member states may well be asymmetric, and very strong views on the way the asymmetry 
works  in  this  particular  case  have  been  expressed.  To  cite  one:  “While  households  in 
countries strongly affected by the crisis are relieved, others, namely German households, are 
suffering from the very same measures.”16 
To the extent that within the cross section of households an expansion produces winners and 
losers  and  that  these  are  unevenly  distributed  across  countries,  monetary  policy  may  of 
course  also  reallocate  resources  across  national  borders.  To  be  sure,  in  a  fully  integrated 
economic union this would not be an issue. In the euro area it might be, though, because the 
lack of a common fiscal policy framework means there are no tools to neutralise the potential 
distributional effects of MP. 
However,  the  concerns  about  the  redistributional  effects  of  monetary  expansions  across 
euro-area  countries  reflect  an  oversimplified  representation  of 
the  monetary  policy 
transmission  mechanism.  In  fact,  understanding  these  cross-country  effects  is,  if  anything, 
even harder than grasping within-country effects. One difficulty is simply measurement. The 
data are not comparable across countries because of differences in the definitions of income 
and wealth, the way taxes are treated, the primary sources used, and often the processing of 
the data. Measuring income and wealth consistently in a large economic area is not easy.17 
And  where  the  status  quo  itself  is  measured  inaccurately,  gauging  the  impact  of  a  shock 
(monetary or otherwise) becomes problematic at best.18

16  Holzhausen and Sikova (2014). 
17  The  statistical  traditions  of  European  countries  can  differ  significantly:  some  rely  mostly  on  administrative 
archives, others on sample surveys, still others on a combination of the two. There are pros and cons to each, 
of course, but clearly these methodological differences can influence income comparisons. Furthermore, the 
experience  of  statistical  agencies  (including  our  central  bank  departments)  has  shown  that  input  data 
harmonisation is far more demanding than output data harmonisation.  
18  Going forward, however, there is no reason to be pessimistic. We have made notable progress in the past two 
decades  in  measuring  income,  which  should  serve  as  an  encouragement  to  improve  our  measurement  of

  The  most  serious  difficulties,  however,  are  conceptual.  There  are  many  forms  of  cross-
country  heterogeneity  that  have  to  be  taken  into  account  in  assessing  the  distribution  of 
gains and losses, and these are hard to bring together to form a unified picture. Clearly, as 
my  earlier  observations  indicate,  two  important  aspects  of  this  problem  are  the  balance 
between net borrowers and net savers and the rate of home ownership (see Section 2). The 
interaction  between  these  two  factors  is  also  relevant:  a  monetary  expansion  is  doubly 
beneficial  for  people  who  purchased  their  homes  with  a  mortgage,  because  it  brings  an 
appreciation of the value of the house and a decrease in the real cost of debt servicing. An 
equally  important  role,  lastly,  is  played  by  the  transmission  of  monetary  policy  through 
housing markets and the associated dynamics of house prices. In short, we would expect the 
recent  expansionary  monetary  policies  to  have  produced  the  greatest  benefits  for  the 
households who (i) are highly indebted, (ii) own a house, (iii) have a mortgage, and (iv) are in 
countries where real estate prices have risen significantly. 
All  four  of  these  characteristics  are  quite  heterogeneous  across  countries  within  the  euro 
area  either  structurally  or  conjuncturally  (in  the  recent  past).  Figures  6  and  7  portray  the 
composition of households’ portfolios in the area according to the HFCS released in 2013. 
Figure 8 shows real house price indices in the  same countries over the last decade. Debt 
levels vary significantly. They are extremely low, for instance, in Italy and in Austria, where 
households  accordingly  obtain  only  moderate  benefits  from  a  monetary  expansion;  they 
exceed  50  per  cent  of  total  net  worth  in  the  Netherlands,  where  by  this  metric  household 
leverage is far higher than in the US (Figure 6). On the asset side, on average non-financial 
assets account for a significantly greater share than in the US (Figure 6). They consist mainly 
of  primary  residences  (Figure  7),  although  additional  properties  are  also  quantitatively 
significant in Finland, Germany, Portugal and Spain, where they account for roughly 20 per 
cent  of  households’  total  assets.19  Finally,  in  some  countries,  such  as  the  Netherlands,  a 
fairly large fraction of the real estate portfolio is funded by mortgage loans (Figure 7). If you 
were  to  use  these  data  to  form  a  rough  view  of  who  might  have  been  a  relative  winner 
(“plus”) or a loser (“minus”) from expansionary MP, you would obtain the following picture: 
• 
Italian households have low debt (minus); they hold a relatively large share of non-
financial assets, including housing (plus), but they experienced a decline in house 
prices from 2010 onwards (minus). 
German and Austrian households, who have comparably low debt levels (minus), 
hold a relatively smaller housing stock (minus) but make relatively more use of debt 
to  fund  their  real  estate  purchases  (plus),  and  enjoyed  a  significant  rise  in  house 
prices  (plus),  possibly  because  of  more  powerful  transmission  of  the  monetary 
stimulus in the euro-area “core” than in the “periphery.”20 
In  the  Netherlands,  debt  levels  are  extremely  high  (plus),  housing  ownership  is 
significant (plus), and mortgages play an even more important role than in Austria or 
in Germany (plus). House prices dropped, but the fall – which began in 2009, well 
before the start of the ECB’s aggressive policies – was arguably due to the bursting 
of  a  bubble. Insofar  as  it  was  successful  in  smoothing this  downward  adjustment, 
QE may have generated larger gains here than elsewhere (though of course they 
cannot be measured without formulating a “no-QE” counterfactual hypothesis). 
                                                                                                                                                     
wealth as well. Accordingly, from the beginning we have supported the Eurosystem’s collection of better data 
through the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. 
19  The difference matters, because the appreciation of a second home, or a property that has been purchased 
specifically for investment purposes, can be more readily turned into cash. 
20  In the “core” of the area MP had a direct impact on the borrowing costs ultimately faced by households; in the 
“periphery”, by contrast, costs were heavily affected by country-, bank- and borrower-specific risk premia.

  The  signs  are  conflicting,  and  conclusions  accordingly  hard  to  draw.  Clearly  if  we  move 
further  towards  the  “general  equilibrium”  view  that  I  advocated  earlier,  the  complexity  only 
increases. As Figure 9 shows, European equity markets too have displayed widely divergent 
patterns over the last few years. In Italy and Austria prices are hovering around their levels of 
five  years  ago,  while  the  German  and  Dutch  markets  have  rebounded  and  are  now  25  to 
50 per  cent  higher  than  in  2010.  As  we  know,  national  labour  market  dynamics  have  also 
differed greatly. This heterogeneity reflects a number of structural and cyclical factors, but it 
probably also depends on asymmetries in the transmission of monetary policy. 
In  conclusion,  as  soon  as  we  move  beyond  the  initial,  naïve  borrowers-versus-savers 
dichotomy  we  find  that  identifying  the  “winners”  in  the  euro  area  becomes  an  extremely 
difficult task. 
4. 
Two good reasons for central banks to care about inequality, and an excellent 
one to study it: it shapes the transmission mechanism 
Given  how  little  we  know  about  the  distributional  implications  of  monetary  policy,  central 
banks  should  certainly  not  think  of  attenuating  inequality  as  an  additional  implicit  policy 
objective. But this does not mean that they can – or should – simply ignore the issue. There 
are at least three reasons why, on the contrary, we must take it seriously. 
First  of  all,  a  central  bank  that  fails  to  take  the  redistributional  effects  of  its  decisions  into 
account will also be missing some aspects of the transmission mechanism, and may be less 
effective in pursuing its macroeconomic and financial stability objectives. 
We ordinarily assume that the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy relies on 
two mechanisms: nominal rigidities (by changing nominal interest rates the central bank is 
able to affect real interest rates and real wages) and intertemporal substitution (a fall in real 
rates increases aggregate demand by stimulating consumption and investment). These may 
indeed  play  a  central  role  in  a  representative-agent  world,  but  thinking  in  terms  of 
representative agents is not sufficient. 
In reality, there are many forms of heterogeneity among households that can have a strong 
influence on the transmission mechanism. One is the distribution of housing and mortgage 
debt in the population. Households with mortgages to pay appear to adjust their consumption 
significantly  after  an  unexpected  change  in  interest  rates,  whereas  renters  and  outright 
home-owners are far less sensitive.21 Another one is demographics. By increasing inflation, 
an  expansionary  monetary  shock  reduces  the  real  value  of  retirement  accounts.  This 
generates a negative wealth effect for the “old” while at the same time creating an incentive 
for the “young” to work harder and save more.22 These mechanisms may operate even in the 
absence of nominal rigidities. Although their quantitative impact is still being studied, it should 
be clear by now that it is not wise to ignore them altogether. 
From this perspective, the structure of household incomes and asset portfolios (and hence 
the inequality of wealth and income) is only one of the multiple forms of heterogeneity that 
central banks should and normally do monitor in order to understand how their policy tools 
work and to carry out their policy mandate more effectively. 
The  second  reason  is  that  complacency  might  take  central  banks  down  a  path  leading 
ultimately  to  the  loss  of  independence.  If  a  side-effect  of  monetary  policy  decisions  is 
increasing inequality to a socially unsustainable level, the government may decide to act to 
rein this trend in; such action could include pressuring the central bank to behave differently, 
or even curtailing its independence.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  A  third,  admittedly  more  speculative  reason  has  to  do  with  hysteresis.  Imagine  a  world  in 
which monetary policy increases inequality, leading to an excess of savings (“saving glut”) 
that  drives  the  natural  real  interest  rate  steadily  down.  With  a  lower  natural  rate,  all  else 
equal, the probability of hitting the zero lower bound is greater. This may heighten the danger 
of slipping into a period of persistent low interest rates, low inflation, low growth, and greater 
inequality. In this way the original policy action can have a permanent impact on future policy 
choices  and  on  the  CB’s  ability  to  discharge  its  mandate.  This  example  is  speculative,  of 
course,  but  it  illustrates  a  problem  that  may  deserve  more  attention:  insofar  as  monetary 
policy affects inequality and, additionally, shocks to inequality do not revert quickly, today’s 
monetary policy actions can have feedback effects over periods stretching well beyond the 
“medium term” as central banks generally define this concept. 
Conclusions 
fiscal  measures  designed  and 
5. 
Inequality is unquestionably a crucial dimension of public policy. Every society has views on 
how resources should be distributed among citizens, and democratic governments have the 
duty to give substance to those views. And even if the crucial ethical aspects of this problem 
could  be  neglected  (but  they  should  not),  the  implications  of  mounting  inequality  for 
economic  stability  and  prosperity  would  be  a  compelling  reason  to  take  the  phenomenon 
very seriously. High inequality can hinder growth, sow the seeds of financial crisis or prompt 
social unrest.23 
As a consequence, how monetary policy affects the distribution of income and wealth within 
the economy is an important question. Unfortunately, we know very little about it. Given the 
state of the art, it would appear inappropriate – or at best premature – to treat distributional 
outcomes  as  an  additional  objective  for  central  banks  (prioritising  interventions  that 
supposedly  reduce  inequality),  or  even  as  a  constraint  on  the  pursuit  of  their  primary 
objectives (say, by precluding interventions that strengthen macro-financial stability but may 
have  unwanted  distributional  effects).  In  this  sense  inequality  is,  and  should  remain,  the 
domain  of 
implemented  by  democratically  elected 
governments. This is especially true in a monetary union where fighting inequality may imply 
redistribution across countries. Monetary authorities lack the knowledge, the tools and most 
importantly the political legitimacy to act directly on the distribution of income and wealth. 
This is not to deny that the actions of central banks can carry distributional implications, or 
that these may be inconsistent with the preferences of the public. In thinking about this issue, 
it  may  be  helpful  to  draw  an  analogy  with  other  realms  in  which  public  policy  makers 
systematically take decisions that are welfare-improving but have undesirable distributional 
implications.  A  prime  example  is  environmental  policy.  Any  measure  that  encourages  the 
exploitation  of  renewable  energy  sources  (as  by  subsidising  wind  and  solar  power)  will 
generate  an  international  redistribution  of  income  away  from  oil  and  coal  producers; given 
that  some  of  these  are  not  “rich”  in  relative  terms,  such  a  reallocation  may  well  increase 
international or inter-regional inequality. Yet no one would criticise a “green” policy agenda 
on  these  grounds.  If  anything,  the  issue  is  how  to  control  this  redistribution  and  build 
international  consensus  for  a  reform  that  aims  to  improve  welfare  on  a  global,  world-wide 
basis. Another example is major infrastructural projects that benefit the broader community 
but are detrimental to local residents (the costs being measured in terms of well-being, not 
money: no one wants to live next to an airport or a highway). Once again, these tensions are 
ordinarily resolved by compensating the people who must bear the costs of the project with 
additional  distributional  interventions  (for  instance,  by  building  schools  and  amenities  to 
accompany roads or airports). Why should the distributional spillovers of monetary policy be 
treated differently?

  For researchers, the task today is to provide policy makers with more information and more 
tools to deal with the interplay between monetary policy and the distribution of income and 
wealth.  In  this  regard,  the  renewed  interest  in  the  transmission  of  monetary  policy  in 
economic models with heterogeneous agents is particularly welcome. To further this effort, 
the Bank of Italy, together with the CEPR, is organising a conference on “Monetary policy 
after the crisis” next June in Rome. The conference is intended to stimulate discussion on 
how our conventional wisdom on the transmission mechanism should be revised, in order, 
for one thing, to take heterogeneity into account. 
For monetary policy makers, on the other hand, the main task is to keep from getting carried 
away by superficial debates before that information becomes available. It is hard to deny that 
right now, ideology counts for more than objective science in the debate. We of the central 
banking  community  should  do  everything  we  can  to  ensure  that  this  trend  is  inverted  as 
quickly as possible.
