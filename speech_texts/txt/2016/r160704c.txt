  Mark Carney: Uncertainty, the economy and policy 
Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial 
Stability Board, at the Bank of England, London, 30 June 2016. 
 Today  I  want  to  discuss  what  uncertainty  means  for  the UK’s  economic  performance,  and 
how the Bank of England can best respond to it. 
The result of the referendum is clear. Its full implications for the economy are not.  
The  UK  can  handle  change.  It  has  one  of  the  most  flexible  economies  in  the  world  and 
benefits  from  a  deep  reservoir  of  human  capital,  world-class  infrastructure  and  the  rule  of 
law. Its people are admired the world over for their strength under adversity. The question is 
not whether the UK will adjust but rather how quickly and how well. 
Nonetheless, the decision to leave the European Union marks a major regime shift. In the 
coming years, the UK will redefine its openness to the movement of goods, services, people 
and capital. In tandem, a potentially broad range of regulations might change. 
Uncertainty over the pace, breadth and scale of these changes could weigh on our economic 
prospects for some time. While some of the necessary adjustments may prove difficult and 
many will take time, the transition from the initial shock to the restructuring and then building 
of the UK economy will be much easier because of our solid policy frameworks.  
At  times  of  great  uncertainty,  households,  businesses  and  investors  ask  basic  economic 
questions. Will inflation remain under control? Will the financial system do its job? Will I keep 
mine?  
Such  issues  are  why  monetary  and  financial  stability  are  fundamental  pre-requisites  for 
effective economic adjustment and sustained prosperity. 
Discharging  the  Bank’s  responsibilities  for  these  public  goods  demands  rigorous  analysis, 
objective  judgement,  and  effective  transparency.  We  will  not  shirk  from  these  obligations. 
The Bank and its independent policy committees will continue to provide analytically based, 
clear-eyed assessments of the economic and financial outlooks. And we will outline the risks 
to these forecasts so that we and others can prepare to manage them.  
The  near-term  challenges  facing  the  UK  economy  can’t  be  wished  away.  But  they  can  be 
addressed.  A  clear  plan  is  needed,  and  its  measures  must  be  implemented  with  resolute 
determination. After briefly reviewing the relationship between uncertainty and the economy, 
I  want  to  review  how  the  Bank  of  England’s  contribution  to  that  plan  will  unfold  over  the 
coming weeks.  
But at the outset, I want to re-emphasise that the Bank has taken all the necessary steps to 
prepare for these events. And we will not hesitate to take any additional measures required 
to meet our responsibilities as the United Kingdom moves forward. 
Bad things come in threes: geopolitical, economic, and policy uncertainty 
1. 
Before  expanding  on  what  the  Bank  can  do,  I  would  like  to  apply  some  rigour  to  the 
relationship between uncertainty and economic performance.1  
                                                 
1   Formally,  “risk”  and  “uncertainty”  are  distinct  –  one  being  quantifiable  with  probabilities,  either  physical  or 
subjective, and the other not. Economic theorists have discussed and modelled this distinction at least since 
Knight (1921). The empirical literature in macroeconomics tends, however, to elide this distinction somewhat, 
attempting formally to measure “uncertainty” by constructing indices mentioned in the text that probably also 
capture some elements of “risk”. Knight, F (1921), Risk, uncertainty, and profit, Boston.

Science, including social science, begins with measurement. Although imperfect, there are at 
least three distinct types of uncertainty that influence economic performance.2 
The first is geopolitical uncertainty. It doubled after 9/11 and remained elevated and volatile 
for  years  afterwards  (Chart  1).3  After  settling  in  the  wake  of  the  global  financial  crisis, 
geopolitical risk spiked with the passing of the Arab Spring and the rise of tensions in Eastern 
Europe.  
The second class of uncertainty – economic – is probably the most familiar. 
In recent years, economic uncertainty has been elevated because of fragilities in the financial 
system and overhangs of public and private debt. 
These challenges have been compounded by deeper forces that have radically altered the 
balance of saving and investment in the global economy.4 In the process, these have moved 
equilibrium interest rates into regions that monetary policy finds difficult to reach. Whether called 
“secular stagnation” or a “global liquidity trap”, the drag on jobs, wages and growth is real.  
Chart 1

Less visible, but more fundamental drivers of economic uncertainty are the powerful forces 
arising from technology and globalisation. The integration of 40% of humanity into the global 
economy  has  re-orientated  production,  eliminated  jobs  and  may  have  depressed  wages. 
These  dynamics  have  been  accompanied  by  the  implications  of  technology  for  the 
                                                 
2   These  are  distinct  from  other  types  of  uncertainty  familiar  to  economists,  including  model  uncertainty 
(uncertainty about the empirical properties of models as descriptions of the world), or to policymakers, such as 
the long and variable lags involved in the effects of monetary policy.  
3   Economists  have  recently  attempted  its  measurement  by  examining  the  frequency  of  newspaper  articles 
containing  terms  like  “geopolitical  tensions”,  “terrorist  threats”,  and  “war  risks”  in  a  sample  of  global 
newspapers. See Caldara, D and Iacoviello, M (2016), “Measuring geopolitical risk”, Federal Reserve Board, 
mimeo. Political scientists have also constructed similar measures though, it seems, at lower frequency. For 
an application see for example Berkman, H., B. Jacobsen, and J. B. Lee (2011), “Time-varying rare disaster 
risk and stock returns”, Journal of Financial Economics 101 (2).  
4   These include demographics, inequality, lower public investment, saving in emerging markets, higher credit 
spreads, cheaper capital goods, and lower trend growth. See Rachel, L and Smith, T (2015), “Secular drivers 
of the global real interest rate”, Bank of England Staff Working Paper.

automation  of  jobs  and  of  trade  for  their  location;  and  the  consequences  of  bigger,  more 
global markets for “winner takes all” patterns of compensation.  
These  secular  trends  can  be  reinforced  by  more  cyclical  moves  (Chart  2).5  Cyclical 
economic uncertainty spiked during the crisis, remained very subdued until last autumn, and 
has since been on the rise. 
The  last  of  the  uncertainty  trinity  is  policy  uncertainty.6  It  is  reduced  when  there  are  clear 
policy  remits,  frameworks,  and  institutional  structures  that  empower  and  discipline  fiscal, 
monetary  and  regulatory  authorities.  It  is  elevated  when  these  are  absent.  And  it  is 
influenced  by  the  effectiveness  of  the  tools  available  to  central  banks,  the  clarity  of  their 
policy strategies and, crucially, the transparency of their communications. 
UK economic uncertainty spiked after the failure of Lehman Brothers

 In  recent  years,  policy  uncertainty  has  increased  globally.  In  some  jurisdictions,  fiscal 
frameworks  have  been  questioned;  in  others,  exchange  rate  regimes.  And  with  very  low 
interest  rates  and  expanding  unconventional  policies,  the  efficacy  of  monetary  policy  itself 
has  been  questioned.  The  charge  that  central  banks  are  out  of  monetary  ammunition  is 
wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be 
well aimed. 
Indices  of  policy  uncertainty  are  about  1¼  times  their  pre-crisis  averages  in  the  US  and 
Japan, and as high as three times in China. In the UK, progress since the financial crisis has 
been more than totally unwound this year with the measure having risen to five times its pre-
crisis average by the start of the official referendum campaign (Chart 3).  
                                                 
5   A closely watched measure of economic uncertainty – the VIX – spiked when the global financial crisis hit. 
Measures  that  combine  this  with  other  sources  of  economic  uncertainty,  such  as  dispersion  among 
forecasters’ growth projections, households’ unemployment expectations, and currency volatility, show clear 
variation over time, and rise at times of economic stress. See Haddow, A, Hare, C, Hooley, J and Shakir, T 
(2013)  “Macroeconomic  uncertainty:  what  is  it,  how  can  we  measure  it  and  why  does  it  matter?”,  Bank  of 
England Quarterly Bulletin, Q2. 
6   One way some of this has been measured is again to count occurrences in media articles of references to 
economics, uncertainty, and policy terms like “deficit”, “regulation” or terms relating to monetary policy. See: 
Baker, S, Bloom, N and Davis, S (2015), “Measuring economic policy uncertainty”, NBER Working Paper No. 
21633, October.

While clearly these three uncertainty measures are related, distinct movements are visible. 
The heady days of the Great Moderation were restrained by geopolitical uncertainty. During 
the financial and euro crises, by contrast, economic uncertainty dominated. And from 2012 
onwards,  with  the  abatement  of  the  acute  phase  of  the  euro-area  crisis,  economic 
uncertainty began to fall back, only to be replaced by renewed geopolitical tensions and now 
sharply higher policy uncertainty (Chart 4).

    What do the combined effects of uncertainty mean? 
2. 
All  this  uncertainty  has  contributed  to  a  form  of  economic  post-traumatic  stress  disorder 
amongst households and businesses, as well as in financial markets – that is, a heightened 
sensitivity  to  downside  tail  risks,  a  growing  caution  about  the  future,  and  an  aversion  to 
assets or irreversible decisions that may be exposed to future “disaster risk”.7  
There may be an affect heuristic at work. Put simply, long after the original trigger becomes 
remote,  perceptions  endure.  They  become  embedded  in  economic  narratives  and  their 
salience persistently affects risk perceptions and economic behaviour. 
This point is not trivial. Research has shown that people who have experienced low returns 
throughout their lives, like the “Depression Babies” of the 1930s, report lower willingness to 
take financial risk, are less likely to participate in the stock market, invest a lower fraction of 
their assets in equities, and are more pessimistic about future returns.8 
Today,  uncertainty  has  meant  an  inchoate  sense  of  economic  insecurity  for  many  people 
despite  generalised  economic  prosperity.  Across  the  advanced  economies,  employment 
appears less secure, wages more subdued, and inequality more pronounced.  
And its precautionary effects can mean spending is deferred because there is often a real 
option  value  to  waiting.9  Firms  delay  investment  decisions.  Investors  seek  safe  returns. 
Households put off buying durables. The common thread is that any economic decision that 
requires finance, has a sunk cost, or an uncertain payoff, is affected.  
While  the  effect  on  output  is  clearly  negative,  the  effect  on  inflation  is  ambiguous. 
Uncertainty’s  stultifying  effects  weigh  on  employment  and  aggregate  demand,  creating 
disinflationary pressures, while the freeze in resource reallocation can hold back productivity 
and aggregate supply, creating inflationary pressures.10 11 Higher uncertainty can also mean 
investment responds more sluggishly to demand stimulus.12

10   Bloom  (2009)  shows  how  economic  uncertainty  reduces  the  shrinkage  of  low  productivity  firms  and  the 
expansion  of  high  productivity  firms,  reducing  the  reallocation  of  resources  towards  more  productive  units.

growth  and  industries’  productivity  growth.  Bloom,  N  (2009),  “The  impact  of  uncertainty  shocks”,

We have seen the consequences of these effects in financial markets for some time. How 
are these dynamics manifest today? 
First,  there  has  been  serial  disappointment  in  corporate  earnings  (Chart 6).  The  failure  of 
past  relationships  to  reassert,  especially  rates  of  productivity  growth,  has  embedded  a 
growing sense of uncertainty in markets about the fundamentals upon which future prosperity 
will be built.

Second, the equity risk premium has risen sharply (Charts 7 and 8). Low earnings growth 
can account for some of this.13 But so does higher risk aversion as investors seek the safety 
of bonds partly as a hedge against extremes.

The  serial  disappointment  in  earnings  growth  is  mirrored  in  global  growth  since  the  crisis 
(Chart  9).  In  advanced  economies,  uncertainty  appears  to  be  holding  back  spending, 
particularly by corporates. Globally, investment remains weak (Charts 10 and 11). In the UK, 
relatively strong business investment growth in the past few years has only restored it to a 
level still shy of its pre-crisis share of GDP (Chart 12), and it is tracking below past cycles 
(Chart 13).  
                                                 
13   A fall in expected growth rates will tend to push down on expected future earnings, lowering equity prices and 
increasing the equity yield. At the same time, a fall in growth expectations will tend to be reflected in a lower 
expected path of risk-free rates, pushing down on bond yields.  So a decline in growth expectations will tend to 
widen the spread between equity and bond yields. Since equity prices depend on earnings expectations at all 
future  horizons,  the  equity  yield  (and  hence  the  equity-bond  yield  spread)  will  be  particularly  sensitive  to 
expectations about growth rates at long horizons

The  Monetary  Policy  Committee’s  May  forecast  incorporates  some  of  these  uncertainty 
effects. Our projection for the global economy was for 2016 growth of just 3%, the slowest 
pace  since  2009.  Domestically,  we  expected  growth  to  slow  to  2%  in  2016,  partly  as  a 
consequence of an increasing drag from uncertainty.  
Specifically, in May the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) estimated that the pick-up in UK 
economic uncertainty it had recently seen would lower our GDP by around 0.7% after a year. 
While  material,  this  was  less  than  suggested  by  past  relationships  partly  because  our 
projections  were  conditioned,  by  convention,  on  a  vote  to  remain  in  the  EU,  suggesting 
uncertainty would fade smartly after the referendum.  
Even before 23rd June, we observed the growing influence of uncertainty on major economic 
decisions.  Commercial  real  estate  transactions  had  been  cut  in  half  since  their  peak  last 
year.  Residential  real  estate  activity  had  slowed  sharply.  Car  purchases  had  gone  into 
reverse.  And  business  investment  had  fallen  for  the  past  two  quarters  measured.  Given 
otherwise  accommodative  financial  conditions  and  a  solid  domestic  outlook,  it  appeared 
likely that uncertainty related to the referendum played an important role in this deceleration. 
It  now  seems  plausible  that  uncertainty  could  remain  elevated  for  some  time,  with  a  more 
persistent  drag  on  activity  than  we  had  previously  projected.  Moreover,  its  effects  will  be 
reinforced  by  tighter  financial  conditions  and  possible  negative  spill-overs  to  growth  in  the 
UK’s major trading partners.  
In sum, the material slowing in growth that the MPC had identified as a risk associated with 
the referendum now looks likely to be our central forecast. Using reports from our nationwide 
network  of  agents,  private  survey  evidence,  and  hard  data,  in  the  coming  weeks  we  will 
estimate the extent of the deceleration as we formulate our August projections. 
Policies in an uncertain world 
3. 
When uncertainty is high, policymakers should have three objectives. First, conduct a sober, 
objective assessment of the outlook and the risks to it. Second, develop and communicate a 
plan  to  reduce  those  risks  and  to  seize  new  opportunities.  And  third,  do  no  harm,  by

minimising  any  possible  confusion  about  the  commitment  to  core  macroeconomic  policy 
frameworks themselves.  
In Tim Geithner’s famous dictum, “plan beats no plan.” And in my experience, a plan that is 
clearly articulated and transparently executed is best of all.  
A plan for the UK’s current challenges would include a comprehensive strategy for engaging 
with  the  EU  and  the  rest  of  the  world  –  including  clarifying  the  UK’s  future  trading 
arrangements, calibrating its openness to migration, ensuring the continuity of capital flows, 
and confirming the appropriate regulatory framework for the UK financial system.  
The  impact  of  concrete  progress  towards  these  objectives  would  be  amplified  by  an 
overarching, positive and animating narrative for growth in  a post-Brexit world. To  emerge 
from an uncertain world with confidence, people and businesses need a fixed point by which 
to navigate. Once identified, everyone can then play a role supporting the strategy to get us 
to our destination. 
That strategy must be grounded in the bedrock of the UK’s existing macro policy institutions 
and  frameworks.  That  means  fiscal  policy  anchored  in  a  clear  commitment  to  long-run 
sustainability and buttressed by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility.  
And it means respecting the frameworks for the other major arms of macroeconomic policy 
as they are set out in statute and conducted by the Bank of England. The Bank has clear 
remits and can deploy a wide range of instruments. With its goals defined by Parliament, the 
Bank has operational independence. Its policy strategies and communications are decided 
by  independent,  expert  committees  whose  members  are  individually  accountable  to 
Parliament for their analysis and policy actions.  
The Bank conducts policy consistently, transparently and accountably. Its policy committees 
are  straight  with  the  British  public  about  the  risks  and  trade-offs  in  the  pursuit  of  our 
objectives.  
This  institutional  framework  is  critical  to  reduce  uncertainty  and  essential  to  promote 
prosperity. 
With this backdrop, let me now describe the concrete steps the Bank has taken to address 
uncertainty and how we can be expected to act in the weeks and months ahead. 
Financial policy 
3.1 
Let me begin with financial policy. The Bank of England realised long ago that banks had 
been  woefully  undercapitalised  in  the  run-up  to  the  crisis  and  needed  to  build  significant 
resources in order to serve the real economy in a risky and uncertain world. 
The reforms have been enormous, with the capital requirements of our largest banks now ten 
times higher than before the crisis. 
Moreover,  the  Bank  has  stress  tested  our  major  banks  and  building  societies  against 
scenarios  far  more  severe  than  the  country  currently  faces.  In  fact,  our  2015  stress  test 
entailed losses twice those experienced during the financial crisis.  
At  its  last  meeting  in  March,  the  Financial  Policy  Committee  (FPC)  “assessed  the  risks 
around  the  referendum  [were]  the  most  significant  near-term  domestic  risks  to  financial 
stability.” 14  
Because we took the risks seriously in advance, the Bank could draw upon its supervisory 
expertise, its market operations, and its macroeconomic analysis to put in place a range of 
effective contingency plans.

These measures reinforce the significant steps we have taken over the past several years to 
enhance the resilience of the financial system. 
As a result of all these actions, UK banks have raised over £130bn of capital, and now have 
more than £600bn of high quality liquid assets. 
And as a backstop, in order to support market functioning, the Bank of England continues to 
stand ready to provide more than £250bn of additional funds through its normal facilities.  
As a further precaution, reflecting the possibility that heightened uncertainty may last a while 
longer, today the Bank of England is announcing that it will continue to offer Indexed Long-
Term  Repo  operations  on  a  weekly  basis  until  end-September  2016.  This  will  provide 
additional flexibility in the Bank’s provision of liquidity insurance over the coming months.  
These  facilities  provide  an  effective  way  for  banks  to  manage  their  liquidity,  with  a 
competitive  auction process, designed to encourage usage, but where  at times some bids 
will go unfilled. 
We  expect  institutions  to  draw  on  this  funding  if  and  when  appropriate,  just  as  we  expect 
them to draw on their own resources as needed in order to provide credit, support markets, 
and generally supply financial services to the real economy. 
In order to have confidence and plan for the future, financial institutions, like the rest of us, 
desire  certainty.  That  is  why  the  Bank  will  continue  to  be very  clear  about  their  regulatory 
framework. Our liquidity framework is now established and effective. Over the past year, the 
FPC has finalised the overall capital framework. We are steadily implementing measures to 
develop ring-fenced banks and to end the scourge of too-big-to-fail.  
Nothing in financial regulation has changed as a result of last week’s referendum. It will not 
change until the process of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union is complete, until 
the UK is no longer a member of the EU and until EU law ceases to have effect in the UK. 
The  law  is  the  law.  Rules  are  rules.  The  Bank  is  continuing  to  implement  the  current 
regulatory framework until any new arrangements with the EU take effect.  
By enhancing the resilience of banks and by providing regulatory certainty so that firms can 
operate and plan with confidence, the Bank of England is ensuring that the financial system 
can continue to provide credit to businesses and households. This progress means that the 
financial system will dampen the aftershocks from recent events rather than amplify them. 
Next  Tuesday,  the  independent  FPC  will  release  its  biannual  assessment  of  risks  in  its 
Financial Stability Report, and it will take any further actions it deems appropriate to support 
financial stability. Consistent with public accountability, we will then take questions from the 
media that day and will testify before Parliament the following week. 
Monetary policy 
3.2 
Let  me  now  turn  to  monetary  policy.  In  May,  the  Monetary  Policy  Committee  set  out  its 
central outlook for steady growth accompanied by a gradual return of inflation to the target. 
As  required  by  our  remit,  the  MPC  identified  that  the  most  significant  risks  to  its  forecast 
concerned the referendum.15 This was the view of all nine independent members of the MPC. 
In  May,  the  MPC  judged  that  a  sustainable  return  of  inflation  to  the  2%  target  probably 
required a gradually rising path for Bank Rate over the next three years as growth picked up, 
jobs  and  wages  increased  and  the  drags  from  a  stronger  currency  and  lower  commodity 
prices faded.

As required by its remit, the MPC has already described how a vote to leave the EU could 
materially alter the outlook for growth and inflation.  
As  a  result  of  increased  uncertainty  and  tighter  financial  conditions,  UK  households  could 
defer  consumption  and  firms  delay  investment,  lowering  labour  demand  and  causing 
unemployment  to  rise.  Through  financial  market  and  confidence  channels,  there  are  also 
risks of adverse spillovers to the global economy.  
At  the  same  time,  supply  growth  is  likely  to  be  lower  over  the  next  three  years,  reflecting 
slower  capital  accumulation  and  the  need  to  reallocate  resources  across  sectors  of  the 
economy.  Both  of  these  forces  may  be  exacerbated  by  higher  uncertainty  and  tighter 
financial conditions.  
Finally,  as  expected,  sterling  has  depreciated  sharply.  For  given  foreign  demand,  this  will 
mean support to net trade, though this may well be dampened by uncertainty around future 
trading  relationships.  A  lower  exchange  rate  will  also  entail  higher  prices  for  imported 
consumer goods, energy and capital goods, and consequently lower real incomes.  
As the MPC said prior to the referendum, the combination of these influences on demand, 
supply and the exchange rate could lead to a materially lower path for growth and a notably 
higher path for inflation than set out in the May Inflation Report. In such circumstances, the 
MPC will face a trade-off between stabilising inflation on the one hand and avoiding undue 
volatility  in  output  and  employment  on  the  other.  The  implications  for  monetary  policy  will 
depend on the relative magnitudes of these effects.  
In my view, and I am not pre-judging the views of the other independent MPC members, the 
economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required 
over the summer. 
The Committee will make an initial assessment on 14 July, and a full assessment complete 
with a new forecast will follow in the August Inflation Report. In August, we will also discuss 
further the range of instruments at our disposal.  
These judgments will benefit from the Bank’s joined-up approach. For example, the PRA’s 
direct  line  of  sight  of  banks,  building  societies  and  insurers,  and  the  FPC’s  oversight  of 
systemic risks, allows the Bank to understand better the net impact of any monetary actions 
on  financial  conditions,  and  ultimately  businesses  and  households.  As  we  have  seen 
elsewhere,  if  interest  rates  are  too  low  (or  negative),  the  hit  to  bank  profitability  could 
perversely reduce credit availability or even increase its overall price.  
There are also interactions between prudential rules and the provision of credit in the face of 
large  macro  uncertainty.  The  Bank  of  England  is  well  positioned  to  understand  these 
interactions  and  will  work  across  its  policy  committees  to  maximise  the  coherence  and 
effectiveness of their efforts. 
I  can  assure  you  that  in  the  coming  months  the  Bank  can  be  expected  to  take  whatever 
action is needed to support growth subject to inflation being projected to return to the target 
over an appropriate horizon, and inflation expectations remaining well anchored.  
Conclusion 
4. 
Above the central arch of this Court Room is a weather vane. Originally installed in 1805, it 
played  a  central  role  in  the  Bank’s  management  of  a  different  type  of  uncertainty  – 
meteorological.  When  the  wind  blew  from  the  east,  ships  would  be  able  to  travel  up  the 
Thames,  meaning  London’s  merchants  would  need  credit  to  purchase  the  cargo.  When  it 
blew  from  the  west,  credit  would  need  to  be  withdrawn.  This  Regency  forecasting  model 
helped the Bank of England to provide an anchor of stability.   
Today,  while  the  economy  is  more  complex  and  our  models  less  reliable,  the  Bank  has 
identified the clouds on the horizon and can see that the wind has now changed direction.

Over the past few months, working closely with the Chancellor and with HM Treasury, we put 
in place contingency plans for the initial market shocks. They are working well. 
Over  the  coming  weeks,  the  Bank  will  consider  a  host  of  other  measures  and  policies  to 
promote monetary and financial stability. 
In short, the Bank of England has a plan to achieve our objectives, and by doing so support 
growth, jobs and wages during a time of considerable uncertainty. 
Part of that plan is ruthless truth telling. And one uncomfortable truth is that there are limits to 
what the Bank of England can do.  
In particular, monetary policy cannot immediately or fully offset the economic implications of 
a  large,  negative  shock.  The  future  potential  of  this  economy  and  its  implications  for  jobs, 
real wages and wealth are not the gifts of monetary policymakers.  
These will be driven by much bigger decisions; by bigger plans that are being formulated by 
others. However, we will relentlessly pursue monetary and financial stability. And by doing so 
we will facilitate the adjustments needed to realise this economy’s full potential.
