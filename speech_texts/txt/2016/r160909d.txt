 Asset Quality of Indian Banks: Way Forward1 
The Indian banks in general, and the Public Sector Banks (PSBs) in particular, are grappling 
with  the  huge  stock  of stressed  assets  that  has piled  up in the  system  over  the  years.  Any 
amount  of  discussion  on  the  whys  and  what  of  stressed  assets  would  therefore  never  be 
enough, if it enables us to discern what led to this phenomenal build-up of non-performing 
assets (NPAs) in our system and determine what we should do to solve them, and identify 
what could be done differently in future. I therefore compliment ASSOCHAM for organising 
a national conference on this topical issue and thank them for giving me an opportunity to 
share my views on the subject.  I only hope this conference leaves us wiser about the problem 
at hand and the solutions to deal with it.  I realise that the issue is complex and believe it will 
be naive to conclude that we go back with solutions that would work overnight.

magnitude and dimensions of the problem (Chart 1 and 2). The total stressed assets in the 
Indian commercial banks have risen to 11.5% with the Public Sector Banks leading the strain 
at  14.5%  as  at  end-March  2016.  They  still  contain  some  amount  of  restructured  assets 
indicating potential for some more pain, albeit of lesser intensity.   
Incremental NPAs  
Let us now look at the year- on- year accretion to the NPAs.  One could see that incremental 
accretion to NPAs is quite substantial (Chart 3). There was a big addition post-AQR exercise.

  Restructured assets 
During the five years to March 2015, banks have resorted to restructuring of loans in many 
cases to postpone recognition of non-performance, or what we now call ‘extend and pretend’, 
rather than using it as a tool to preserve the economic value of the units as intended. As a 
result, until 2016 the restructured assets constituted more than 50% of the stressed assets of 
all  scheduled  commercial  banks  masking  the  actual  extent  of  deterioration  of  the  loan 
portfolios (Charts 6).

   Down the years, as the stress deepened, these assets had to be classified as NPAs as 
work outs of non-viable units did not succeed. The Chart 6 shows that the proportion of these 
assets  was  much  higher  in  public  sector  banks.  The  outstanding  balance  of  these  assets 
declined sharply in 2016 post-AQR, as a major portion of these assets has been classified as 
NPA post-AQR reflecting their true quality (Chart 6).  
Net NPAs 
High levels of NPAs have been progressively causing increasing stress on banks’ earnings. 
As a result, banks’ provisioning capacity has also come under pressure leading to a spike in 
the Net NPAs levels as well (Chart 7). Higher net NPAs indicate lower provision coverage

ratio which should progressively improve as the strain on profitability eases. 
 Some contributory factors 
The reasons for the growth in the NPAs are also not far to seek. Table 1 and the Chart below 
show that the bank debt fuelled the rise in corporate leverage steadily from 2005 to 2011. It is 
worth  noting  that    despite  the  `high  leverage`  being  a  well-established  and  most  widely 
known  risk  factor  of  corporate  lending,  bank  lending  to  industrial  sector  continued  at  an 
average elevated rate of over 20 percent. Do we call this irrational exuberance? Obviously, an

sectoral  concentrations.  Charts  8  and  9  show  that  the  stress  is  higher  in  large  borrowers’ 
accounts. In the overall credit portfolio, share of industrial advances is around 40%.  While 
this is partly justified based on the relatively higher credit intensity of industrial sector, the 
banks have to see the need for proper balance taking into account the risk return trade-off 
especially in the larger loan segment.    
 Risk Management  
The  conference  rightly  highlights  the  key  role  of  risk  management  in  developing  a  less 
stressed loan book. Let me therefore examine the elements of a good credit risk management, 
look at the past and draw some lessons for the future.  
Banks are in the business of taking risks. If they are not taking risks they are not doing 
banking  business.  But,  what  does  taking  risk  mean?  Can  it  mean  taking  chances?  When 
would a measured risk taking be different from recklessness? 
Essentially,  risk  management  would  involve  knowing  the  risk,  measuring  it,  and 
controlling  it  within  the  risk  appetite  of  the  bank  by  using  appropriate  mitigants.  Let  us 
therefore identify the various sources of credit risk. 
The first risk from credit management emanates from the possibility that the business 
does  not  take  off  as  projected.  It  is  likely  that  the  project  report  based  on  which  a  credit 
proposal is submitted is highly optimistic. There is therefore a need to evaluate a proposal for 
how  close  the  projections  might  be  to  reality.  Even  assuming  that  the  projections  were 
reasonable,  there  is  the  possibility  that  external  factors  might  render  the  projections 
unachievable. The usual way to deal with this is to do a sensitivity analysis. The scenarios 
tested should be adequately stressed and plausible. They need to factor in the possibilities that 
arise on account of the fact that India is a lot more open economy now. Competition from 
abroad apart from domestic competition should be visualised and therefore global capacities 
and not just domestic capacity should be the criteria. Banks very often also undermine the 
forex risk embedded in cases which involve liabilities denominated in foreign currency. 
As referred to earlier, during the boom period, underwriting standards did get lowered 
by what one may call irrational exuberance. What could be the right counterbalance in such 
cases? A strong balance sheet of the promoter seems to be an answer. However, it appears 
that there was no adequate effort to assess corporate leverage.  We therefore had situations of 
the promoters ending with much less skin in the game.  What this does is to turn the problem 
of  corporate  insolvency  into  a  problem  of  the  banks  rather  than  that  of  the  promoter. 
Therefore  a  strong  underwriting  system  that  is  properly  steeped  in  understanding  and 
mitigating risks is the first element of credit risk management.  But when would this happen?  
Only when risk culture permeates across the bank. Spreading risk culture is the function of 
the board and top management of the bank. In fact the Basel Committee states as under: 
Banks  should  have  an  effective  independent  risk  management  function,  under  the 
direction of a chief risk officer (CRO), with sufficient stature, independence, resources and 
access to the board 
 
An  important  element  of  underwriting  from  a  risk  perspective  will  be  the  portfolio 
diversification.  A  credit  portfolio  which  is  exposed  to  concentration  by  counterparty, 
geography,  economic  activity  and  the  like  is  more  prone  to  shocks.  There  must  be  proper 
systems  to  monitor  risks  arising  from  concentration  and  systematically  address  them.  We 
have allowed banks to have an exposure up to 15 percent of their capital to a counter party 
and 40 percent to a group.  Banks must be wary of hitting these limits.  Seven exposures of 
15 percent each would make the bank’s capital vulnerable to the fortunes of a few companies.  
There is therefore a move to look at these limits differently.  The linkages will not be through 
ownership alone but also economic relationships. 
An  effective  pre-disbursement  control  is  a  very  important  element  of  credit  risk 
management.  Banks are quite liberal in waiving sanction terms without being mindful of the 
risk mitigant they are letting off go in the process. Almost every condition of sanction is a 
risk mitigant. Sometimes there may be more than one serving the same purpose. A proper 
evaluation of the waivers, modifications and suggestion of alternate measures in substitution 
of waived requirements would go a long way in reducing credit risk. 
It  is  said  that  a  poor  underwriting  can  be  made  up  by  a  strong  post-sanction 
supervision and an excellently appraised credit can be marred by poor monitoring. Let me 
elaborate. Assume that the cost of setting up the plant was overestimated and passed off in 
appraisal. Tight control on release of monies and strong on-site supervision can still mitigate 
the  risk.  On  the  contrary,  a  lax  post-sanction  supervision  can  lead  to  the  promoters  not 
bringing in their contribution in time, money being used for purposes not part of the project 
cost, and the like. 
An important part of the risk management is the manner in which a stressed asset is 
dealt with. By definition one can say that a stressed asset is a loan in which anticipated and or 
unanticipated risks have manifested. Again the entire gamut of activities surrounding a fresh 
underwriting will have to be undertaken. But is that done? It is a matter of concern that the 
exercise  is  many  a  time  directed  towards  postponing  the  recognition  of  stress.  Therefore, 
restructuring of large loans became fashionable to a default that we had to finally put a stop 
to it. We realise that in any part of the world a going concern is better than a gone concern 
and it is more so in our country in the absence of a framework for dealing with insolvency. 
Hopefully, this will be overcome shortly, now that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act has 
been passed. But we are not clear why a bank cannot classify an account as NPA and still 
provide need based credit. The system of restructuring to prevent a downgrade of an account 
puts pressure on the banks because they are building further leverage in an already leveraged 
entity. What it is does is that it takes risk management away from the whole process. 
Theoretically, the “three lines of defence model” has been used traditionally to model 
the  interaction  between  corporate  governance  and  internal  control  systems  of  banks  in  the 
context of management of financial risks. I would explain it with the help of analogy to the 
three lines of defence in football game.  
In football, it is the front line forwards and mid-fielders who set the stage for winning 
the match. If they play with caution and strength, the rest usually follows smoothly. In credit 
risk management, the loan officers and the loan sanctioning authorities constitute the first line 
of  defence.  Being  responsible  for  operational  management, 
they  have  ownership, 
responsibility  and  accountability  for  assessing,  controlling  and  mitigating  risk  in  credit 
exposures together with maintaining effective internal controls. (Figure 1). If they ignore the 
basics  while  selecting  a  project  for  bank  finance,  the  risk  management,  compliance  and 
internal audits would have to work really hard to see that the loan turns out to be profitable 
for the bank. 
The credit risk management function constituting the second line of defence facilitates 
and  monitors  the  implementation  of  effective  risk  management  practices  by  operational 
management. Coming back to our football metaphor, the second line of defence has multiple 
roles. It has to keep a watch on how the forwards are progressing and whether they need to 
call them to modify the strategy. At the same time they have to be in readiness to react should 
the situation suddenly slip out of the forwards’ control. But, it would never be advisable for 
them to leave their place and join the forwards – this would expose the team to attack by the 
opposite team. Thus, the second line should only reinforce what the first line is doing, not to 
replace  them.  In  credit  risk  management,  the  second  line  of  defence  should  assist  the  risk 
owners-  the  credit  department-  in  defining  the  target  risk  exposure  and  reporting  adequate 
risk  related  information  through  the  organisation.  If  this  line  of  defence  is  to  function 
effectively,  this  function  has  to  remain  independent.  The  credit  risk  management  officers 
should not be part of the credit approval committees.  
  Figure 1: Three lines of defence model 
Source: ECIIA/FERMA Guidance on the 8th EU Company Law Directive, Article 41 
The  internal  audit  function  is  the  third  line  of  defence  and  is  expected  to  provide 
assurance  to  the  organisation’s  board  and  senior  management  on  how  effectively  the 
organisation assesses and manages its risks. They particularly look into the manner in which 
the first and second lines of defence operate. The assurance task covers all elements of an 
organisation’s  risk  management  framework,  i.e.  risk  identification,  risk  assessment  and 
response to communication of risk related information. Comparing this with a football match, 
one would not expect the goalkeeper to be running with the forwards past the midfield to hit a 
goal. Also, a team cannot always rely only upon a strong goal keeper to win the match. In 
other words, an internal audit cannot solve all the risk management problems that primarily 
are the responsibility of the operational, risk management and compliance teams. 
RBI has issued detailed instructions to banks on credit risk management including the 
organizational and reporting structure of risk management and internal audit departments. If 
all institutional mechanisms have to function, they must be put in place to play the expected 
role and not just as a tick box compliance. 
The multiple defence line model would not be effective in the following situations 
 
•  Misaligned  incentives  for  risk-takers  in  first  line  of  defence,  which  primarily  arise 
from the emphasis on generating sufficient revenue and profits for the institution. 
 
•  Lack of organisational independence of functions in second line of defence. 
 •  Lack of skills and expertise in second line functions 
  
Inadequate and subjective risk assessment performed by internal audit. 
 
Let me complete discussion on the three lines of defence with the role of the board and 
senior management. After all a big part of the game is won by strategising and mentoring. 
The players should have an executable plan that has assessed the opponent’s strengths and 
weaknesses. The board and the senior management draw up the risk strategy for the bank, set 
the risk appetite for the organisation and allocate roles to each player and group of players. 
They are thus like the coach and the manager of a team. Mind you, if you look at famous 
football leagues, the coach and the manager are an important part of the teams. 
 
Consequences 
If banks continue to remain saddled with huge NPAs for a long time, it would make them risk 
averse and choke the lending for economic activities in general.  Another consequence is the 
likely shift by the PSBs to loan segments such as personal loans and housing loans where the 
banks so far have had lowest NPAs. While this may help in rebalancing the loan portfolio in 
favour of less volatile sectors, care would have to be taken not to overdo this and shift the 
leverage from the corporate sector to household sector. Yet another possibility is the rise in 
the market share of private sector banks in industrial loans. We are seeing this already. This 
would  help  the  viable  businesses  continuing  to  have  access  to  bank  finance  the  broader 
banking sector is still under stress. However, these banks will have to manage the resultant 
credit concentration risk well. Overall, dealing squarely with stressed assets is crucial for the 
nation’s  economic  growth,  which  is  why  the  RBI  and  Government  have  taken  several 
measures in this direction. 
 The Government and RBI Tool Kit 
Steps taken by Government 
The consequences of default in loans are aggravated by poor recovery. In particular, the low 
rate  of  recovery  through  legal  recourse  is  a  cause  for  concern  –  the  annual  recovery  as 
percentage of amount of cases filed under SARFAESI Act, with DRT and Lok Adalats fell 
from  20%  in  2013-14  to  9%  in  2015-16.  With  the  Government  having  notified  the 
amendments to the DRT and SARFAESI Act, we hope to see improvement in the recovery 
process.  The  Insolvency  and  Bankruptcy  Code  is  yet  another  major  step  taken  by 
Government in this direction. The Government has set up a Committee, with four sub-groups, 
to formulate detailed regulations and rules to operationalise the code within a short time span. 
 
  The  Government  has  also  taken  steps  to  improve  the  corporate  governance  of  the 
PSBs.  The  Indradhanush  initiative  -  breaking  up  the  post  of  Chairman  and  Managing 
Director,  strengthening  board  and  management  appointments  through  the  Banks  Board 
Bureau,  decentralizing  more  decisions  to  the  professional  board  and  finding  ways  to 
incentivize management - would contribute to better performance of loan portfolio of banks.  
The Government has also pumped in quite a bit of capital into the banks. 
Regulatory measures 
The phenomenal rise in non-performing assets of banks has engaged considerable attention of 
RBI too. Starting from the framework for dealing with stressed assets in early 2014, we have 
initiated a series of measures to empower banks to deal with stressed assets. Realising that 
information  asymmetry  is  a  major  bottleneck  in  sound  credit  appraisal  and  strong  credit 
monitoring, RBI has created a large loan database (CRILC) that covers all loans over Rs.5 
crore.  The data base is accessible to all the banks. That database allows banks to identify 
incipient sickness that is reflected in repayment behaviour. Leveraging the CRILC database, 
lenders  could  coordinate  their  planning  for  recovery  and  resolution  of  the  affected  unit 
through a Joint Lenders’ Forum (JLF) once early signals of sickness are noticed.   Incentives 
have been given to banks for reaching quick decisions.  We have taken steps to ensure that 
the forum performs efficiently. 
RBI’s  regulations  require  banks  to  classify  loans  into  special  mention  categories 
based on days past due for better monitoring.  While restructuring of loans per se is not a bad 
thing, we have almost put an end to the restructuring of unviable projects by banks and keep 
them classified as standard assets too. At the same time, 5/25 scheme has been designed with 
the  objective  of  allowing  the  borrowers  to  take  the  benefit  of  better  alignment  of  their 
repayment schedule to cash flows to service the debt for a long term project.  We have been 
constantly monitoring the performance of the scheme and tweaking it wherever necessary to 
ensure that it is not misused to evergreen the weak loans and to iron out the wrinkles if any. 
The SDR scheme has been designed to deal with problem loans where promoters need 
to be replaced, whereas the ‘Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets’(S4A) is 
an  optional  framework  for  the  resolution  of  large  stressed  accounts  without  change  of 
promoters.  The  S4A  envisages  determination  of  the  sustainable  debt  level  for  a  stressed 
borrower,  and  bifurcation  of  the  outstanding  debt  into  sustainable  debt  and  equity/quasi-
equity instruments which are expected to provide upside to the lenders when the borrower 
turns around.  This provides an incentive to capable, but overleveraged promoters to perform 
and banks to continue to lend as the project is not deemed an NPA, if adequately provided 
for. 
Indian banks got into stress before full implementation of Basel III and revised IFRS 
which  are  designed  to  provide  protection  against  system  level  stresses.    In  particular,  the 
countercyclical capital buffers and expected loss based provisions would strengthen the banks 
and  create  sufficient  cushions  against  systemic  risk  events.  The  essence  of  all  the  macro-
prudential  and  countercyclical  elements  of  Basel  III  is  that  they  encourage  banks  to  save 
capital in good times for use in bad times.  For Indian banks, the stress has occurred before 
full  implementation  of  Basel  III  and  to  that  extent  they  have  not  had  the  benefits  of  this 
improved capital standard.  Rather, as Basel III is being implemented during a stressed phase, 
Indian banks are under double pressure – to survive the current stress and implement Basel 
III. Hence, external capital support is essential.  
Government of India has already provided the required capital support to the public 
sector banks, although with some conditions regarding the performance. More capital will be 
infused  as  part  of  Indhradhanush.  But  it  is  necessary  that  the  stressed  assets-build  up  is 
contained and the banks get back to generating adequate internal accruals. We are hopeful 
that, once the pain is over, banks would emerge much stronger.  
Malfeasance 
While the RBI believes that businesses can get into financial difficulties and genuine business 
needs should be supported, malfeasance should be properly dealt with.  We have, therefore, 
put in place a detailed system for identifying wilful defaulters and non-cooperative borrowers 
with  attendant  consequences  to  the  borrowers  who  are  so  declared.    We  also  believe  that 
frauds should be sternly dealt with and have created a fraud registry. 
Exploring alternative sources of project finance 
Bank  loans  continue  to  be  a  dominant  source  of  project  finance  except  in  North  America.  
However, owing to the considerable risks for the bank’s balance sheets that arise from such 
long  term  financing,  capital  market  funding  of  project  finance  is  being  explored  and 
consciously promoted in many other countries.  
Chart 10: Trends in bank funding of projects in Europe 
   For  example,  the  bond  funding  of 
projects  in  Europe  has  increased 
from  3%  in  2008  to  23%  in  2014. 
(Chart  10).  We  have 
issued 
guidelines to make large borrowers 
to  go  to  capital  market  for  part  of 
their  funding  needs.  The  revised 
draft  on  large  exposure  has  been 
issued.  We  have  also  increased 
credit enhancement to be provided by banks for bond issuances to make them attractive for 
long term investors. 
 
Conclusion 
Any  bank  which  does  not  have  a  strong  risk  management  is  likely  to  build  a  highly 
susceptible credit portfolio. Risk Management is not static. It evolves over a period of time.  
It need not be the same for all. Its sophistication grows with the growth in the complexities of 
a bank’s functioning. In fact, if a bank’s risk management function is not commensurate with 
the complexity of its operations, it is prone to the risks manifesting and turning beyond its 
risk appetite. Regulators have put in place a framework for risk management. How well to 
operationalise it and how to ensure that the various lines of defence play their expected role 
are in the hands of the board and senior management of a bank.  There is no line of defence 
stronger  than  a  board  and  senior  management  committed  to  sound  risk  management  in  a 
bank. 
Thank you.
