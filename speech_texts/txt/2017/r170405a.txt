Dimitar Radev: Crisis management framework in Bulgaria
Summary of statement by Mr Dimitar Radev, Governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, at the
annual meeting of governors and other central bank representatives from the countries of the
Dutch-Belgian constituency of the IMF, organised by the National Bank of Belgium, Brussels, 24
February 2017.
 The closure of the fourth largest bank in Bulgaria in 2014 put to the test the country’s financial
stability. This incident revealed, among other things, serious limitations in our crisis management
arrangements  in  the  banking  area  and,  more  specifically,  the  lack  of  a  proper  institutional
framework to deal with resolution of systemically important banks.
Our policy response to the 2014 crisis was incorporated in an 18-month plan adopted in mid-
2015, defining concrete actions in three priority areas:
An independent assessment of: (1) the banks in Bulgaria (through an AQR and stress tests
that  were  completed  in  2016),  and  (2)  our  crisis  management  framework  (through  a  still
ongoing  financial  sector  assessment,  FSAP,  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  and  the
World Bank);
A  comprehensive  reform  of  the  Central  Bank’s  banking  supervision  and  regulation
framework and practices, based on the Basel Core Principles (BCP);
Introducing  the  BNB’s  new  bank  resolution  functions  compliant  with  the  European  Bank
Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD).
The  implementation  of  the  plan  helped  build  sound  foundations  for  our  crisis  management
framework. Its main elements now include:
The Financial Stability Advisory Council (FSAC): a consultative body comprising the minister
of finance, the governor of the Central Bank, and the chairman of the Financial Supervision
Commission;
The Central Bank as the designated resolution authority for banks; the resolution function of
the  BNB  is  outlined  in  the  Law  on  Recovery  and  Resolution  of  Credit  Institutions  and
Investment  Firms,  adopted  in  mid-2015,  which  transposed  the  BRRD  in  the  Bulgarian
legislation;
A mechanism to fund resolution measures by the newly established Bank Resolution Fund
(BRF)  which  is  funded  by  contributions  from  the  banks;  the  target  level  of  the  resources
collected  in  the  BRF  is  2%  of  the  amount  of  covered  deposits  of  all  banks  licensed  in
Bulgaria and must be achieved by end-2024;
A comprehensive resolution toolkit directly transposed from the BRRD comprising: (1) the
resolution tools (sale of business; bridge institution, asset separation, and bail-in), and (2)
the government stabilization tools (public equity support and temporary public ownership).
Progress  has  been  already  made  in  operationalizing  the  crisis  management  framework  in
Bulgaria. The key actions so far include:
Regular meetings of the FSAC to assist in developing common policies, better coordination
and exchange of information with a view to maintaining stability and further developing the
financial markets;
Launching  a  new  department  within  the  Central  Bank  with  operational  tasks  and
responsibilities in the area of bank resolution;
Collection of the first contributions from the banks into the BRF, which will amount to nearly

BGN 300 million, including the upcoming 2017 installments;
Approving  the  resolution  plans  for  the  foreign  subsidiaries  belonging  to  banking  groups
operating in Bulgaria.
We have already planned the next steps, which will further build on recent progress. Our efforts
are focused on the following groups of measures:
Expanding  the  FSAC  mandate,  including  for  better  coordination  of  agencies’  contingency
planning in response to situations threatening financial stability;
Creating capacity for the practical application of resolution tools, more specifically the sale of
business, the bridge institution and the bail-in tools, if needed;
Prioritising the resolution planning for domestic systemically important banks; this process is
presently underway but their resolution plans are not yet adopted;
Addressing financial and legal restrictions on liquidity support by the central bank, taking into
consideration  both  the  existing  currency  board  regime  and  the  EU  state-aid  rules  and
procedures for public support to banks.
We  plan  to  apply  the  above  measures  along  with  further  strengthening  banking  supervision,
reducing  bank  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs),  and  further  developing  the  overall  financial  sector
safety net. To this end, we are in the process of preparing:
An  action  plan  for  further  banking  supervision  reforms  with  a  focus  on  developing
supervisory rules and procedures and the relevant IT infrastructure to improve compliance
with the BCP;
A strategy for reduction of NPLs, including the use of macroprudential supervisory review
tools to promote sound bank practices for loan loss provisioning (following the IFRS but also
specifying certain supervisory expectations), NPL write-downs, and collateral valuation;
A joint BNB-MoF strategy for liquidity assistance to solvent banks facing liquidity pressure,
that would ensure compliance with the Central Bank requirements for the highest quality of
collateral.
After the problems in 2014, all key elements of the crisis management framework are available
now in Bulgaria. This framework is built on sound foundations and is fully consistent with the
most  recent  EU  legislation  in  the  credit  institution  resolution  area.  In  spite  of  the  progress
achieved, much remains to be done, mainly for the practical preparations for the implementation,
if  necessary,  of  the  new  rules  and  procedures.  Hence,  our  immediate  efforts  are  aimed  at
making arrangements and developing solutions that would be valid and efficient in the medium
and long term.
