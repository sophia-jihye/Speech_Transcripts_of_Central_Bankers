Joint Session of the Fifth Committees of the
Chamber of Deputies (Budget, Treasury and Planning) and of the 
Senate of the Republic (Economic Planning and Budget)
Preliminary hearing  
on the budgetary provisions  
for the three years 2019-2021 
Testimony of the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy 
Luigi Federico Signorini
Chamber of Deputies
Roma, 9 November 2018
Mr President, Honourable Members of Parliament,
I wish to thank you for giving the Bank of Italy this opportunity to provide its 
technical assessment as part of the consultations on the budgetary provisions.
I  will  make  only  a  brief  reference  to  the  general  economic  situation,  which  I 
described in detail before these committees a month ago.
The information that has become available in recent weeks confirms the signs that the 
economy is weakening. According to the provisional estimate released by Istat, GDP 
stagnated in the third quarter. Our latest assessments are that industrial production was 
basically stationary in September and may have diminished in October. The Purchasing 
Managers’ Index for that month has fallen below the threshold compatible with an 
expansion of production, both in manufacturing and in services. More positive signals 
are coming from the demand side: consumer confidence showed an improvement in 
October, returning to the same level as at the end of last year; according to monthly 
data on foreign trade, goods exports to EU countries increased in the summer. Financial 
market volatility has sharpened and risk premia remain high.
Overall,  given  these  developments,  achieving  the  growth  targets  set  by  the 
Government for next year is an ambitious goal.
The assessment we provided a month ago regarding the macroeconomic effects of 
the budgetary provisions is largely confirmed in the light of the measures under 
discussion.1  The  expansionary  impact  projected  by  the  Government  appears 
considerable.2 As I have already remarked, estimates of the macroeconomic impact 
have a broad margin of uncertainty that also depends on the timing and the details, 
as yet unknown, of some of the measures.
1  In this speech, the budgetary provisions are defined as the full set of measures incorporated in the ‘fiscal decree’ (Decree 
Law 119/2018) and in the draft budget law for 2019.
2  With regard to the multipliers of the Bank of Italy’s econometric model see, for example, the work of Bulligan G., Busetti 
F.,  Caivano  M.,  Cova  P.,  Fantino  D.,  Locarno  A.  and  Rodano  I.,  ‘Il  modello  econometrico  della  Banca  d’Italia:  un 
aggiornamento delle principali equazioni di elasticità’, Banca d’Italia, Temi di Discussione (Working Papers), 1130, July 2017.
1.  The budgetary provisions: an overview
The Government’s budgetary provisions increase net borrowing, with respect to the 
current-legislation projections, by an average of 1.3 percentage points of GDP per 
annum in the three years 2019-2021, de-activating the safeguard clauses for next year 
and reducing, though only slightly, the amount for the following two years.
2019. – The Government plans to carry out expansionary intervention next year to 
the value of €34 billion, just over a third of which will be financed by increasing 
revenue and reducing expenditure. The deficit will increase by almost €22 billion (see 
attached table).
Cancelling the increase in VAT rates and customs duties envisaged by the safeguard 
clauses will lead to a €12.5 billion reduction in revenue.
In 2019, it is planned to introduce the ‘citizen’s income and pension’ and to modify 
the  pension  system,  although  the  details  and  the  method  of  implementation  of 
these measures are yet to be defined. The budgetary provisions simply institute two, 
intercommunicating funds (in the order of €7 billion each) that fix the maximum net 
cost of the prospective measures. The provisions also allocate additional resources for 
public sector investment (€3.5 billion).
Other expansionary measures include expenditure increases worth €3.4 billion and reductions in revenue 
of about €1 billion.
The measures will be financed to the tune of more than two thirds by raising revenue. 
The main contribution will come from an increase in taxation of the financial sector 
and the abolition of the optional tax system applying to some categories of business 
(IRI – tax on unincorporated business income).
The 2019 deficit will come to 2.4 per cent of GDP, which is 1.2 percentage points 
higher  than  the  current-legislation  projection  and  more  than  half  a  percentage 
point  above  the  Government’s  estimate  for  2018.  According  to  the  Government’s 
assessments, structural net borrowing will increase by 0.8 points, to 1.7 per cent. As 
we know, this budget target is under discussion with the European authorities.

Last spring the European Commission deemed that Italy was compliant with the debt-reduction rule even 
though the debt to GDP ratio was not in line with the numerical parameter because it took into account 
the ‘relevant factors’, including, in particular, compliance with the preventive arm of the Stability and 
Growth Pact.
The budget targets set out in last September’s Update to the 2018 Economic and Financial Document 
diverge from the rules of the Pact’s preventive arm. Instead of moving towards equilibrium, the structural 
deficit – that is, net of the effects of the economic cycle and other temporary factors – would increase by 0.8 
percentage points of GDP in 2019 and stabilise in the following two years.
In  a  letter  dated  5  October,  the  European  Commission  requested  a  revision  of  the  budget  targets.  The 
Government confirmed the programme for the next three years by publishing the 2019 Draft Budgetary 
Plan. On 18 October, the Commission noted a ‘clear and significant deviation from the recommendations 
adopted by the Council as part of the Stability and Growth Pact’ and asked the Government to provide a 
justification. Given the deviation, and considering that, as in the past, the reduction in the debt to GDP is 
not in line with the numerical benchmark, the debt reduction rule will not be respected. On 22 October, 
the Government confirmed its plans, citing the need to support the economy, and engaged to take all the 
measures necessary to avoid overshooting the projected net borrowing level.
On 23 October, the Commission issued a negative opinion on the Draft Budgetary Plan. As well as noting 
the failure to comply with the rules of the Pact for 2019, the Commission expressed the opinion that some of 
the prospective measures (notably the tax amnesty and the change in pension requirements) could represent 
a step backwards with respect to past reforms and that, should the downside risks for economic performance 
projected by the Parliamentary Budget Office materialise, the deterioration in the public finances in 2019 
would be greater than forecast by the Government. The Commission asked Italy to present a new Draft 
Budgetary Plan by 13 November. On 29 October, the Commission also announced that it would re-assess 
Italy’s position with regard to the debt reduction rule and asked the country to submit all the elements it 
regarded as significant for an overall assessment of compliance with European budget rules. On 5 November, 
the Eurogroup stated that it was in agreement with the European Commission’s assessment and hoped that, 
through an open and constructive dialogue, Italy would cooperate with the Commission in drawing up a 
new Draft Budgetary Plan that was compliant with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Were the Commission to re-issue a negative opinion on Italy’s plan, it could recommend that the Council 
open an excessive deficit procedure.
2020-2021.  –  The  expansionary  measures  will  be  greater  in  these  two  years  (on 
average by almost €37 billion per year) as a result of extending the regime forfettario 
and introducing a substitute tax for sole proprietorships and self-employed workers, 
granting a special tax rate for firms that re-invest their profits, as well as increasing the 
funds allocated to public investment and public sector employment.
As to the financing of these measures, the absence of the temporary revenue from 
the 2019 measures relating to the financial sector will be offset by abolishing the 
ACE (tax allowance for corporate equity) and taking action to counter tax evasion.
In  the  Government’s  policy  scenario,  while  the  deficit  will  continue  to  be 
significantly  higher  than  the  current-legislation  projection,  it  will  begin  to 
5
diminish again in 2020-2021. A contribution will come from the increase in VAT 
and customs duties as a result of activating the remaining part of the safeguard 
clauses:  these  will  yield  0.7  percentage  points  of  GDP  in  2020  and  0.8  points 
in 2021. The Government has in any case already announced that it will not in 
fact apply this increase, but will instead replace it with other, as yet unspecified, 
measures to reduce expenditure and improve tax collection.
In the period 2020-21, structural net borrowing is expected to remain unchanged 
at  the  level  estimated  for  2019.  The  Government  intends  to  resume  the  path  of 
adjustment in 2022, the first year after the end of the planning horizon; this could be 
brought forward, but only if GDP and employment return to their pre-crisis levels 
before the end of 2021.
2.  The main expansionary measures
More  than  three  quarters  of  the  additional  expenditure  envisaged  under  the 
budgetary provisions (on average €24.2 billion per year) will be used to create or 
increase the Funds set up to finance the introduction of the ‘citizen’s income and 
pension’,  to  lower  the  minimum  requirements  for  obtaining  a  pension,  and  to 
revive public investment.3
In the first two instances, resources will be set aside for reforms that have not yet 
been finalised. Moreover, if the expenditure of one of the funds proves to be lower 
than expected, the residual amount may be transferred to the other.
It is also the Government’s intention to set up special tax regimes for self-employed 
workers and sole proprietorships, as well as to provide incentives for businesses. 
The  cost  of  these  measures  will  mainly  concern  the  two  years  2020-21.  Lastly, 
funds will be set aside for public sector employment.
The Fund for the ‘citizen’s income and pension’. – The Fund for the introduction 
of the ‘citizen’s income and pension’ will have a total endowment of €9 billion 
per annum (about €7 billion net of the sums coming from the Fund to combat 
3  For public sector investment, this also includes the funds allocated to local governments.
6
poverty, which are presently set aside to finance the ‘minimum income scheme’). 
The  draft  budget  law  only  indicates  the  purpose  of  the  measures:  combating 
poverty, inequality and social exclusion and guaranteeing the right to work.
Following the economic crisis, the absolute poverty ratio has risen considerably 
among households, from 3.5 per cent in 2007 to 6.9 per cent in 2017. The increase 
has been particularly marked (from 1.9 to 9.6 per cent) among households with 
a younger ‘reference person’, i.e. under 35 years of age, which include a larger 
proportion  of  foreigners  (in  2016,  in  60  per  cent  of  younger  poor  households 
the reference person was foreign). Instead, the poverty ratio is stable – and below 
average – for households whose head is over 65 years of age (4.8 per cent in 2007 
and 4.6 per cent in 2017).
Given the amount of resources allocated, the ‘citizen’s income’ should be considerably 
more generous than the current ‘inclusion income scheme’, not only as regards its 
amount but also in terms of the number of beneficiaries. It is very important, therefore, 
that it should be designed so as not to discourage the supply of regular employment by 
providing for efficacious incentives and sufficient checks to prevent misuse.4
The budgetary provisions allocate part of the Fund’s resources (€1 billion in 2019 
and in 2020) to reinforce the employment centres, which at the moment play only 
a marginal role in matching the demand and supply of labour.
If the measures to reinforce the employment centres are to be promptly effective, organisational and regulatory 
changes will almost certainly be needed as well. Responsibility for the employment centres is split between 
several levels of government, and the ways in which they cooperate with private sector agencies continue 
to be ill-defined despite the institution of the National Agency for Active Labour Policies in 2015. We 
calculate, based on Istat data, that in 2017, only slightly over 25 per cent of job-seekers contacted an 
employment centre; the share of unemployed workers who found permanent work in the private sector 
through an employment centre was 2 per cent. People who, because of individual and family characteristics, 
are at greatest risk of poverty make even less recourse to the employment centres and are less likely to find 
work through them. Even in countries with greater experience of active labour policies, the likelihood of an 
unemployed worker finding a job through an employment centre is not high: in 2016, the proportion in 
France and Germany was 7 per cent. 
Lastly, in areas with low labour demand in particular, it is important for the employment 
centres to be able to pass on job proposals originating in other regions.

Governor of the Bank of Italy, L. F. Signorini, Chamber of Deputies, Rome, 9 October 2018.

Pension system revision fund. – The budget establishes a ‘Fund for the revision of the 
pension system through the introduction of additional forms of early retirement as 
well as incentives for hiring younger workers’. The Fund will have an endowment of 
€6.7 billion in 2019 and €7 billion starting in 2020.
Given that the information on the measures planned is incomplete, it is not possible 
at this stage to comment on the possible effects.
As we have said several times in the past, it is certainly possible to make the current 
rules  more  flexible,  for  example  as  regards  minimum  pension  requirements.  In 
our opinion, however, intervention of this kind should recognise that the financial 
sustainability and intergenerational equity of our system is based on the relationship 
between  contributions  paid  in  and  benefits  paid  out.  In  other  words,  the  amount 
of an early retirement pension should be adjusted in line with the lower amount of 
contributions and the anticipated longer disbursement period. Failure to meet this 
criterion would jeopardise the system’s long-term equilibrium, increasing the burden 
on future generations.
Public investment. – A substantial share of resources is allocated to public investment: 
a total of around €16 billion over the three-year period (€3.5 billion in 2019, €5.6 
billion  in  2020  and  €6.5  billion  in  2021),  of  which  almost  €9  billion  for  central 
government investment and the rest for local government investment.
General  government  expenditure  on  gross  fixed  investment  has  declined  very 
considerably in recent years, more than in the rest of the euro area. In nominal terms 
it has decreased by almost 4 per cent a year on average compared with 2008; as a 
percentage of GDP, it has fallen from 3 per cent in 2008 to 2 per cent. The largest 
reduction has been at local government level.
The analyses at our disposal suggest that Italy lags significantly behind its European 
partners  in  this  respect.5  Italy’s  delay  is  not  only  due  to  scarce  financial  resources: 
compared with other countries, costs and average implementation times are higher, 
even when taking differences between areas into account.
5  See ‘Public investment for developing the economy’, address by Ignazio Visco,  Governor of the Bank of Italy, at the 64th 
Conference on Government Studies, Varenna, 22 September 2018.

Fixed investment by local government departments (excluding the effects of privatization receipts) fell by 
almost 40 per cent between 2008 and 2017 (to €18.3 billion), reaching the lowest point in terms of ratio 
to GDP of the last 40 years. The decline was common to all areas of the country, but was especially evident 
in the regions of the South and Islands.
The failure of local investment to gain momentum in recent years may be due in part to the friction caused 
by an overlapping of the implementation phases of several reforms, and particularly to the misalignment 
between the new harmonised accounting standards (which came into force in 2015) and the balanced 
budget principle (applied since 2016, replacing the Internal Stability Pact).
The Draft Budgetary Law simplifies the framework of the rules to which local authorities are subject by 
bringing the method of computing the outturn for harmonised accounting closer into line with the method 
used for the outturn considered for compliance with the balanced budget principle, thereby freeing up funds 
to allocate for investment. All the local authorities will be affected by the changeover, except the special 
statute regions, for which the new system will come into force in 2021.
On several occasions we have argued that it is desirable to shift public spending from 
current  to  investment  expenditure.  Investment  spending,  in  addition  to  boosting 
demand (as its multipliers are usually higher than those of current expenditure), helps 
to raise the productive potential of the economy as long as the projects are carefully 
selected and efficiently implemented. It can also help to adopt transparent cost-benefit 
analyses when selecting projects and procedures to ensure the efficient and relatively 
rapid execution of the work.
It is important to underline that for the macroeconomic effects expected in 2019 to be 
fully deployed the measures need to be implemented from the beginning of the year.
The budgetary provisions also envisage the creation of two new organisational units: the Central Office for 
Public Works Planning and InvestItalia. The role of the Central Office will be to assist government departments, 
both central and local, in the assessment of the economic and financial aspects of any intervention, during the 
planning stage, and throughout the project management. InvestItalia will be charged with analysing and 
evaluating plans for tangible and intangible investment, assessing the needs for infrastructure modernisation, 
checking  the  state  of  progress  of  work,  and  preparing  financial  and  legal  feasibility  studies.  A  potential 
overlapping of competences between the two new units and between them and other existing bodies needs to 
be clarified.
Special tax regimes for sole proprietorships and self-employed workers. – The 
budget provides for a reduction in the tax burden for sole proprietorships and self-
employed workers. From 2019 the scope of the regime forfettario for small businesses 
will be extended, with an increase in the turnover threshold to €65,000; from 2020 
a  new  substitute  tax  regime  will  be  introduced  for  taxpayers  with  a  turnover  of 
between €65,000 and €100,000. These measures will entail a decrease in revenue of 
€0.3 billion in 2019, €1.9 billion in 2020 and €2.5 billion when fully operational.
9
Currently, the regime forfettario applies to taxpayers that meet certain requirements regarding the amount 
of their annual turnover (which must be below a threshold ranging from €25,000 to €50,000 depending 
on their branch of activity), the amount of their expenditure on auxiliary workers, permanent employees 
and collaborators, and the cost of capital goods. From 2019 the threshold for annual revenue would be 
raised for all branches of activity to €65,000; the other requirements would lapse. The regime forfettario 
would have a tax rate of 15 per cent, calculated on a fixed tax base that is the result of applying to turnover 
different profit margin ratios according to the branch of activity. This tax would replace IRPEF and IRAP, 
and businesses opting for the regime forfettario would not be subject to VAT. There would also be a 35 per 
cent reduction in social security contributions for sole proprietorships.
The substitute tax system that would come into force in 2020 envisages a 20 per cent tax rate, which in 
this case would be based on analytically computed income. There would be no reductions in social security 
contributions.
It can be estimated that the number of taxpayers subject to the regime forfettario 
will increase by around 60 per cent.6 About half of this increase will be the result 
of the higher turnover threshold. For new beneficiaries, we estimate that their tax 
rate will be reduced by an average of about 4 percentage points, to 11 per cent. 
For those who will benefit from the substitute tax regime from 2020, the 20 per 
cent preferential tax rate will reduce the average rate by about 7 points.
Although the objective of simplification is laudable, some efficiency and equality 
issues raised by these measures will have to be carefully evaluated. The step effects 
at the thresholds of €65,000 and €100,000 could discourage firms from expanding 
and encourage elusive or evasive behaviour in order to keep income levels below the 
thresholds. Furthermore, the tax burdens of people with similar incomes could vary 
considerably.
Incentives for businesses. – The Government partially confirms some business 
incentives for high-tech investments and, under certain conditions, is introducing 
a special tax rate for firms that re-invest their profits. The effects on the public 
accounts will be modest in the first year of application; in 2020-21 they will be 
considerable (almost €2.5 billion a year).
For  tech-intensive  investments  the  budget  extends  the  hyper-amortisation  measure, 
the size of which depends on the amount of the investment concerned (over certain 
6  Calculations based on the BIMic microsimulation. For a description of the model, see N. Curci, M. Savegnago and M. 
Cioffi (2017), ‘BIMic: the Bank of Italy microsimulation model for the Italian tax and benefit system’, Banca d’Italia, 
Questioni di Economia e Finanza (Occasional Papers), 394.

thresholds, the special treatment would be cancelled). The incentive has so far supported 
the adoption of advanced technologies, whose returns can be as high as they are uncertain.
While abolishing the ACE, which was designed to strengthen firms’ capital, the budget 
provides  for  the  introduction  of  a  special  tax  treatment  in  the  case  of  re-invested 
profits to increase employment and invest in tangible capital goods. This measure is a 
permanent one. It will benefit firms when they make a profit, thus being more effective 
in favourable phases of the economic cycle. 
The  aim  of  the  measures  –  to  support  investment  and  employment  –  is  certainly 
commendable,  but  when  introducing  changes  to  incentive  schemes,  it  should  be 
borne in mind that the stability and simplicity of the framework are among the most 
important ‘boundary’ conditions for business activity.
Public sector employment. – The budget allocates €2.9 billion, distributed over the 
three-year period, for the renewal of the contract for public sector employees. This is 
in addition to the amounts already allocated today (about €1.5 billion). According to 
official estimates, the total amount of funds available would lead to an increase in average 
wages over the three years, reaching just under 2 per cent when fully phased in.
Compensation of public sector employees as a share of GDP diminished by over 1 percentage point from 2011 
to 2017, falling to 9.5 per cent at the end of last year. It decreased less in the euro area over the same period (0.8 
percentage points), reaching 9.8 per cent. From 2011 to 2017, compensation of public sector employees in Italy 
fell by more than 10 per cent in real terms, while it was basically stable on average in the euro-area countries.
The  draft  budget  law  also  authorises  the  recruitment,  in  addition  to  what  is 
possible under current legislation, of more than 15,000 public sector employees, 
allocating over €1.5 billion for this purpose over the three years. 
There has been a sharp contraction in staff turnover in general government since 2012. This resulted in a 
decrease of around 135,000 jobs per year between 2011 and 2017. For the three-year period 2016-18, 
expenditure on newly recruited staff is limited to 25 per cent of the expenditure on staff terminated in the 
previous year. According to the current-legislation projections set out in last April’s Economic and Financial 
Document, public sector employment is expected to stabilise next year.
In past years, the limits on staff turnover and the collective bargaining freeze helped 
considerably to keep current expenditure down: between 2010 and 2017, primary 
11
current  expenditure  increased  on  average  by  about  1  per  cent  per  annum,  while 
expenditure on compensation of employees decreased by an average of 0.7 per cent.
After several years of restriction, a cautious easing can be justified. However, it will 
be important to make use of the opportunity of contract renewals to introduce 
or strengthen incentive mechanisms, and to ensure that the recruitment of new 
public sector employees takes due account of the skills, including emerging ones, 
that are needed to improve the efficiency of general government.
3.  Funding
On average, over the next three years, the budgetary provisions would generate 
resources of around €11 billion per year, enough to cover just under a third of the 
expansionary measures; the remainder will increase the deficit to the extent I have 
already mentioned.
The increase in revenue would amount to almost €9 billion per annum for the 
next three years. In 2019 more than half would come from a temporary increase 
in  taxation  on  the  financial  sector;  in  the  following  two  years  the  loss  of  this 
temporary revenue would be offset by the cancellation of ACE and by the measures 
to counter tax evasion and recoup revenue.
Other revenue measures of note include the abolition of the tax on unincorporated 
business income (IRI), which was otherwise due to come into force on 1 January 
2019.
The tax on unincorporated business income was expected to reduce taxation by nearly €2 billion in 
the first year and about €1.3 billion from 2020. The optional system, which reduced taxation of sole 
proprietorships and partnerships with a basic accounting system in order to achieve tax neutrality with 
respect to their form of incorporation, was introduced in the 2017 Budget Law and should have taken 
effect from 2018. Last year, its entry into force was postponed until 2019; under the draft budget law 
it will be abolished.
The spending cuts would amount to €3.7 billion next year, €1.5 billion in 2020, 
and €2.2 billion in 2021. Over the next three years, the cuts will represent, on 
average, more than one fifth of the resources generated by the budgetary provisions. 
These include, in 2019, the deferral to the following two-year period of capital 
transfers to the Italian State Railways.
12
Like last year, part of the cost savings will come from cuts to ministries’ spending 
budgets (€1.6 billion on average per annum over the three-year period).
About a third of these cuts would come from rationalising expenditure on management of the immigration 
centres; a reduction in military spending would be included (cumulatively €0.5 billion in the three years).
The other measures to reduce expenditure would include new, lower limits on tax credits for R&D (the 
deductible amount would drop from 50 to 25 per cent and the ceiling would be brought down from €20 to 
€10 million). The expected saving would amount to about €0.3 billion in each of the two years 2020-21.
Financial  sector  taxation.  –  The  budgetary  provisions  raise  taxation  on  the 
banking and insurance sectors in the next three years: by €4.3 billion in 2019, €0.5 
billion in 2020 and €0.8 billion in 2021. The measures envisaged postpone the 
deductibility of a number of cost items and increase the amount of tax advances; 
accordingly, they have a deferment effect.   
The abolition of the ACE, recalled earlier, will make future recapitalisations more 
burdensome for financial intermediaries as well. 
As far as banks are concerned, the budgetary provisions would include changes to the deductibility, on the 
one hand, of loan write-downs associated with the start of IFRS9 and, on the other, of cost items resulting 
in tax deferred assets convertible into tax credits (these are loan write-downs made up to 2015 as well 
as depreciation allowances for goodwill and other intangibles entered in the balance sheet up to 2014). 
Overall, these measures would produce an increase of €4.8 billion in revenue in the next three years, which 
would be offset by a reduction in receipts of the same amount in the following years.
For the insurance sector, the budgetary provisions envisage an increase in the tax paid on account on insurance 
premiums. Currently, following the increases introduced in the 2018 Budget Law, the tax paid on account 
amounts to 59 per cent for 2019 and 74 per cent for the years after. The provisions would increase this to 85 
per cent in 2019, 90 per cent in 2020 and 100 per cent in 2021. The expected revenue in the next three years 
is officially estimated at about €0.8 billion. Again, this would represent an advance on revenue.
The fight against tax evasion and measures to recoup revenue. – Revenue from 
the fight against tax evasion and the recovery of tax receipts, which are relatively 
modest in 2019 (€0.6 billion), represents over one quarter of the total funding in 
2020 and almost one third in 2021 (€2.7 and €3.6 billion respectively).
More than half of the revenue (€0.3, €1.4 and €1.9 billion in 2019, 2020 and 
2021 respectively) is expected to come from the introduction on 1 January 2020 
(1 July 2019 for firms with a turnover above €400,000) of mandatory electronic 
transmission  of  data  on  daily  collections  deriving  from  the  sale  of  goods  and 
13
services. This measure should favour the emergence of the tax base in transactions 
with final consumers, thanks to the greater timeliness of the information available 
to the national revenue agency.  
For the two years 2019-20, there would be a contribution of 50 per cent towards the cost of purchasing or 
adapting the data recording and transmission equipment required by the regulation, up to a maximum of 
€250 for purchases and €50 for adaption.
The remainder of the revenue is mostly of a temporary nature, stemming primarily 
from the redefinition and expansion of the procedure for the settlement of tax 
liabilities first introduced under the 2017 budgetary package. Taken together, the 
provisions are expected to generate an increase in revenue of €1.5 billion per year 
on average in 2020 and 2021.
The budget also makes provision for the automatic cancellation of debts of up to 
€1,000 on individual tax bills assigned to revenue collectors from 1 January 2000 
to 31 December 2010 and a new tax amnesty, to which no increase in revenue is 
prudentially ascribed.
Under the amnesty, taxpayers would be able to use the DIS tax adjustment form to declare taxable amounts 
not reported up to 31 December 2017. The adjustment, to be submitted by 31 May 2019, would be 
permissible up to a limit of €100,000 yearly taxable amount and in any case could not exceed 30 per cent 
of declared income. The additional taxable amounts reported would be taxed without adding any fines, 
interest or other fees and at lower rates than those normally applying (with the exception of VAT). The sums 
owed could be paid in ten half-yearly instalments.
The introduction of mandatory electronic transmission of collections data, along 
with the other instruments to combat tax evasion adopted in recent years (such as 
the split payment mechanism, new compensation procedures between tax credits 
and debts, and the extension of e-invoicing to the private sector), aims to exploit 
the increased availability of data to make controls more incisive and at the same 
time to encourage greater voluntary compliance and cooperation between taxpayers 
and the revenue agency. If properly implemented, it can help achieve a structural 
improvement in the efficiency, fairness and transparency of tax collection.
Other measures, especially the tax amnesty, could discourage the regular fulfilment 
of tax obligations; they should therefore be weighed very carefully.

The growth gap between Italy and the rest of the euro area is a structural problem. 
Its most salient features were recalled a few days ago by the Governor of the Bank 
of  Italy:7  low  productivity  of  firms;  a  population  that  is  on  average  older  than 
that of other countries; a lower rate of labour force participation; young people 
and  adults  with  gaps  in  knowledge  and  skills  compared  with  other  Europeans; 
general government that is somewhat inefficient; a less favourable business climate 
than elsewhere; little public and private investment. The list is well known, has 
been  widely  discussed  and  is,  I  believe,  the  subject  of  broad  consensus.  As  the 
Governor recently affirmed, ‘the road to structural reform requires a significant 
commitment, as results mature slowly. Yet reform is essential’. 
The reforms implemented in recent years, or rather decades, have begun to bear 
fruit. The recovery has generated more jobs than might have been expected: even 
if GDP remains about 4 per cent below its 2007 level, the number of persons 
in employment has reached a historical high. The labour force participation rate 
of  women  and  people  in  the  higher  age  brackets  has  increased.  The  pension 
system has returned to a sustainable path, following two decades of reform that 
has  risen  to  the  challenge  of  an  ageing  population.  More  recently  there  have 
been improvements in the administration of justice and on other fronts. Much, 
however, remains to be done to tackle the outstanding issues. This is the best way 
to increase future economic growth potential and thereby to create the resources 
needed to combat poverty and alleviate the hardship of those who have been left 
behind.
While  useful  in  especially  adverse  cyclical  phases,  an  expansionary  fiscal  policy 
does not guarantee growth in the medium term, and in the long run can jeopardise 
it.  Between  2000  and  2006,  before  the  global  financial  crisis,  Italy  achieved  a 
fiscal expansion of almost 5 percentage points of GDP, compared with 1 point 
in the rest of the euro area. In the same period our economy grew at an average 
rate of 1.5 per cent, against 2.3 per cent in the rest of the area. In those years the 
deterioration in the primary surplus, which declined from almost 4 to less than 1 
per cent, corresponded with the interruption of the gradual reduction of the debt 
to GDP ratio, which was substantially unchanged at just over 100 per cent after 
falling by 12 percentage points in the previous six years.     
7  See the speech by the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Ignazio Visco, delivered at the 2018 World Savings Day organised by 
the Associazione di Fondazioni e di Casse di Risparmio SpA, Rome, 31 October 2018.
15
When  the  financial  crisis  struck,  the  already  high  deficit  and  debt  reduced  the 
room for manoeuvre of fiscal policy, hindering its full anticyclical deployment. 
Without such a high debt, Italy would not have suffered the consequences of the 
sovereign debt crises as violently as it did; it would not have been obliged to adopt 
markedly pro-cyclical fiscal policies in 2011 and 2012 to preserve investor trust 
and to avert the risk of being unable to refinance the public debt.
From  2014  to  2017,  as  financial  conditions  stabilised,  the  fiscal  policy  stance 
turned expansionary (by a little over half a percentage point per year on average). 
The primary surplus remained at around 1.5 per cent of GDP and the ratio of debt 
to GDP stabilised at just above 130 per cent. We said last year, at the preliminary 
hearing on the 2017 Update to the Economic and Financial Document, that to 
plot a gradual, but assured, path to debt reduction from these levels was the ‘bare 
minimum’ required and that the commitment to ensure orderly public finances 
had to be credible in order to avert a widening of the gap between the cost of the 
public debt and economic growth and therefore a deterioration in debt dynamics. 
The Government shares the aim of reducing the ratio of public debt to GDP. This 
goal  is  nonetheless  pursued  not  by  focusing  on  the  achievement  of  budgetary 
balance but rather on the stimulus imparted by fiscal expansion. It envisages a 
significant reduction in the primary surplus in 2019; it does not contemplate a 
rebalancing in subsequent years.    
Econometrics is not an exact science, even though its statistical and mathematical 
tools are highly formalised; assessments of the impact on the economic cycle of the 
prospective expansionary measures might well vary depending on the hypotheses 
adopted  and  the  models  employed.  The  multipliers  implicit  in  the  budgetary 
provisions  ought  to  be  considered  relatively  high,  even  if  there  is  widespread 
uncertainty  about  their  estimated  value.  Much  will  depend  on  how  and  when 
the  measures  are  implemented.  The  selection  of  investments  and  their  timely 
commencement will also be important.    
The effects of fiscal policy, however, cannot be assessed as though it existed in a 
void; they are affected by the broader financial conditions, especially important 
when the debt is so high, which in turn are influenced by announcements and 
policies. The protracted uncertainty of investors about Italy’s fiscal plans and the 
credibility of its commitment to bring the debt steadily down, and last, but by no 
means least, the debate with the EU bodies on compliance with the common rules, 
16
have considerably raised the interest rates that Italy pays on its debt. This increase 
has  already  cost  taxpayers  almost  €1.5  billion  in  additional  interest  expense  in 
the last six months, compared with what it would have accrued at the rates that 
the markets expected in April; if the rates remain consistent with current market 
expectations, it would cost over €5 billion in 2019 and around €9 billion in 2020.
As the Governor explained in the same speech I mentioned earlier, the increase 
in the sovereign spread affects the entire economy (households, firms, financial 
institutions). The increase in interest rates on the public debt has an effect that is 
somewhat comparable to a monetary squeeze; a squeeze which, however, is much 
sharper and more rapid than any imaginable (future, gradual) normalisation of 
the Eurosystem’s policy. This risks thwarting the expansionary stimulus expected 
from fiscal policy.
Faced with a possible new recession Italy would find itself with a relatively high 
deficit, as before the crisis, and an even higher debt to GDP ratio. The room for 
manoeuvre would be even narrower.
It is not my role to provide indications or formulate precise forecasts, which would 
in any case be impossible, but to highlight the risks. I believe there is a general 
consensus that the danger of triggering a vicious circle of deficit, interest rates, 
confidence and growth has to be avoided. Given the present international financial 
situation, unexpected episodes of volatility cannot be ruled out, however unlikely 
they may seem at the moment. Instead, credible control over the dynamics of the 
deficit and the debt is self-fuelling, and in the final analysis it will expand the 
amount of resources available to the community.
The spread has to be reduced. The signals captured by investors are important.
I hope, therefore, that the discussions under way with the European Commission 
and Council will lead to a solution that de facto reconciles compliance with the 
rules that bind Italy as a member of the Monetary Union, and ensures a credible 
process of consolidation in the medium term, with judicious measures to support 
the economy and with the pursuit of the political objectives of the Government 
and Parliament.
